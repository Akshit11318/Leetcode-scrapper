## Game Play Analysis II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a table `Activity` with columns `player_id`, `device_id`, `event_date`, and `games_played`, we need to analyze game play data. The constraints are that `player_id` and `device_id` are integers, `event_date` is a date, and `games_played` is an integer.
- Expected output format: We need to find the total number of games played by each player.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The `event_date` column is crucial as it determines the order of events. We should also consider cases where a player plays multiple games on the same day.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For example, if we have the following data:
    | player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
    |-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
    | 1         | 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
    | 1         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
    | 2         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 7            |
    | 2         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 8            |
  - We should return the total number of games played by each player.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can iterate over each row in the `Activity` table and sum up the `games_played` for each `player_id`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a dictionary to store the total games played by each player.
  2. Iterate over each row in the `Activity` table.
  3. For each row, add the `games_played` to the corresponding player's total in the dictionary.
  4. Return the dictionary with the total games played by each player.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach to solve the problem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

struct Activity {
    int player_id;
    int device_id;
    std::string event_date;
    int games_played;
};

std::unordered_map<int, int> gamePlayAnalysisII(std::vector<Activity>& activity) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> player_games;
    for (const auto& act : activity) {
        if (player_games.find(act.player_id) != player_games.end()) {
            player_games[act.player_id] += act.games_played;
        } else {
            player_games[act.player_id] = act.games_played;
        }
    }
    return player_games;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Activity` table, because we iterate over each row once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might need to store every player in the dictionary.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we need to iterate over each row in the table, and the space complexity occurs because we need to store the total games played by each player.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using a single pass through the data, which is already done in the brute force approach.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a dictionary to store the total games played by each player.
  2. Iterate over each row in the `Activity` table.
  3. For each row, add the `games_played` to the corresponding player's total in the dictionary.
  4. Return the dictionary with the total games played by each player.
- Proof of optimality: The time complexity is already $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem because we need to read the input data at least once.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We cannot do better than $O(n)$ time complexity because we need to read the input data at least once.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

struct Activity {
    int player_id;
    int device_id;
    std::string event_date;
    int games_played;
};

std::unordered_map<int, int> gamePlayAnalysisII(std::vector<Activity>& activity) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> player_games;
    for (const auto& act : activity) {
        player_games[act.player_id] += act.games_played;
    }
    return player_games;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration over data, dictionary usage.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Single-pass data processing.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the problem is already solved optimally.
- Similar problems to practice: Other data analysis problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the dictionary before using it.
- Edge cases to watch for: Players with no games played, players with multiple games played on the same day.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a data structure with worse time complexity than a dictionary.
- Testing considerations: Test with different input sizes, test with edge cases.
