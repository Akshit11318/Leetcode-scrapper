## Minimum Swaps to Make Sequences Increasing
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-make-sequences-increasing/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two integer arrays `seq1` and `seq2`, both of length `n`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= seq1[i], seq2[i] <= 1000`.
- Expected Output: The minimum number of swaps to make the sequences increasing.
- Key Requirements: A swap operation involves exchanging elements at the same index in both sequences.
- Edge Cases: Sequences may not be increasing initially, and a swap can only be made if the elements at the swapped positions are not already in increasing order.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `seq1 = [1,3,5,4]`, `seq2 = [1,2,3,7]`. The minimum number of swaps to make the sequences increasing is 1 (swap the last two elements).
- `seq1 = [1,3,5,4]`, `seq2 = [1,2,3,6]`. No swaps are needed as the sequences are already increasing.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible combination of swaps to find the minimum number of swaps required.
- This approach comes to mind first because it guarantees finding the solution by exhaustively searching all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minSwaps(vector<int>& seq1, vector<int>& seq2) {
    int n = seq1.size();
    int minSwaps = n;

    // Generate all permutations of swaps
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        vector<int> tempSeq1 = seq1;
        vector<int> tempSeq2 = seq2;
        int swaps = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                swap(tempSeq1[i], tempSeq2[i]);
                swaps++;
            }
        }

        // Check if the sequences are increasing
        bool isIncreasing = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (tempSeq1[i] <= tempSeq1[i - 1] || tempSeq2[i] <= tempSeq2[i - 1]) {
                isIncreasing = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isIncreasing) {
            minSwaps = min(minSwaps, swaps);
        }
    }

    return minSwaps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of the sequences. This is because we generate all permutations of swaps ($2^n$) and check each permutation in $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the temporary sequences.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible permutations of swaps, which leads to an exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we only need to store the temporary sequences.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is using dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum number of swaps required to make the sequences increasing up to each index.
- We maintain two arrays, `dp` and `dpSwap`, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of swaps required to make the sequences increasing up to index `i` without swapping at index `i`, and `dpSwap[i]` represents the minimum number of swaps required to make the sequences increasing up to index `i` with swapping at index `i`.

```cpp
int minSwaps(vector<int>& seq1, vector<int>& seq2) {
    int n = seq1.size();
    vector<int> dp(n, INT_MAX);
    vector<int> dpSwap(n, INT_MAX);

    dp[0] = 0;
    dpSwap[0] = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (seq1[i] > seq1[i - 1] && seq2[i] > seq2[i - 1]) {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1]);
            dpSwap[i] = min(dpSwap[i], dpSwap[i - 1] + 1);
        }

        if (seq1[i] > seq2[i - 1] && seq2[i] > seq1[i - 1]) {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dpSwap[i - 1]);
            dpSwap[i] = min(dpSwap[i], dp[i - 1] + 1);
        }
    }

    return min(dp[n - 1], dpSwap[n - 1]);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the sequences. This is because we only need to iterate through the sequences once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the `dp` and `dpSwap` arrays.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum number of swaps required to make the sequences increasing up to each index, avoiding redundant calculations and ensuring that we consider all possible swaps.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The problem demonstrates the use of dynamic programming to solve a complex problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
- The optimal approach highlights the importance of considering all possible swaps and keeping track of the minimum number of swaps required to make the sequences increasing up to each index.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering all possible swaps, which can lead to incorrect results.
- Not using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
- Not handling edge cases, such as sequences that are already increasing or have duplicate elements.
