## Elimination Game
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/elimination-game/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an integer `n`, representing the number of players in a circle.
- Expected output format: The output should be the position of the player who remains in the game after elimination.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The elimination process starts from the first player and moves in a specific direction. The direction of elimination alternates after each round.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `n = 5`, the elimination order would be `2, 4, 1, 3, 5`, resulting in the last player remaining at position `5`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Simulate the elimination process by iterating through the players and removing them according to the given rules.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a list of players from `1` to `n`.
  2. Start the elimination process from the first player and move in a specific direction.
  3. After each round, alternate the direction of elimination.
  4. Continue the process until only one player remains.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly simulates the problem statement and is easy to understand.

```cpp
vector<int> eliminationGame(int n) {
    vector<int> players(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        players[i] = i + 1;
    }
    bool direction = true; // true for left, false for right
    while (players.size() > 1) {
        if (direction) {
            players.erase(players.begin());
        } else {
            players.pop_back();
        }
        direction = !direction;
        if (!direction) {
            players.erase(players.begin() + (players.size() - 1) / 2);
        } else {
            players.erase(players.begin() + players.size() / 2);
        }
    }
    return players;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of players. This is because we are simulating the elimination process, which involves removing players one by one.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store the list of players.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The simulation of the elimination process requires iterating through the players and removing them, resulting in linear time complexity. The space complexity is also linear due to the need to store the list of players.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using a mathematical approach by observing the pattern of the elimination process. The last player remaining will always be the one at an odd position when counting from the left, starting with `1` as the first odd position.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the head of the remaining players to `1`.
  2. In each round, eliminate every other player, starting from the head.
  3. After each round, update the head to the next remaining player.
  4. Continue the process until only one player remains.
- Proof of optimality: This approach directly calculates the position of the last player remaining without simulating the entire elimination process, making it more efficient.

```cpp
int lastRemaining(int n) {
    int head = 1;
    int remaining = n;
    bool isForward = true;
    int step = 1;
    while (remaining > 1) {
        if (isForward || remaining % 2 == 1) {
            head = head + step;
        }
        remaining /= 2;
        step *= 2;
        isForward = !isForward;
    }
    return head;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(log n)$, where $n$ is the number of players. This is because we are reducing the number of remaining players by half in each round.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only need to store a constant amount of information.
> - **Optimality proof:** The mathematical approach directly calculates the position of the last player remaining, avoiding the need for simulation and resulting in logarithmic time complexity.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Simulation, mathematical modeling, and optimization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Looking for patterns in the elimination process and using mathematical insights to simplify the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding simulation by using mathematical approaches.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving elimination processes or patterns, such as Josephus problem variants.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly updating the head or remaining players in the optimal approach.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case when `n` is `1` or when the elimination process results in a single player remaining.
- Performance pitfalls: Using simulation for large inputs, which can lead to inefficient solutions.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the optimal approach with various inputs to ensure correctness.
