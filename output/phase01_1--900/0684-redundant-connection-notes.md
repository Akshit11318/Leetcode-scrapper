## Redundant Connection

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: `edges`, a list of edges in a graph, where each edge is represented as a pair of nodes `(u, v)`.
- Constraints: The graph is connected and has `n` nodes, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.
- Expected output format: The redundant connection in the graph, represented as a pair of nodes `(u, v)`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The graph may contain self-loops (edges from a node to itself) or parallel edges (multiple edges between the same pair of nodes).
  - The graph is not necessarily a tree, and may contain cycles.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]`: The redundant connection is `(2, 3)`, because the edge `(1, 2)` and `(1, 3)` already form a path between nodes `2` and `3`.
  - `edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]`: The redundant connection is `(3, 1)`, because the edges `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)` already form a path between nodes `3` and `1`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check every possible subset of edges to see if it forms a connected graph.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of edges.
  2. For each subset, check if the graph is connected by performing a depth-first search (DFS) from an arbitrary node.
  3. If the graph is connected, check if adding any of the remaining edges would form a cycle.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward way to check for redundancy, but it has exponential time complexity due to generating all possible subsets of edges.

```cpp
class UnionFind {
public:
    vector<int> parent;
    UnionFind(int n) : parent(n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    void union_(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
        }
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        UnionFind uf(n + 1);
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            if (uf.find(edge[0]) == uf.find(edge[1])) {
                return edge;
            }
            uf.union_(edge[0], edge[1]);
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \alpha(n))$, where $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the union-find operations, and the space complexity is due to storing the parent array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a union-find data structure to keep track of connected components in the graph.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a union-find data structure with $n$ nodes.
  2. Iterate through the edges and check if the two nodes are already in the same connected component.
  3. If they are, return the current edge as the redundant connection.
  4. Otherwise, merge the two nodes into the same connected component.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot \alpha(n))$, which is optimal for this problem because we need to iterate through all the edges.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        UnionFind uf(n + 1);
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            if (uf.find(edge[0]) == uf.find(edge[1])) {
                return edge;
            }
            uf.union_(edge[0], edge[1]);
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```
