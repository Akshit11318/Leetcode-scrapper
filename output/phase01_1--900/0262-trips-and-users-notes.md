## Trips and Users

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/trips-and-users/description

**Problem Statement:**
- The problem requires writing a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of trips based on the `Trips` and `Users` tables.
- The input format includes two tables: `Trips` and `Users`, with constraints on the data types and relationships between columns.
- The expected output format is the cancellation rate of trips.
- Key requirements include handling trips that are either completed or cancelled, and edge cases like trips with unknown or missing status.
- Example test cases are provided to demonstrate the expected output.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves joining the `Trips` and `Users` tables based on the `client_id` and `driver_id` columns.
- The next step is to filter trips based on the `status` column, which indicates whether a trip is completed or cancelled.
- We then calculate the cancellation rate by dividing the number of cancelled trips by the total number of trips.

```cpp
// SQL query to calculate cancellation rate
SELECT 
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN t.status LIKE 'cancelled%' THEN 1 END) * 1.0) / COUNT(*) AS cancellation_rate
FROM 
    Trips t
JOIN 
    Users c ON t.client_id = c.users_id
JOIN 
    Users d ON t.driver_id = d.users_id
WHERE 
    c.banned = 'No' AND d.banned = 'No'
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of rows in the `Trips` table, since we are scanning the table once to calculate the cancellation rate.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we are storing the results of the join operation in memory.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear due to the join operation, and the space complexity is also linear because we need to store the joined table in memory.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach involves using a similar SQL query to the brute force approach, but with some optimizations to improve performance.
- We use the same join operation to combine the `Trips` and `Users` tables, but we filter out banned users before joining the tables.
- We then calculate the cancellation rate using the same formula as the brute force approach.

```cpp
// Optimized SQL query to calculate cancellation rate
SELECT 
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN t.status LIKE 'cancelled%' THEN 1 END) * 1.0) / COUNT(*) AS cancellation_rate
FROM 
    Trips t
JOIN 
    Users c ON t.client_id = c.users_id AND c.banned = 'No'
JOIN 
    Users d ON t.driver_id = d.users_id AND d.banned = 'No'
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of rows in the `Trips` table, since we are scanning the table once to calculate the cancellation rate.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we are storing the results of the join operation in memory.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are using the minimum number of join operations required to filter out banned users and calculate the cancellation rate.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: join operations, filtering, and aggregation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using join operations to combine tables and filter out unwanted data.
- Optimization techniques learned: filtering out banned users before joining the tables to improve performance.
- Similar problems to practice: other SQL problems involving join operations and aggregation.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: forgetting to filter out banned users, incorrect join operations.
- Edge cases to watch for: trips with unknown or missing status, banned users.
- Performance pitfalls: using unnecessary join operations, not filtering out unwanted data.
- Testing considerations: testing the query with different input data, including edge cases.
