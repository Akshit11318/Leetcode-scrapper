## Stone Game

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer array `piles`, where `piles[i]` represents the number of stones in the `i-th` pile.
- Constraints: `2 <= piles.length <= 100`, `piles.length` is even, and `1 <= piles[i] <= 100`.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if Alex will win the game, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The game is played between two players, Alex and Lee.
  - The players take turns removing stones from the piles.
  - The player with the most stones at the end of the game wins.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `piles = [5,3,4,5]`: Alex will win the game because he can always make a move that will force Lee to take a smaller number of stones.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible moves for Alex and Lee, and determine the outcome of the game for each possible sequence of moves.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible sequences of moves for Alex and Lee.
  2. For each sequence of moves, calculate the total number of stones taken by Alex and Lee.
  3. Determine the winner of the game based on the total number of stones taken by each player.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that considers all possible outcomes of the game.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool stoneGame(vector<int>& piles) {
        int n = piles.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = piles[i];
        }
        for (int d = 1; d < n; d++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - d; i++) {
                int j = i + d;
                dp[i][j] = max(piles[i] - dp[i + 1][j], piles[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n - 1] > 0;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of piles. This is because we are using a dynamic programming approach to fill up a 2D table of size $n \times n$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of piles. This is because we are using a 2D table of size $n \times n$ to store the intermediate results.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time and space complexities occur because we are using a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The approach involves filling up a 2D table, which requires $O(n^2)$ time and space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The game is a zero-sum game, and Alex can always make a move that will force Lee to take a smaller number of stones.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Since the game is a zero-sum game, Alex can always make a move that will force Lee to take a smaller number of stones.
  2. This means that Alex can always win the game by making the optimal move at each step.
- Proof of optimality: The optimal approach is optimal because it guarantees a win for Alex, regardless of the moves made by Lee.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The optimal approach is already optimal, and further optimization is not possible.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool stoneGame(vector<int>& piles) {
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the optimal approach simply returns `true` without performing any calculations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the optimal approach does not use any additional space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach is optimal because it guarantees a win for Alex, regardless of the moves made by Lee.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, game theory.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, and the optimal approach can be found by analyzing the game theory behind the problem.
