## Groups of Special Equivalent Strings
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/groups-of-special-equivalent-strings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of strings `A` where each string consists only of lowercase English letters.
- Constraints: `1 <= A.length <= 1000`, `1 <= A[i].length <= 20`, and `A[i].length % 2 == 0`.
- Expected output format: The number of groups of special equivalent strings.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Two strings `A` and `B` are special equivalent if after any number of moves, by swapping even indexed characters within `A` or `B`, the strings become equal.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `["a","b","ab","caba","c"]`, Output: `3`. Explanation: Groups are `["a","c"]`, `["b"]`, and `["ab","caba"]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Compare each string with every other string, performing all possible swaps of even indexed characters to check for equivalence.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of even indexed characters for each string.
  2. Compare each string with every other string by checking if any permutation of the first string matches the second string.
  3. Group strings that are equivalent.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by exhaustively checking all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int numSpecialEquivGroups(vector<string>& A) {
    int count = 0;
    vector<bool> visited(A.size(), false);
    for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
        if (visited[i]) continue;
        count++;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < A.size(); j++) {
            if (visited[j]) continue;
            if (isSpecialEquiv(A[i], A[j])) {
                visited[j] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

bool isSpecialEquiv(const string& a, const string& b) {
    vector<char> evenA, oddA, evenB, oddB;
    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            evenA.push_back(a[i]);
            evenB.push_back(b[i]);
        } else {
            oddA.push_back(a[i]);
            oddB.push_back(b[i]);
        }
    }
    sort(evenA.begin(), evenA.end());
    sort(oddA.begin(), oddA.end());
    sort(evenB.begin(), evenB.end());
    sort(oddB.begin(), oddB.end());
    return evenA == evenB && oddA == oddB;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot m \log m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings and $m$ is the maximum length of a string. This is because for each pair of strings, we sort the characters at even and odd indices, which takes $O(m \log m)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, for storing the visited array and the temporary vectors for sorting.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves comparing each string with every other string and sorting characters within each string, leading to these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of comparing strings directly, we can create a signature for each string based on the sorted characters at even and odd indices. This allows us to group special equivalent strings efficiently.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. For each string, separate the characters at even and odd indices.
  2. Sort the characters at even and odd indices separately.
  3. Concatenate the sorted characters at even and odd indices to form a signature for the string.
  4. Use a set to store unique signatures, which represent groups of special equivalent strings.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it reduces the problem to creating a unique signature for each group of special equivalent strings, allowing us to count the groups in linear time after sorting.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

int numSpecialEquivGroups(vector<string>& A) {
    set<string> groups;
    for (const auto& s : A) {
        string signature;
        vector<char> even, odd;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                even.push_back(s[i]);
            } else {
                odd.push_back(s[i]);
            }
        }
        sort(even.begin(), even.end());
        sort(odd.begin(), odd.end());
        signature.append(even.begin(), even.end());
        signature.append(odd.begin(), odd.end());
        groups.insert(signature);
    }
    return groups.size();
}
```
