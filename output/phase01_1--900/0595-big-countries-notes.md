## Big Countries

**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/big-countries/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/big-countries/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A table `World` containing columns `name`, `continent`, and `area`.
- Constraints: The table may contain multiple rows for different countries.
- Expected output format: A table containing the names of countries that are either big (area > 3000) or have a population of at least 25000000.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling countries with null or missing values for area or population.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - A country with an area greater than 3000 should be included in the result.
  - A country with a population of at least 25000000 should be included in the result, regardless of its area.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over each row in the `World` table to check the conditions for area and population.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty result set.
  2. Iterate over each row in the `World` table.
  3. For each row, check if the area is greater than 3000 or the population is at least 25000000.
  4. If either condition is met, add the country name to the result set.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly implements the problem statement without considering optimization.

```cpp
SELECT name 
FROM World 
WHERE area > 3000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the table, because we are scanning the table once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, all countries could meet the criteria and be included in the result set.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves a linear scan of the table, resulting in linear time complexity. The space complexity is also linear because we need to store the result set.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same SQL query used in the brute force approach is already optimal for this problem because it directly selects the required data without any unnecessary operations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The query uses a simple `WHERE` clause to filter countries based on the given conditions.
- Proof of optimality: Since we must examine each row at least once to determine if it meets the criteria, the optimal time complexity is $O(n)$, which is achieved by the given SQL query.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Any solution must at least read the input, which requires $O(n)$ time, making the given SQL query optimal.

```cpp
SELECT name 
FROM World 
WHERE area > 3000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the table.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, all countries could meet the criteria.
> - **Optimality proof:** The query is optimal because it achieves the minimum required time complexity of $O(n)$ for scanning the table.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Linear scan, conditional filtering.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct implementation of problem statements can sometimes be optimal.
- Optimization techniques learned: Recognizing when a brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other SQL problems involving filtering and aggregation.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect use of `AND` and `OR` operators in the `WHERE` clause.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling null or missing values for area or population.
- Performance pitfalls: Unnecessary subqueries or joins that could increase the time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various input sizes and edge cases to verify the solution's correctness and performance.
