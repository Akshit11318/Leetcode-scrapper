## Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input will be a binary tree, and the task is to serialize it into a string and then deserialize it back into a binary tree. The binary tree is represented as a `TreeNode` class, where each node has a value and pointers to its left and right children.
- Expected output format: The output should be a binary tree that is identical to the original tree after serialization and deserialization.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The binary tree can be empty, and the serialization and deserialization processes should work correctly for all possible binary trees.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if the input binary tree is `1 / \ 2   3 / \ 4   5`, the serialized string could be `"1,2,4,X,X,5,X,X,3,X,X"`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The initial thought is to perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree and store the node values in a string. For deserialization, we can use a stack to reconstruct the binary tree.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Perform DFS traversal of the binary tree and store the node values in a string.
  2. Use a stack to deserialize the string and reconstruct the binary tree.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be the most efficient solution.

```cpp
class Codec {
public:
    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        string data;
        serializeHelper(root, data);
        return data;
    }
    
    void serializeHelper(TreeNode* node, string& data) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            data += "X,";
            return;
        }
        data += to_string(node->val) + ",";
        serializeHelper(node->left, data);
        serializeHelper(node->right, data);
    }
    
    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
        istringstream iss(data);
        string token;
        queue<string> tokens;
        while (getline(iss, token, ',')) {
            tokens.push(token);
        }
        return deserializeHelper(tokens);
    }
    
    TreeNode* deserializeHelper(queue<string>& tokens) {
        string token = tokens.front();
        tokens.pop();
        if (token == "X") {
            return nullptr;
        }
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(stoi(token));
        node->left = deserializeHelper(tokens);
        node->right = deserializeHelper(tokens);
        return node;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the binary tree, because we visit each node once during serialization and deserialization.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we store the serialized string and use a stack for deserialization.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we need to visit each node in the binary tree and store its value in the serialized string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a recursive approach with DFS traversal to serialize and deserialize the binary tree.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Perform DFS traversal of the binary tree and store the node values in a string.
  2. Use a recursive approach to deserialize the string and reconstruct the binary tree.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$ and a space complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible complexity for this problem.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we need to visit each node in the binary tree at least once to serialize and deserialize it.

```cpp
class Codec {
public:
    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        string data;
        serializeHelper(root, data);
        return data;
    }
    
    void serializeHelper(TreeNode* node, string& data) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            data += "X,";
            return;
        }
        data += to_string(node->val) + ",";
        serializeHelper(node->left, data);
        serializeHelper(node->right, data);
    }
    
    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
        istringstream iss(data);
        string token;
        vector<string> tokens;
        while (getline(iss, token, ',')) {
            tokens.push_back(token);
        }
        int index = 0;
        return deserializeHelper(tokens, index);
    }
    
    TreeNode* deserializeHelper(vector<string>& tokens, int& index) {
        string token = tokens[index++];
        if (token == "X") {
            return nullptr;
        }
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(stoi(token));
        node->left = deserializeHelper(tokens, index);
        node->right = deserializeHelper(tokens, index);
        return node;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: DFS traversal, recursive approach, and serialization/deserialization of binary trees.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a recursive approach to solve problems that involve tree traversals.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a recursive approach to reduce the space complexity of the solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve serialization and deserialization of data structures, such as graphs and linked lists.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling the case where the input tree is empty, or not properly implementing the recursive approach.
- Edge cases to watch for: The input tree can be empty, or it can have nodes with duplicate values.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a non-recursive approach that has a high space complexity, or not optimizing the solution for the given constraints.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input trees, including empty trees and trees with duplicate values.
