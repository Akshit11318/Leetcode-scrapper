## Construct the Rectangle
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an integer `area`, representing the area of a rectangle.
- Expected output format: The output should be an array of two integers, `[length, width]`, representing the dimensions of the rectangle with the minimum difference between `length` and `width`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: `1 <= area <= 10^4`, and the output should be the dimensions that minimize the difference between `length` and `width`.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - Input: `area = 4`
  - Output: `[2,2]`
  - Explanation: The area is 4, so the possible dimensions are `[1,4]` and `[2,2]`. The dimensions `[2,2]` have the minimum difference between `length` and `width`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through all possible combinations of `length` and `width` that multiply to `area`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Iterate through all numbers from `1` to `sqrt(area)`.
  2. For each number, check if it divides `area`.
  3. If it does, calculate the corresponding `width` and `length`.
  4. Keep track of the dimensions with the minimum difference between `length` and `width`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that checks all possible combinations of dimensions.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

vector<int> constructRectangle(int area) {
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;
    vector<int> result;
    for (int width = 1; width <= sqrt(area); width++) {
        if (area % width == 0) {
            int length = area / width;
            int diff = abs(length - width);
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                result = {length, width};
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\sqrt{area})$ because we are iterating up to the square root of `area`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are using a constant amount of space to store the result and the minimum difference.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating up to the square root of `area`, and the space complexity occurs because we are using a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Start from the square root of `area` and decrement the width until we find a divisor of `area`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Calculate the square root of `area`.
  2. Start from the square root and decrement the width until we find a divisor of `area`.
  3. Calculate the corresponding `length` and return the dimensions.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it starts from the square root of `area` and decrements the width until it finds a divisor, which ensures that the difference between `length` and `width` is minimized.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it finds the dimensions with the minimum difference between `length` and `width` in a single pass.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

vector<int> constructRectangle(int area) {
    int width = sqrt(area);
    while (width > 0) {
        if (area % width == 0) {
            return {area / width, width};
        }
        width--;
    }
    return {};
}
```

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, division, and optimization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Starting from the square root of a number and decrementing until a divisor is found.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minimizing the difference between two numbers by starting from the square root and decrementing.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the closest pair of numbers, finding the minimum difference between two numbers, etc.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for divisors, not decrementing the width correctly, etc.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `area` is a perfect square, when `area` is a prime number, etc.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using the square root as a starting point, iterating up to `area` instead of `sqrt(area)`, etc.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different inputs, testing with edge cases, etc.
