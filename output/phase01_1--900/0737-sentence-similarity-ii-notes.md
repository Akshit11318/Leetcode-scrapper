## Sentence Similarity II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, and a list of pairs of similar words `similarPairs`, determine if two sentences are similar. Similar sentences are sentences that contain the same words in the same order, but with the possibility of some words being replaced by their similar words.
- Expected output format: A boolean value indicating whether the two sentences are similar.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Two sentences are similar if the words in the same position are similar.
  - Two words are similar if they are in the `similarPairs` list.
  - The `similarPairs` list does not contain duplicate pairs.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: sentence1 = "great acting skills", sentence2 = "fine drama talent", similarPairs = [["great", "fine"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]]
    - Output: True
    - Explanation: The words in the same position are similar.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first step is to create a graph where each word is a node, and two nodes are connected if the corresponding words are similar.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a graph where each word is a node.
  2. Add edges between nodes if the corresponding words are similar.
  3. Use a depth-first search (DFS) to check if the words in the same position are similar.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that uses a graph to represent the relationships between words.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class UnionFind {
public:
    unordered_map<string, string> parent;
    unordered_map<string, int> rank;

    void make_set(const string& x) {
        parent[x] = x;
        rank[x] = 0;
    }

    string find(const string& x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    void union_set(const string& x, const string& y) {
        string root_x = find(x);
        string root_y = find(y);

        if (root_x != root_y) {
            if (rank[root_x] > rank[root_y]) {
                parent[root_y] = root_x;
            } else if (rank[root_x] < rank[root_y]) {
                parent[root_x] = root_y;
            } else {
                parent[root_y] = root_x;
                rank[root_x]++;
            }
        }
    }
};

bool areSentencesSimilarTwo(vector<string>& sentence1, vector<string>& sentence2, vector<vector<string>>& similarPairs) {
    if (sentence1.size() != sentence2.size()) return false;

    UnionFind uf;
    for (const auto& pair : similarPairs) {
        uf.make_set(pair[0]);
        uf.make_set(pair[1]);
        uf.union_set(pair[0], pair[1]);
    }

    for (const auto& word : sentence1) {
        uf.make_set(word);
    }

    for (const auto& word : sentence2) {
        uf.make_set(word);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < sentence1.size(); i++) {
        if (uf.find(sentence1[i]) != uf.find(sentence2[i])) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m \alpha(n))$, where $n$ is the total number of words in the sentences, $m$ is the number of similar pairs, and $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the total number of words in the sentences, and $m$ is the number of similar pairs.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the union-find operations, and the space complexity is due to the storage of the union-find data structure.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a union-find data structure to group similar words together.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a union-find data structure to group similar words together.
  2. Iterate through the sentences and check if the words in the same position are in the same group.
- Proof of optimality: The union-find data structure allows us to group similar words together in $O(n + m \alpha(n))$ time, and checking if two words are in the same group takes constant time.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The union-find data structure is the most efficient way to group similar words together, and checking if two words are in the same group takes constant time.

```cpp
// The code is the same as the brute force approach, as the optimal approach is also based on the union-find data structure.
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Union-find data structure, grouping similar words together.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a union-find data structure to group similar elements together.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using the union-find data structure to reduce the time complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve grouping similar elements together, such as finding connected components in a graph.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the union-find data structure correctly, not checking if two words are in the same group correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty sentences, sentences with no similar words.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a naive approach to group similar words together, not using the union-find data structure.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including empty sentences and sentences with no similar words.
