## Reverse String II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a string `s` and an integer `k`.
- Expected output format: The modified string after reversing every `2k` characters, starting from the `k-th` character.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the string.
  - Ensure the first `k` characters are reversed, then the next `k` characters are not reversed, and so on.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `s = "abcdefg", k = 2` should return `"bacdfeg"`.
  - `s = "abcd", k = 2` should return `"bacd"`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over the string and reverse every `2k` characters.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty string to store the result.
  2. Iterate over the input string, keeping track of the current index.
  3. When the index is within a `2k` block that should be reversed, reverse the characters in that block.
  4. Append the reversed (or not reversed) characters to the result string.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly implements the problem statement, but it may not be the most efficient.

```cpp
string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
    string result = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (i % (2 * k) < k) {
            // Find the start of the current block to be reversed
            int start = i - (i % (2 * k));
            // Reverse the characters in the block
            string block = s.substr(start, k);
            reverse(block.begin(), block.end());
            result += block;
            // Skip the characters that have been processed
            i += k - 1;
        } else {
            result += s[i];
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string, because we process each character once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the result string.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The iteration over the string and the creation of the result string dictate these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of reversing the string in-place or using a brute force approach, we can directly build the result string by iterating over the input string and reversing every `2k` characters.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty string to store the result.
  2. Iterate over the input string, keeping track of the current index.
  3. For every `2k` block, reverse the first `k` characters and append them to the result.
  4. For the remaining `k` characters in the `2k` block, append them as they are to the result.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a linear time complexity because it processes each character exactly once, which is the minimum required to solve the problem.

```cpp
string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
    string result = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 2 * k) {
        string block = s.substr(i, min(2 * k, (int)s.length() - i));
        string firstK = block.substr(0, min(k, (int)block.length()));
        reverse(firstK.begin(), firstK.end());
        result += firstK + block.substr(min(k, (int)block.length()));
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the result string.
> - **Optimality proof:** The linear time complexity is optimal because we must at least read the input string once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: String manipulation, iteration, and reversal.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (in this case, `2k` blocks).
- Optimization techniques learned: Directly building the result string instead of modifying the original string or using unnecessary data structures.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Off-by-one errors in indexing, incorrect handling of edge cases (e.g., when `k` is greater than the string length).
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling `k` values that are greater than the string length, ensuring the first `k` characters are correctly reversed.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures that lead to higher than necessary time or space complexities.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with various input strings and `k` values, including edge cases.
