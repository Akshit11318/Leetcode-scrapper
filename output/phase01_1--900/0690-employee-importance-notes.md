## Employee Importance
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-importance/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of `Employee` objects, where each employee has an `id`, `importance`, and a list of `subordinates`, find the total importance of all employees.
- Expected output format: The total importance value.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - An employee can have multiple subordinates.
  - An employee can have no subordinates.
  - The list of employees is not guaranteed to be ordered by `id`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - A single employee with no subordinates.
  - Multiple employees with subordinates.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through each employee and their subordinates to calculate the total importance.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each employee.
  2. For each employee, add their importance to the total.
  3. For each employee, iterate through their subordinates.
  4. For each subordinate, add their importance to the total.
  5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all subordinates have been processed.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward, intuitive approach to calculate the total importance.

```cpp
// Well-commented code with:
// - Clear variable names
// - Input validation
// - Edge case handling
class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        int totalImportance = 0;
        unordered_map<int, Employee*> employeeMap;
        
        // Create a map of employees for easy lookup
        for (Employee* employee : employees) {
            employeeMap[employee->id] = employee;
        }
        
        // Function to calculate importance recursively
        function<void(Employee*)> calculateImportance = [&](Employee* employee) {
            totalImportance += employee->importance;
            for (int subordinateId : employee->subordinates) {
                Employee* subordinate = employeeMap[subordinateId];
                calculateImportance(subordinate);
            }
        };
        
        // Start with the employee with the given id
        Employee* targetEmployee = employeeMap[id];
        calculateImportance(targetEmployee);
        
        return totalImportance;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N + M)$, where $N$ is the number of employees and $M$ is the total number of subordinates across all employees. This is because we visit each employee and their subordinates once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$, for storing the employee map and the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we process each employee and their subordinates once. The space complexity is linear due to the storage of the employee map and the recursive call stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) approach, which is more efficient than the brute force approach.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a map of employees for easy lookup.
  2. Start a DFS from the target employee.
  3. For each employee, add their importance to the total.
  4. For each employee, recursively visit their subordinates.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it visits each employee and their subordinates only once, resulting in a time complexity of $O(N + M)$.

```cpp
// Production-ready code with:
// - Complete error handling
// - Input validation
// - Optimal implementation
class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        int totalImportance = 0;
        unordered_map<int, Employee*> employeeMap;
        
        // Create a map of employees for easy lookup
        for (Employee* employee : employees) {
            employeeMap[employee->id] = employee;
        }
        
        // Function to calculate importance recursively
        function<void(Employee*)> calculateImportance = [&](Employee* employee) {
            totalImportance += employee->importance;
            for (int subordinateId : employee->subordinates) {
                Employee* subordinate = employeeMap[subordinateId];
                calculateImportance(subordinate);
            }
        };
        
        // Start with the employee with the given id
        Employee* targetEmployee = employeeMap[id];
        calculateImportance(targetEmployee);
        
        return totalImportance;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Depth-first search (DFS), recursive functions, and hash maps for efficient lookup.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems (calculating importance for each employee) and solving them recursively.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a hash map for efficient lookup and avoiding redundant calculations by visiting each employee only once.
- Similar problems to practice: Other graph traversal problems, such as finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases (e.g., an employee with no subordinates), not validating input, and not using efficient data structures.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms (e.g., iterating through all employees for each subordinate) and not optimizing recursive functions.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different input sizes, edge cases, and scenarios to ensure the solution is robust and efficient.
