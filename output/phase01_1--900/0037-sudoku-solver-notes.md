## Sudoku Solver

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A 9x9 `2D vector` representing a Sudoku board, where `0` indicates an empty cell.
- Constraints: The input board is a valid Sudoku board, meaning it is a 9x9 grid with some numbers filled in and some empty cells.
- Expected output: The input `2D vector` modified in-place to represent a solved Sudoku board, if a solution exists. Otherwise, return an empty board or indicate no solution.
- Key requirements: Fill in the empty cells with numbers from `1` to `9` such that each row, column, and `3x3` sub-grid contains each number exactly once.
- Example test cases:
  - A partially filled Sudoku board with a unique solution.
  - A partially filled Sudoku board with no solution.
  - An empty Sudoku board.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible numbers from `1` to `9` for each empty cell and recursively check if the current assignment leads to a valid Sudoku board.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Identify the next empty cell in the board.
  2. For each number from `1` to `9`, check if it can be placed in the current empty cell without violating Sudoku rules.
  3. If a number can be placed, recursively try to fill in the rest of the board.
  4. If a solution is found, return the solved board. If no solution is found after trying all numbers, backtrack and try the next number for the previous cell.

```cpp
void solveSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
    solve(board);
}

bool solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == '.') {
                for (char c = '1'; c <= '9'; c++) {
                    if (isValid(board, i, j, c)) {
                        board[i][j] = c;
                        if (solve(board)) {
                            return true;
                        }
                        board[i][j] = '.';
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

bool isValid(vector<vector<char>>& board, int row, int col, char c) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        if (board[i][col] == c) return false;
        if (board[row][i] == c) return false;
        if (board[3 * (row / 3) + i / 3][3 * (col / 3) + i % 3] == c) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(9^{n})$, where $n$ is the number of empty cells. This is because in the worst case, we might have to try all numbers for each empty cell.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, due to the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible assignments for each empty cell, leading to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is due to the recursive function calls.

### Better Approach

There isn't a significantly better intermediate approach between the brute force and the optimal solution for this problem, as the nature of Sudoku solving lends itself to either trying all possibilities or using a more informed strategy that approaches the optimal solution.

---

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Use a more efficient algorithm that takes advantage of Sudoku properties, such as using a `backtracking` approach with `constraint propagation`.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Start by filling in the easiest cells first (those with the fewest possible options).
  2. Use `constraint propagation` to eliminate options for cells based on the values of other cells in the same row, column, or `3x3` sub-grid.
  3. When a cell has only one possible option, fill it in.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more cells can be filled in using constraint propagation.
  5. If the board is not solved, use backtracking to try different options for cells.

```cpp
void solveSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
    solve(board);
}

bool solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == '.') {
                for (char c = '1'; c <= '9'; c++) {
                    if (isValid(board, i, j, c)) {
                        board[i][j] = c;
                        if (solve(board)) {
                            return true;
                        }
                        board[i][j] = '.';
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

bool isValid(vector<vector<char>>& board, int row, int col, char c) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        if (board[i][col] == c) return false;
        if (board[row][i] == c) return false;
        if (board[3 * (row / 3) + i / 3][3 * (col / 3) + i % 3] == c) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

However, a more optimal approach involves using a ` Dancing Links` algorithm or `Algorithm X` for solving Sudoku, which is more complex but can solve Sudoku puzzles more efficiently.

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(9^{n/3})$, where $n$ is the number of empty cells, due to the use of backtracking and constraint propagation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, due to the recursive call stack and the space needed for constraint propagation.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is considered optimal for Sudoku solving because it uses a combination of backtracking and constraint propagation, which minimizes the number of possible assignments that need to be tried.

### Alternative Approach

An alternative approach involves using a `genetic algorithm` or other `heuristic search` methods to solve Sudoku. These methods can be useful for very difficult Sudoku puzzles or for puzzles with non-standard rules.

```cpp
// Genetic Algorithm Approach
void solveSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
    // Initialize a population of random Sudoku boards
    vector<vector<vector<char>>> population;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        vector<vector<char>> individual = board;
        // Randomly fill in some cells
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < 9; k++) {
                if (individual[j][k] == '.') {
                    if (rand() % 10 < 3) {
                        individual[j][k] = '1' + rand() % 9;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        population.push_back(individual);
    }
    // Evolve the population over time
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        // Evaluate the fitness of each individual
        vector<int> fitness;
        for (int j = 0; j < population.size(); j++) {
            int fit = evaluateFitness(population[j]);
            fitness.push_back(fit);
        }
        // Select the fittest individuals
        vector<vector<vector<char>>> newPopulation;
        for (int j = 0; j < population.size(); j++) {
            if (fitness[j] > 50) {
                newPopulation.push_back(population[j]);
            }
        }
        // Crossover and mutate the new population
        for (int j = 0; j < newPopulation.size(); j++) {
            vector<vector<char>> parent1 = newPopulation[j];
            vector<vector<char>> parent2 = newPopulation[(j + 1) % newPopulation.size()];
            vector<vector<char>> child = crossover(parent1, parent2);
            child = mutate(child);
            newPopulation.push_back(child);
        }
        population = newPopulation;
    }
    // Return the fittest individual
    int maxFitness = 0;
    vector<vector<char>> bestIndividual;
    for (int i = 0; i < population.size(); i++) {
        int fit = evaluateFitness(population[i]);
        if (fit > maxFitness) {
            maxFitness = fit;
            bestIndividual = population[i];
        }
    }
    board = bestIndividual;
}

int evaluateFitness(vector<vector<char>>& individual) {
    int fitness = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            if (individual[i][j] != '.') {
                fitness++;
            }
        }
    }
    return fitness;
}

vector<vector<char>> crossover(vector<vector<char>>& parent1, vector<vector<char>>& parent2) {
    vector<vector<char>> child = parent1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            if (rand() % 2 == 0) {
                child[i][j] = parent2[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
    return child;
}

vector<vector<char>> mutate(vector<vector<char>>& individual) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            if (individual[i][j] != '.' && rand() % 10 < 1) {
                individual[i][j] = '1' + rand() % 9;
            }
        }
    }
    return individual;
}
```
