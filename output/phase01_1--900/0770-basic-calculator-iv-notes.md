## Basic Calculator IV
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-iv/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an expression `expression` containing numbers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and parentheses, evaluate it and return a list of strings representing the result of every possible evaluation of the expression.
- Expected output format: List of strings representing the results of every possible evaluation.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling parentheses to ensure correct order of operations.
  - Generating all possible results due to the presence of `+` and `-` operators.
  - Ensuring that the division operation is handled correctly, considering that it may result in non-integer values.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `"1+2*3"` should return `["7"]` because `1 + (2 * 3) = 7`.
  - `"1*(2*3)"` should return `["6"]` because `(1) * (2 * 3) = 6`.
  - `"2*(3+4)"` should return `["14"]` because `2 * (3 + 4) = 2 * 7 = 14`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To solve this problem, we can first generate all possible orders of operations by considering each `+` and `-` as a point where the order can change, and then evaluate the expression according to these different orders.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Parse the input expression into a format that can be processed, such as a tree or a stack-based representation.
  2. Identify all `+` and `-` operators in the expression, as these are the points where the order of operations can change.
  3. Generate all permutations of these operators, considering each permutation as a different order of operations.
  4. For each permutation, evaluate the expression according to the specified order of operations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the requirement of considering all possible evaluations of the expression by systematically changing the order of operations at each `+` and `-` operator.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Function to evaluate an expression
int evaluateExpression(const std::string& expression) {
    // Implement a basic calculator to evaluate the expression
    // This can be done using a stack-based approach or recursive descent parsing
    // For simplicity, assume we have a function that can evaluate a string expression
    // and returns the result as an integer.
}

// Function to generate all permutations of operators
void generatePermutations(std::vector<char>& operators, int start, int end) {
    if (start == end) {
        // Evaluate the expression with the current permutation of operators
        std::string expression = "1+2*3"; // Example expression
        int result = evaluateExpression(expression);
        std::cout << result << std::endl;
    } else {
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            std::swap(operators[start], operators[i]);
            generatePermutations(operators, start + 1, end);
            std::swap(operators[start], operators[i]); // Backtrack
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::string expression = "1+2*3";
    std::vector<char> operators = {'+'}; // Example operators
    generatePermutations(operators, 0, operators.size() - 1);
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of `+` and `-` operators, because we generate all permutations of these operators.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the operators and the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The exponential time complexity comes from generating all permutations of the operators, and the linear space complexity is due to the recursive call stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all permutations of the `+` and `-` operators, we can use a more efficient approach by considering the expression as a tree and evaluating it recursively.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Parse the input expression into a tree structure, where each node represents an operation or a number.
  2. Evaluate the expression by recursively traversing the tree and applying the operations.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it avoids the exponential time complexity of generating all permutations and instead uses a polynomial time complexity based on the size of the input expression.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Node structure for the expression tree
struct Node {
    std::string value;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};

// Function to create a new node
Node* newNode(const std::string& value) {
    Node* node = new Node();
    node->value = value;
    node->left = nullptr;
    node->right = nullptr;
    return node;
}

// Function to evaluate an expression tree
int evaluateTree(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return 0;
    }

    if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr) {
        // Leaf node, return the value
        return std::stoi(root->value);
    }

    int leftValue = evaluateTree(root->left);
    int rightValue = evaluateTree(root->right);

    // Apply the operation based on the node's value
    if (root->value == "+") {
        return leftValue + rightValue;
    } else if (root->value == "-") {
        return leftValue - rightValue;
    } else if (root->value == "*") {
        return leftValue * rightValue;
    } else if (root->value == "/") {
        return leftValue / rightValue;
    }

    return 0; // Default return value
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Node* root = newNode("+");
    root->left = newNode("1");
    root->right = newNode("2");

    int result = evaluateTree(root);
    std::cout << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the expression tree, because we recursively traverse the tree once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the nodes of the expression tree.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a polynomial time complexity based on the size of the input expression and avoids the exponential time complexity of generating all permutations.
