## Shortest Distance in a Plane
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-plane/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of points in a plane, where each point is represented by two integers `x` and `y`.
- Constraints: The number of points is between 2 and 10,000.
- Expected output format: The minimum distance between any two points in the plane.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Points can have the same x or y coordinates, and the minimum distance can be between any two points, not necessarily the closest pair in a specific order.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `points = [[1,1],[3,4]]`, Output: `2.8284271247461903` (distance between points (1,1) and (3,4)).
  - Example 2: Input: `points = [[1,1],[2,2]]`, Output: `1.4142135623730951` (distance between points (1,1) and (2,2)).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the distance between each pair of points and keep track of the minimum distance found.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each point in the array.
  2. For each point, iterate over every other point in the array.
  3. Calculate the Euclidean distance between the two points using the formula $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$.
  4. Update the minimum distance if the calculated distance is smaller.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward and intuitive method to calculate distances between all pairs of points.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>

double minDistance(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    double minDist = std::numeric_limits<double>::max();
    int n = points.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            double dist = std::sqrt(std::pow(points[j][0] - points[i][0], 2) + std::pow(points[j][1] - points[i][1], 2));
            minDist = std::min(minDist, dist);
        }
    }
    return minDist;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of points. This is because we have two nested loops that iterate over all points.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum distance and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is quadratic because we compare each point with every other point. The space complexity is constant because we don't use any data structures that grow with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal in terms of time complexity because we must compare each pair of points at least once to find the minimum distance.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same approach as the brute force, but with minor optimizations for readability and performance.
- Proof of optimality: Since we must check every pair of points, the minimum time complexity we can achieve is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of points.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Any algorithm that finds the minimum distance between any two points in a set must compare each pair of points, resulting in a time complexity of at least $O(n^2)$.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>

double minDistance(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    double minDist = std::numeric_limits<double>::max();
    int n = points.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            double dx = points[j][0] - points[i][0];
            double dy = points[j][1] - points[i][1];
            double dist = std::sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
            minDist = std::min(minDist, dist);
        }
    }
    return minDist;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of points.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because we must compare each pair of points to find the minimum distance. The space complexity is optimal because we don't use any data structures that grow with the input size.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Brute force approach, time and space complexity analysis.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The need to compare each pair of points to find the minimum distance.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minor optimizations for readability and performance, but no significant algorithmic improvements due to the nature of the problem.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving pairwise comparisons, such as finding the closest pair of points in a plane with a more efficient algorithm.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect calculation of distances, failure to update the minimum distance correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Points with the same x or y coordinates, duplicate points.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary data structures or algorithms that increase time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and large inputs to ensure correctness and performance.
