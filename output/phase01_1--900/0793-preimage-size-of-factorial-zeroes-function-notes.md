## Preimage Size of Factorial Zeroes Function

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/preimage-size-of-factorial-zeroes-function/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `K`, an integer representing the number of trailing zeros in a factorial.
- Output: The number of non-negative integers `x` such that `findZeroes(x)` equals `K`.
- Key requirements: Given `K`, determine how many numbers have `K` trailing zeros in their factorial.
- Example test cases: 
  - `findZeroes(3)` returns 5 because `5!` and `4!` both have 1 trailing zero, and there are no numbers that have exactly 3 trailing zeros.
  - `findZeroes(0)` returns 5 because numbers `0!`, `1!`, `2!`, `3!`, and `4!` all have 0 trailing zeros.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the factorial of each number and count the trailing zeros until we find `K` zeros.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Start from `0` and calculate the factorial of each number.
  2. For each factorial, count the trailing zeros.
  3. Stop when we reach a factorial with more than `K` trailing zeros and count how many numbers had exactly `K` trailing zeros.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly simulates the process described in the problem but is inefficient due to the large factorials and repeated calculations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int preimageSizeFZF(int K) {
        int count = 0;
        for (long long i = 0; i <= INT_MAX; i++) {
            if (findZeroes(i) == K) {
                count++;
            } else if (findZeroes(i) > K) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    int findZeroes(int x) {
        int count = 0;
        long long i = 5;
        while (x / i >= 1) {
            count += x / i;
            i *= 5;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ where $n$ is the input number, because for each number up to $n$, we calculate its factorial and count trailing zeros. However, this is an oversimplification since we actually stop once we exceed `K` zeros, and the number of operations is more closely related to the value of `K` itself.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we potentially calculate factorials for many numbers, and the space complexity is low because we only use a fixed amount of space to store our variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` (factorial of `n`) is determined by the number of factors of 5 in all the numbers up to `n`, because 2*5 = 10, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Use binary search to find the range of numbers that have `K` trailing zeros in their factorial.
  2. For a given `mid` in the binary search, calculate the number of trailing zeros in `mid!`.
  3. Adjust the search range based on whether `mid!` has more, less, or exactly `K` trailing zeros.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses binary search, reducing the search space significantly, and calculates the number of trailing zeros efficiently.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int preimageSizeFZF(int K) {
        if (K < 5) return 5;
        
        int left = K * 5, right = left * 5;
        
        while (left < right) {
            long long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (findZeroes(mid) < K) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return findZeroes(left) == K ? 5 : 0;
    }
    
    int findZeroes(int x) {
        int count = 0;
        long long i = 5;
        while (x / i >= 1) {
            count += x / i;
            i *= 5;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log K)$, because we use binary search to find the range of numbers with `K` trailing zeros, and each step in the binary search involves calculating the number of trailing zeros, which takes logarithmic time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because it minimizes the number of calculations needed to find the preimage size by leveraging the properties of factorials and binary search.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The key algorithmic concept demonstrated here is the use of binary search to efficiently find a target value within a large range.
- The problem-solving pattern identified involves leveraging mathematical properties (in this case, the relationship between factorials and trailing zeros) to simplify the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned include reducing the search space through binary search and using mathematical insights to avoid unnecessary calculations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- A common implementation error is not properly handling the edge cases or not correctly implementing the binary search.
- Performance pitfalls include not optimizing the calculation of trailing zeros and not using binary search to reduce the search space.
- Testing considerations include ensuring the solution works correctly for edge cases (like `K=0`) and large inputs.
