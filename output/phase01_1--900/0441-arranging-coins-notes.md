## Arranging Coins
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of coins to arrange. The constraints are $1 \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1$.
- Expected output format: The output should be the number of complete rows that can be formed using the given coins.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The arrangement of coins follows a pattern where each row contains one more coin than the previous row. The goal is to find the maximum number of rows that can be completely filled with the given coins.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `n = 5`
    - Output: `2`
    - Explanation: The first row contains 1 coin, and the second row contains 2 coins, leaving 2 coins unused. Thus, only 2 rows can be completely filled.
  - Input: `n = 8`
    - Output: `3`
    - Explanation: The arrangement would be 1 coin in the first row, 2 coins in the second row, and 3 coins in the third row, with 2 coins remaining. Hence, 3 rows can be completely filled.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Start by filling the rows one by one, keeping track of the number of coins used and the number of rows filled.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize variables to track the number of rows and the remaining coins.
  2. Iterate through the rows, calculating the number of coins needed for each row.
  3. Check if there are enough coins to fill the current row. If yes, increment the row count and subtract the coins used from the total.
  4. Repeat until there are not enough coins to fill the next row.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly simulates the process of arranging coins row by row, making it an intuitive initial solution.

```cpp
int arrangeCoins(int n) {
    int rows = 0;
    int coinsUsed = 0;
    int rowLength = 1;
    while (coinsUsed + rowLength <= n) {
        coinsUsed += rowLength;
        rows++;
        rowLength++;
    }
    return rows;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\sqrt{n})$, because in the worst case, the number of iterations is proportional to the square root of the number of coins, as each row adds one more coin than the previous.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since only a constant amount of space is used to store the variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the iterative process of filling rows, which stops when there are not enough coins to fill the next row. The space complexity is constant because the space used does not grow with the size of the input.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Recognize that the problem can be solved using a mathematical formula. The total number of coins used to fill `k` rows is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}$.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: We need to find the largest `k` such that $\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \leq n$. This can be rearranged into a quadratic inequality: $k^2 + k - 2n \leq 0$.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the maximum number of rows without the need for iteration, reducing the time complexity to constant time.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The problem requires finding the maximum number of rows, which is inherently tied to the quadratic relationship between the number of rows and the total coins. Thus, solving the inequality is the most efficient way to find the solution.

```cpp
int arrangeCoins(int n) {
    return (int)((sqrt(8.0 * n + 1) - 1) / 2);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the solution involves a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, for the same reason as the brute force approach.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is constant because the calculation involves only a fixed number of arithmetic operations, making it the most efficient solution possible for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The use of mathematical formulas to solve problems, specifically the sum of an arithmetic series and solving quadratic inequalities.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Recognizing when a problem can be reduced to a mathematical formula, allowing for a more efficient solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Direct calculation can often be more efficient than iterative approaches, especially when a problem has a clear mathematical structure.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving arithmetic series, quadratic equations, or optimization through mathematical modeling.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly solving the quadratic inequality or misapplying the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring that the solution handles the boundary conditions correctly, such as when `n` is 1 or when `n` is very large.
- Performance pitfalls: Failing to recognize the potential for a constant-time solution and instead opting for an iterative approach.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with a range of inputs, including small and large values of `n`, to ensure correctness.
