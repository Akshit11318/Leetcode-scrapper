## Count and Say

**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `n` representing the term in the sequence to generate.
- Constraints: $1 \leq n \leq 30$
- Expected output: A string representing the `n`-th term in the sequence.
- Key requirements: The sequence starts with "1". Each subsequent term is generated by describing the previous term. For example, the sequence begins as "1", "11" (one 1), "21" (two 1s), "1211" (one 2, then one 1), and so on.
- Example test cases: 
  - Input: `n = 1`
  - Output: `"1"`
  - Explanation: The first term is "1".
  - Input: `n = 4`
  - Output: `"1211"`
  - Explanation: The sequence is "1", "11", "21", "1211".

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves understanding the sequence generation rule and applying it iteratively.
- We start with the first term "1" and then generate each subsequent term by counting and saying the digits of the previous term.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly implements the problem's description.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        string result = "1";
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            string next;
            int count = 1;
            for (int j = 1; j <= result.size(); j++) {
                if (j == result.size() || result[j] != result[j-1]) {
                    next += to_string(count) + result[j-1];
                    count = 1;
                } else {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            result = next;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the input number and $m$ is the maximum length of the sequence string. This is because in the worst case, we might have to iterate through each character of the sequence string $n$ times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the maximum length of the sequence string. This is because we need to store the current and next sequence strings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are generating the sequence iteratively and storing the current and next terms in memory.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach is essentially the same as the brute force approach because the problem inherently requires generating the sequence iteratively based on the description of the previous term.
- The key insight is recognizing that there's no significant shortcut to generating the sequence other than following the problem's description closely.
- This approach is optimal because it directly implements the required generation rule without any unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        string result = "1";
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            string next;
            int count = 1;
            for (int j = 1; j <= result.size(); j++) {
                if (j == result.size() || result[j] != result[j-1]) {
                    next += to_string(count) + result[j-1];
                    count = 1;
                } else {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            result = next;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the input number and $m$ is the maximum length of the sequence string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the maximum length of the sequence string.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because it directly implements the problem's requirements without any unnecessary steps or data structures, achieving the minimum time and space complexity required to solve the problem.
