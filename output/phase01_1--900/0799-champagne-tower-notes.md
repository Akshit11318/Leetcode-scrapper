## Champagne Tower
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/champagne-tower/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: We are given three integers: `poured`, `query_row`, and `query_glass`. `poured` represents the amount of champagne poured into the first glass, `query_row` and `query_glass` represent the row and glass we are interested in.
- Expected output format: The expected output is the amount of champagne in the `query_glass` at the `query_row`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: We need to consider the case when the `query_row` is 0, and when the amount of champagne in the glass is less than 1.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `poured = 1`, `query_row = 1`, `query_glass = 1`, Output: `0`. Explanation: The first glass has 1 unit of champagne, and the second glass has 0 units of champagne.
  - Example 2: Input: `poured = 2`, `query_row = 1`, `query_glass = 1`, Output: `0.5`. Explanation: The first glass has 2 units of champagne, and the second glass has 0.5 units of champagne.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can simulate the pouring process for each row and calculate the amount of champagne in each glass.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize a 2D array to store the amount of champagne in each glass.
  2. For each row, calculate the amount of champagne in each glass based on the amount of champagne in the glasses above it.
  3. If the amount of champagne in a glass is greater than 1, pour the excess champagne into the glasses below it.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is intuitive because it simulates the real-world scenario of pouring champagne into glasses.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

double champagneTower(int poured, int query_row, int query_glass) {
    std::vector<std::vector<double>> tower(query_row + 1, std::vector<double>(query_row + 1, 0));
    tower[0][0] = poured;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < query_row; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            if (tower[i][j] > 1) {
                double excess = (tower[i][j] - 1) / 2;
                tower[i + 1][j] += excess;
                tower[i + 1][j + 1] += excess;
                tower[i][j] = 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return std::min(1.0, tower[query_row][query_glass]);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the `query_row`. This is because we have a nested loop that iterates over each row and each glass in the row.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the `query_row`. This is because we need a 2D array to store the amount of champagne in each glass.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time and space complexities occur because we need to simulate the pouring process for each row and store the amount of champagne in each glass.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to store the amount of champagne in each glass and avoid redundant calculations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a 2D array to store the amount of champagne in each glass.
  2. For each row, calculate the amount of champagne in each glass based on the amount of champagne in the glasses above it.
  3. If the amount of champagne in a glass is greater than 1, pour the excess champagne into the glasses below it.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we need to simulate the pouring process for each row and store the amount of champagne in each glass.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

double champagneTower(int poured, int query_row, int query_glass) {
    std::vector<std::vector<double>> dp(query_row + 1, std::vector<double>(query_row + 1, 0));
    dp[0][0] = poured;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < query_row; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            double excess = (dp[i][j] - 1) / 2;
            if (excess > 0) {
                dp[i + 1][j] += excess;
                dp[i + 1][j + 1] += excess;
            }
            dp[i][j] = std::min(1.0, dp[i][j]);
        }
    }
    
    return std::min(1.0, dp[query_row][query_glass]);
}
```

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as when the `query_row` is 0.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case when the `query_row` is 0, and when the amount of champagne in the glass is less than 1.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different inputs, such as different values of `poured`, `query_row`, and `query_glass`.
