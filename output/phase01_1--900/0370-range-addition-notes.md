## Range Addition

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves adding a value to all elements in a given range in an array. The input consists of the length of the array (`length`), the number of operations (`m`), and an array of operations (`operations`) where each operation is an array of three integers: the start index (`start`), the end index (`end`), and the value to add (`val`).
- Expected output format: The modified array after all operations have been applied.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array indices are 0-based, and the operations should be performed in the order they appear in the `operations` array. The start index is inclusive, and the end index is exclusive.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `length = 5`, `m = 2`, `operations = [[1, 3, 2], [2, 4, 3]]`: The result should be `[0, 2, 5, 6, 0]`.
  - `length = 3`, `m = 2`, `operations = [[1, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3]]`: The result should be `[0, 2, 3]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The straightforward approach is to iterate through each operation and update the corresponding range in the array by adding the specified value.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an array of zeros with the given length.
  2. For each operation, iterate from the start index to the end index (exclusive) and add the specified value to each element.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly implements the problem statement without considering any optimizations.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> getModifiedArray(int length, vector<vector<int>>& operations) {
    vector<int> result(length, 0);
    for (const auto& op : operations) {
        int start = op[0], end = op[1], val = op[2];
        for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
            result[i] += val;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$ where $m$ is the number of operations and $n$ is the average length of the ranges in the operations. In the worst case, $n$ could be as large as `length`, leading to $O(m \cdot length)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(length)$ for storing the result array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the nested loops over the operations and the ranges within those operations. The space complexity is because we need to store the modified array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of updating the array for each operation, we can use a technique similar to prefix sums or difference arrays. We only update the start and end indices of each operation, adding the value at the start index and subtracting it at the end index (if within bounds). Then, we calculate the prefix sum of the resulting array to get the final modified array.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an array of zeros with the given length.
  2. For each operation, add the value at the start index and subtract it at the end index (if within bounds).
  3. Calculate the prefix sum of the resulting array.
- Proof of optimality: This approach reduces the time complexity to $O(m + length)$ because we only iterate through the operations once and then through the array once to calculate the prefix sum.

```cpp
vector<int> getModifiedArray(int length, vector<vector<int>>& operations) {
    vector<int> result(length + 1, 0); // Extra space for easier prefix sum calculation
    for (const auto& op : operations) {
        int start = op[0], end = op[1], val = op[2];
        result[start] += val;
        if (end < length) {
            result[end] -= val;
        }
    }
    // Calculate prefix sum
    for (int i = 1; i < length; ++i) {
        result[i] += result[i - 1];
    }
    result.resize(length); // Remove the extra element
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m + length)$ where $m$ is the number of operations and $length$ is the length of the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(length)$ for storing the result array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we must at least read the input operations and produce the output array, resulting in a lower bound of $O(m + length)$.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Difference arrays or prefix sums for efficient range updates.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Reducing the problem to a series of simpler operations (prefix sum calculation) can significantly improve efficiency.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary iterations and using mathematical properties (like the prefix sum) to simplify computations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other range update or query problems that can benefit from prefix sum or difference array techniques.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling edge cases (like the end index of operations or the bounds of the array).
- Edge cases to watch for: Operations with start or end indices at the boundaries of the array, or operations with zero value.
- Performance pitfalls: Using brute force approaches for range updates without considering optimizations like prefix sums.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with various operation sets, including empty operations, operations that cover the entire array, and operations with negative values or values of zero.
