## Sum of Two Integers
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, with the constraint that the sum of the two integers should be calculated without using the arithmetic operators `+` and `-`.
- Expected output format: The output should be the sum of the two input integers.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The solution should handle both positive and negative integers, as well as the case where one or both of the input integers are zero.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `a = 1, b = 2`, expected output: `3`
  - `a = -2, b = 3`, expected output: `1`
  - `a = 0, b = 0`, expected output: `0`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves using a loop to repeatedly add `1` to `a` for `b` times. However, this approach is inefficient and does not meet the constraint of not using arithmetic operators `+` and `-`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `result` to `a`.
  2. Loop `b` times, adding `1` to `result` in each iteration.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward but does not meet the problem's constraints.

```cpp
int getSum(int a, int b) {
    int result = a;
    for (int i = 0; i < abs(b); i++) {
        if (b > 0) {
            // Simulate addition by incrementing result
            result++;
        } else {
            // Simulate subtraction by decrementing result
            result--;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(b)$, where $b$ is the absolute value of the second integer. This is because in the worst case, we loop $b$ times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the result and loop counter.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear with respect to $b$ because we perform a constant amount of work for each iteration of the loop. The space complexity is constant because we do not allocate any additional space that scales with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use bitwise operations to add two numbers without using the arithmetic operators `+` and `-`. The idea is to use bitwise XOR (`^`) to add the two numbers without considering the carry, and then use bitwise AND (`&`) to calculate the carry. We repeat this process until there is no carry.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the sum of `a` and `b` without considering the carry using `a ^ b`.
  2. Calculate the carry using `(a & b) << 1`.
  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there is no carry.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it avoids the use of arithmetic operators `+` and `-` and only uses bitwise operations, which are more efficient.

```cpp
int getSum(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int carry = a & b;
        a = a ^ b;
        b = carry << 1;
    }
    return a;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(log(max(a, b)))$, where $max(a, b)$ is the maximum of the absolute values of `a` and `b`. This is because in the worst case, we repeat the process until there is no carry, which takes logarithmic time with respect to the maximum of the absolute values of `a` and `b`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the result and carry.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses bitwise operations to add two numbers without using arithmetic operators `+` and `-`, and it does so in logarithmic time with respect to the maximum of the absolute values of `a` and `b`.
