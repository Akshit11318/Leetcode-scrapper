## Remove Boxes
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-boxes/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-boxes/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: a list of integers representing the colors of the boxes.
- Constraints: 1 <= boxes.length <= 100.
- Expected output format: the maximum number of points that can be obtained.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: the points obtained by removing a group of boxes of the same color are calculated as the square of the number of boxes in the group.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: boxes = [1,1]
  - Output: 4
  - Explanation: We can remove the two boxes of the same color, so we obtain 2^2 = 4 points.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: try all possible combinations of removing boxes.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of removing boxes.
  2. For each combination, calculate the points obtained.
  3. Return the maximum points obtained.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: it is a straightforward approach, but it is not efficient due to the large number of combinations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeBoxes(vector<int>& boxes) {
        int n = boxes.size();
        int maxPoints = 0;
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            vector<int> group;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    group.push_back(boxes[i]);
                }
            }
            int points = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < group.size(); i++) {
                int count = 1;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < group.size(); j++) {
                    if (group[i] == group[j]) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                points += count * count;
            }
            maxPoints = max(maxPoints, points);
        }
        return maxPoints;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of boxes. The reason is that we generate all possible combinations of removing boxes, and for each combination, we calculate the points obtained by iterating over the boxes.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of boxes. The reason is that we store the current combination of removing boxes.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** the brute force approach has an exponential time complexity due to the large number of combinations, and a linear space complexity due to the storage of the current combination.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: use dynamic programming to store the maximum points obtained for each subproblem.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Define a 3D array `dp` where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the maximum points obtained by removing the boxes from index `i` to `j` with `k` boxes of the same color to the left of `i`.
  2. Initialize the `dp` array with base cases.
  3. Fill the `dp` array using the following recurrence relation: `dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i][j][k], (j - i + 1) * (j - i + 1) + dp[i + 1][j][0])`.
  4. Return the maximum points obtained by removing all boxes, which is stored in `dp[0][n - 1][0]`.
- Proof of optimality: the dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of removing boxes and store the maximum points obtained for each subproblem, which leads to the optimal solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeBoxes(vector<int>& boxes) {
        int n = boxes.size();
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(n)));
        function<int(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int i, int j, int k) {
            if (i > j) return 0;
            if (dp[i][j][k] != 0) return dp[i][j][k];
            int maxPoints = (j - i + 1) * (j - i + 1) + dfs(i + 1, j, 0);
            for (int mid = i + 1; mid <= j; mid++) {
                if (boxes[i] == boxes[mid]) {
                    maxPoints = max(maxPoints, dfs(i + 1, mid - 1, 0) + dfs(mid, j, k + 1));
                }
            }
            return dp[i][j][k] = maxPoints;
        };
        return dfs(0, n - 1, 0);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of boxes. The reason is that we use a 3D array to store the maximum points obtained for each subproblem, and we fill the array using a recurrence relation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of boxes. The reason is that we store the maximum points obtained for each subproblem in a 3D array.
> - **Optimality proof:** the dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of removing boxes and store the maximum points obtained for each subproblem, which leads to the optimal solution.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: dynamic programming, recurrence relation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, using a 3D array to store the maximum points obtained for each subproblem.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a recurrence relation to fill the `dp` array, storing the maximum points obtained for each subproblem to avoid redundant calculations.
- Similar problems to practice: problems that involve dynamic programming, recurrence relation, and optimization techniques.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not initializing the `dp` array correctly, not filling the `dp` array using the correct recurrence relation.
- Edge cases to watch for: handling the base cases correctly, handling the case where there are no boxes to remove.
- Performance pitfalls: not using dynamic programming to store the maximum points obtained for each subproblem, not using a recurrence relation to fill the `dp` array.
- Testing considerations: testing the solution with different inputs, testing the solution with edge cases.
