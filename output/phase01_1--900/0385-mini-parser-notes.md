## Mini Parser

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/mini-parser/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a string `s` representing a nested list. Each element in the list can be an integer or a nested list.
- Expected output format: Return the deserialized version of the input string.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle nested lists of arbitrary depth and integers within these lists.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `s = "[123,[456,[789]]]"`, Output: `[123,[456,[789]]]`
  - Input: `s = "324"`, Output: `324`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Parse the string character by character, using a stack to track the opening and closing brackets, and handling integers and nested lists accordingly.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty stack to store the intermediate results.
  2. Iterate over the string character by character.
  3. When encountering an opening bracket `[`, push a new list onto the stack.
  4. When encountering a digit, parse the integer and append it to the current list on the stack.
  5. When encountering a comma `,`, do nothing as it's a separator.
  6. When encountering a closing bracket `]`, pop the last list from the stack and append it to the list above it (if any).
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the structure of the input string and handles the nesting and integer parsing in a straightforward manner.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    NestedInteger deserialize(string s) {
        if (s[0] != '[') {
            return NestedInteger(stoi(s));
        }
        
        NestedInteger res;
        int start = 1, count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '[') count++;
            else if (s[i] == ']') count--;
            else if (s[i] == ',' && count == 0) {
                NestedInteger ni = deserialize(s.substr(start, i - start));
                res.add(ni);
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }
        
        if (start < s.size() - 1) {
            NestedInteger ni = deserialize(s.substr(start, s.size() - start - 1));
            res.add(ni);
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string, because we are scanning the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, due to the recursive call stack and the storage of the intermediate results.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we process each character in the string once. The space complexity is also linear due to the recursive nature of parsing nested lists and the storage required for the intermediate results.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Utilizing a stack-based approach to directly parse the string into the desired nested integer structure without unnecessary recursive calls.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty stack to store `NestedInteger` objects.
  2. Iterate over the string, handling each character type (digit, `[`, `]`, `,`) to build the nested structure.
  3. When a digit is encountered, accumulate the digits until a non-digit character is found, then create a `NestedInteger` with the integer value.
  4. When `[` is encountered, push a new `NestedInteger` onto the stack to start a new list.
  5. When `]` is encountered, pop the last `NestedInteger` from the stack, and if the stack is not empty, add it to the top `NestedInteger` on the stack.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the input string and uses a stack to efficiently manage the nested structure, resulting in linear time and space complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    NestedInteger deserialize(string s) {
        if (s[0] != '[') {
            return NestedInteger(stoi(s));
        }
        
        NestedInteger res;
        stack<NestedInteger> st;
        st.push(res);
        int num = 0;
        bool negative = false;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '-') {
                negative = true;
            } else if (isdigit(c)) {
                num = num * 10 + (c - '0');
            } else if (c == '[') {
                NestedInteger newNI;
                st.push(newNI);
            } else if (c == ']') {
                if (num != 0) {
                    st.top().add(NestedInteger(negative ? -num : num));
                    num = 0;
                    negative = false;
                }
                NestedInteger ni = st.top();
                st.pop();
                if (!st.empty()) {
                    st.top().add(ni);
                } else {
                    return ni;
                }
            } else if (c == ',') {
                if (num != 0) {
                    st.top().add(NestedInteger(negative ? -num : num));
                    num = 0;
                    negative = false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Stack-based parsing, recursive and iterative parsing techniques.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Handling nested structures through recursion or iterative stack-based approaches.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing recursive calls and using iterative methods when possible.
- Similar problems to practice: Other parsing problems, such as parsing JSON or XML strings into structured data.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect handling of edge cases (e.g., empty string, single-element list), incorrect parsing of integers.
- Edge cases to watch for: Nested lists of varying depths, lists containing both integers and nested lists.
- Performance pitfalls: Using overly recursive solutions that lead to stack overflow errors for deeply nested inputs.
- Testing considerations: Ensure thorough testing with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and deeply nested structures.
