## Reverse Nodes in k-Group

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: The problem takes the head of a linked list and an integer `k` as input.
- Constraints: `1 <= k <= n`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Expected output format: The function should return the head of the modified linked list.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - If `k` is greater than the number of remaining nodes, the nodes should remain in their original order.
  - The function should handle cases where the input linked list is empty or contains only one node.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 2`
    - Output: `[2,1,4,3,5]`
  - Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 3`
    - Output: `[3,2,1,4,5]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Reverse the linked list `k` nodes at a time.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a dummy node to simplify edge cases.
  2. Initialize a pointer to the current node.
  3. While the current node is not `nullptr`, check if there are at least `k` nodes remaining.
  4. If there are at least `k` nodes, reverse the next `k` nodes.
  5. Move the pointer to the `k`-th node from the current node.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
// Brute force approach
ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
    ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy->next = head;
    ListNode* pre = dummy;
    ListNode* cur = head;
    
    while (cur) {
        ListNode* tail = cur;
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            if (!tail->next) {
                return dummy->next;
            }
            tail = tail->next;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            ListNode* temp = cur->next;
            cur->next = temp->next;
            temp->next = pre->next;
            pre->next = temp;
        }
        
        pre = cur;
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    
    return dummy->next;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we visit each node once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space required for the output. This is because we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a constant amount of work for each node. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the dummy node and other pointers.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal in terms of time complexity.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: We can simplify the code by removing unnecessary operations.
- Proof of optimality: The time complexity of $O(n)$ is optimal because we must visit each node at least once to reverse the linked list.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We cannot improve the time complexity because we must perform a constant amount of work for each node.

```cpp
// Optimal approach
ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
    ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy->next = head;
    ListNode* pre = dummy;
    ListNode* cur = head;
    
    while (cur) {
        ListNode* tail = cur;
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            if (!tail->next) {
                return dummy->next;
            }
            tail = tail->next;
        }
        
        ListNode* next = tail->next;
        ListNode* prev = cur;
        ListNode* p = cur->next;
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            ListNode* temp = p->next;
            p->next = prev;
            prev = p;
            p = temp;
        }
        
        tail->next = nullptr;
        cur->next = next;
        pre->next = prev;
        pre = cur;
        cur = next;
    }
    
    return dummy->next;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Reversing a linked list, using a dummy node to simplify edge cases.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems, using a brute force approach to find an optimal solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Simplifying code, removing unnecessary operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Reversing a linked list, merging two sorted linked lists.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, not handling `nullptr` correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty linked list, linked list with only one node, `k` greater than the number of nodes.
- Performance pitfalls: Using excessive memory, performing unnecessary operations.
- Testing considerations: Test with different input sizes, test with different values of `k`.
