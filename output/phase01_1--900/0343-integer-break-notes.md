## Integer Break

**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `n` where `2 <= n <= 58`.
- Constraints: The input is a single integer.
- Expected Output: The maximum product of the factors of `n` after breaking it into at least two factors.
- Key Requirements: Find the optimal way to break `n` into factors that maximize the product of these factors.
- Example Test Cases:
  - For `n = 2`, the maximum product is `1` because the only way to break `2` is into `1` and `1`.
  - For `n = 10`, the maximum product is `36` because `10` can be broken into `3` and `3` and `4`, but the optimal way is to break it into `3` and `3` and `4` is not optimal, instead, we break it into `3` and `3` and `4` is not optimal, the optimal is `3 * 3 = 9` and `4` is not part of the optimal, the optimal is `3 * 3 = 9` and `4` is `4`, the optimal is `4 = 2 * 2`, so `10 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 36`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of breaking `n` into factors and calculate the product for each combination.
- The brute force approach involves generating all possible factor combinations of `n`, calculating the product of each combination, and keeping track of the maximum product found.
- This approach comes to mind first because it's straightforward and ensures that all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int integerBreak(int n) {
        int maxProduct = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int product = i;
            int remaining = n - i;
            for (int j = 1; j <= remaining; j++) {
                int tempProduct = i;
                int tempRemaining = remaining;
                tempProduct *= j;
                tempRemaining -= j;
                while (tempRemaining > 0) {
                    for (int k = 1; k <= tempRemaining; k++) {
                        int newProduct = tempProduct;
                        newProduct *= k;
                        int newRemaining = tempRemaining - k;
                        if (newRemaining == 0) {
                            maxProduct = max(maxProduct, newProduct);
                        } else {
                            tempProduct = newProduct;
                            tempRemaining = newRemaining;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return maxProduct;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^{n-1})$ because in the worst case, we're trying all possible factor combinations of `n`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we're only using a constant amount of space to store the maximum product and temporary variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is highly inefficient due to its exponential time complexity, which makes it impractical for large inputs.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is recognizing that the maximum product can be achieved by breaking `n` into as many `3`s as possible, with a `2` or `4` left over if necessary.
- This is because `3` is the optimal factor that maximizes the product when breaking `n` into more than one factor.
- The proof of optimality can be understood by considering the properties of exponentiation and how the product of factors grows as the base factor increases.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int integerBreak(int n) {
        if (n == 2) return 1;
        if (n == 3) return 2;
        int product = 1;
        while (n > 4) {
            product *= 3;
            n -= 3;
        }
        product *= n;
        return product;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ because we're iterating through `n` to break it down into factors of `3` and a remaining factor if any.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we're only using a constant amount of space to store the product and temporary variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it ensures that `n` is broken down into the optimal number of `3`s and a remaining factor, which maximizes the product according to the properties of exponentiation.
