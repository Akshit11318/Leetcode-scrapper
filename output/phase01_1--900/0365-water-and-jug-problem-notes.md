## Water and Jug Problem
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/water-and-jug-problem/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two integers `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity` representing the capacities of two jugs.
- Constraints: `0 <= jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity <= 10^6`.
- Expected output format: `true` if it's possible to measure `targetCapacity` liters of water, `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements: Determine if it's possible to measure a certain amount of water using two jugs with different capacities.
- Example test cases:
  - `jug1Capacity = 3`, `jug2Capacity = 5`, `targetCapacity = 4` -> `true` (fill `jug1` to 3, pour into `jug2` to get 3 in `jug2`, empty `jug1`, fill `jug1` to 3, pour 2 from `jug1` into `jug2` to get
