## Optimal Division
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-division/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given an array of integers `nums` with at least two elements, we want to divide these numbers in a way that the final result is the maximum possible.
- Constraints: `2 <= nums.length <= 10`, and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.
- Expected output format: The maximum possible result after dividing all numbers in the array.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: We need to find the optimal way to divide these numbers to maximize the final result.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = [1000, 100, 10, 2]`, the maximum result is `1000 / 100 / 10 / 2 = 0.5`.
  - For `nums = [4, 3, 2]`, the maximum result is `4 / (3 / 2) = 8 / 3`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible ways to divide the numbers and find the maximum result.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: We can use recursion to try all possible divisions.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to solve the problem, but it's not efficient.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double optimalDivision(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        double maxResult = -1e9;
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << (n - 1)); mask++) {
            double result = nums[0];
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << (i - 1))) != 0) {
                    result /= nums[i];
                } else {
                    result /= (double)nums[i];
                }
            }
            maxResult = max(maxResult, result);
        }
        return maxResult;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{n-1})$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we're trying all possible subsets of the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we're only using a constant amount of space to store the result and the current subset.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is exponential because we're trying all possible subsets, and the space complexity is constant because we're not using any data structures that grow with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: To maximize the result, we should divide the smallest numbers first.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: We can achieve this by adding parentheses around all numbers except the first one.
- Proof of optimality: This is because dividing the smallest numbers first will result in the largest possible denominator, which maximizes the final result.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is optimal because it takes into account the order of operations and the properties of division.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string optimalDivision(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 2) {
            return to_string(nums[0]) + "/" + to_string(nums[1]);
        }
        string result = to_string(nums[0]) + "/(";
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            result += to_string(nums[i]) + "/";
        }
        result += to_string(nums[n - 1]) + ")";
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we're iterating over the array once to build the result string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, since we're building a string that grows with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it takes into account the order of operations and the properties of division, and it produces the maximum possible result.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The importance of understanding the order of operations and the properties of division.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using parentheses to change the order of operations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Considering the properties of division to maximize the final result.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve maximizing or minimizing a result based on the order of operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not considering the order of operations, or not using parentheses correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: When the input array has only two elements, we should not add parentheses.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an exponential-time approach when a linear-time approach is possible.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different input sizes and edge cases to ensure the solution is correct and efficient.
