## Koko Eating Bananas
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of integers `piles` representing the number of bananas in each pile and an integer `h` representing the number of hours Koko has to eat all the bananas, determine the minimum speed at which Koko must eat bananas to finish all piles within the given time.
- Expected output format: The minimum speed at which Koko can eat bananas to finish all piles within `h` hours.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The speed must be an integer, and Koko can only eat a whole number of bananas per hour from a pile.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `piles = [3,6,7,11]`, `h = 8`, Output: `4`, Explanation: Koko needs to eat at least 4 bananas per hour to finish all piles within 8 hours.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check all possible speeds from 1 to the maximum number of bananas in a pile to see if Koko can finish all piles within the given time at that speed.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: Iterate over all possible speeds, calculate the time it takes to finish each pile at the current speed, and check if the total time is less than or equal to the given time.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that checks all possibilities.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {
        int maxPile = *max_element(piles.begin(), piles.end());
        for (int speed = 1; speed <= maxPile; speed++) {
            int time = 0;
            for (int pile : piles) {
                time += (pile + speed - 1) / speed;
            }
            if (time <= h) {
                return speed;
            }
        }
        return -1; // This should not happen based on the problem constraints
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times m)$, where $n$ is the number of piles and $m$ is the maximum number of bananas in a pile, because for each possible speed, we iterate over all piles.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the nested loop structure (iterating over speeds and then over piles), and the space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that scale with input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use binary search to find the minimum speed. The idea is to search for the minimum speed in the range from 1 to the maximum number of bananas in a pile.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: We start by defining the search range as [1, maxPile]. We then calculate the middle speed and check if Koko can finish all piles within the given time at this speed. If Koko can finish, we try to decrease the speed by moving the right boundary of the search range. If Koko cannot finish, we increase the speed by moving the left boundary.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses binary search, which reduces the search space by half at each step, leading to a time complexity of $O(n \log m)$.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This is the best we can do because we must check at least one speed in the worst case, and binary search is the most efficient way to find an element in a sorted range.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {
        int maxPile = *max_element(piles.begin(), piles.end());
        int left = 1, right = maxPile;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int time = 0;
            for (int pile : piles) {
                time += (pile + mid - 1) / mid;
            }
            if (time <= h) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log m)$, where $n$ is the number of piles and $m$ is the maximum number of bananas in a pile, because we perform a binary search over the possible speeds and for each speed, we iterate over all piles.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because binary search minimizes the number of checks needed to find the minimum speed.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Binary search and the importance of considering the search space.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The use of binary search to find the minimum or maximum of something.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the search space to improve efficiency.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding a minimum or maximum value within a range.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not properly handling the case where the minimum speed is at the boundary of the search range.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where the input array is empty or the given time is 0.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using binary search, which can lead to a significant increase in time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Make sure to test the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
