## Find the Derangement of an Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-derangement-of-an-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the derangement of the array.
- Expected output format: Return the derangement of the array.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: A derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position. In other words, given two arrays `nums` and `index`, return the derangement of `nums` with respect to `index`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `nums = [100, 101, 102]` and `index = [0, 1, 2]`, the output should be `[100, 101, 102]` because the elements at the given indices are already in their correct positions.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One way to solve this problem is to use a brute force approach by generating all possible permutations of the `nums` array and then checking if each permutation is a derangement with respect to the `index` array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of the `nums` array.
  2. For each permutation, check if it is a derangement with respect to the `index` array.
  3. If a derangement is found, return it.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it is not efficient for large inputs because generating all permutations of an array of size `n` has a time complexity of $O(n!)$, which is very high.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void generatePermutations(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end, vector<vector<int>>& permutations) {
    if (start == end) {
        permutations.push_back(nums);
    } else {
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            swap(nums[start], nums[i]);
            generatePermutations(nums, start + 1, end, permutations);
            swap(nums[start], nums[i]);
        }
    }
}

vector<int> findDerangement(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& index) {
    vector<vector<int>> permutations;
    generatePermutations(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1, permutations);
    for (const auto& permutation : permutations) {
        bool isDerangement = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (permutation[i] == nums[index[i]]) {
                isDerangement = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isDerangement) {
            return permutation;
        }
    }
    return {}; // Return an empty vector if no derangement is found
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$, where $n$ is the size of the `nums` array. This is because generating all permutations of an array of size `n` has a time complexity of $O(n!)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n!)$, where $n$ is the size of the `nums` array. This is because we need to store all permutations of the `nums` array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are generating all permutations of the `nums` array, which is a very time-consuming and memory-intensive operation.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a more efficient algorithm to find the derangement of the array. Instead of generating all permutations of the `nums` array, we can use a greedy approach to construct the derangement.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty vector `derangement` to store the derangement of the `nums` array.
  2. Iterate over the `index` array and for each index `i`, find the element in the `nums` array that is not equal to the element at index `i` in the `derangement` array. If such an element is found, add it to the `derangement` array and remove it from the `nums` array.
  3. If no such element is found, it means that the `nums` array does not have a derangement with respect to the `index` array, so return an empty vector.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is much better than the brute force approach.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it uses a greedy strategy to construct the derangement, which is the most efficient way to solve this problem.

```cpp
vector<int> findDerangement(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& index) {
    vector<int> derangement(nums.size());
    vector<bool> used(nums.size(), false);
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (!used[j] && nums[j] != nums[index[i]]) {
                derangement[i] = nums[j];
                used[j] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (derangement[i] == 0) {
            return {}; // Return an empty vector if no derangement is found
        }
    }
    return derangement;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the size of the `nums` array. This is because we are iterating over the `index` array and for each index, we are iterating over the `nums` array to find the element that is not equal to the element at index `i` in the `derangement` array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the `nums` array. This is because we need to store the `derangement` array and the `used` array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, which is much better than the brute force approach. The space complexity is also optimal because we need to store the `derangement` array and the `used` array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling the case where the `nums` array does not have a derangement with respect to the `index` array.
- Edge cases to watch for: The `nums` array is empty, the `index` array is empty, the `nums` array does not have a derangement with respect to the `index` array.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach to generate all permutations of the `nums` array.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
