## Max Consecutive Ones II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A binary array `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.
- Expected output: The maximum number of consecutive ones in the array if you can flip at most one zero.
- Key requirements: The array can be modified by flipping at most one zero to maximize the consecutive ones.
- Edge cases: Empty array, array with all zeros, array with all ones.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `nums = [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1]`, Output: `6`
  - Input: `nums = [1,1,1]`, Output: `3`
  - Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`, Output: `2`

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible ways to flip one zero in the array and calculate the maximum consecutive ones for each scenario.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate through the array and find all zeros.
  2. For each zero, flip it and calculate the maximum consecutive ones.
  3. Keep track of the maximum consecutive ones found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to ensure all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxOnes = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                // Create a copy of the array to simulate flipping the zero
                vector<int> copy = nums;
                copy[i] = 1;
                int consecutiveOnes = 0;
                int maxConsecutiveOnes = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < copy.size(); j++) {
                    if (copy[j] == 1) {
                        consecutiveOnes++;
                        maxConsecutiveOnes = max(maxConsecutiveOnes, consecutiveOnes);
                    } else {
                        consecutiveOnes = 0;
                    }
                }
                maxOnes = max(maxOnes, maxConsecutiveOnes);
            }
        }
        // Handle the case where no zeros are flipped
        int consecutiveOnes = 0;
        int maxConsecutiveOnes = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                consecutiveOnes++;
                maxConsecutiveOnes = max(maxConsecutiveOnes, consecutiveOnes);
            } else {
                consecutiveOnes = 0;
            }
        }
        maxOnes = max(maxOnes, maxConsecutiveOnes);
        return maxOnes;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because for each zero in the array, we potentially iterate through the entire array again to calculate the maximum consecutive ones.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we create a copy of the array for each zero found.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested iterations and array copying, leading to high time and space complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We only need to keep track of the maximum consecutive ones that include at most one zero.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the array.
  2. Initialize a counter for the number of zeros within the current window.
  3. Expand the window to the right and update the counter as necessary.
  4. When the counter exceeds one, shrink the window from the left until the counter is one or less.
  5. Keep track of the maximum window size seen.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that we consider all possible windows that include at most one zero, without unnecessary iterations or array copying.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int maxOnes = 0;
        int zeros = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
            if (nums[right] == 0) {
                zeros++;
            }
            while (zeros > 1) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) {
                    zeros--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            maxOnes = max(maxOnes, right - left + 1);
        }
        return maxOnes;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because we make a single pass through the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the counter.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach has a linear time complexity and constant space complexity, making it optimal for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sliding window technique, two-pointer approach.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Identifying the key insight that leads to an efficient solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the problem to a single pass through the data, using constant space.
- Similar problems to practice: Other sliding window problems, such as `Minimum Window Substring` or `Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters`.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly updating the pointers or the counter.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty array, array with all zeros, array with all ones.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary iterations or array copying, leading to high time and space complexities.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with various input scenarios to ensure correctness.
