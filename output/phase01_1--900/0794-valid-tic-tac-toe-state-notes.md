## Valid Tic Tac Toe State
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-tic-tac-toe-state/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a 3x3 grid represented as a string array `board` where each element is either "X", "O", or a space representing an empty cell. The constraints are that the board must be a valid state of a Tic Tac Toe game.
- Expected output format: The output is a boolean indicating whether the given state is valid or not.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The state is valid if the number of "X"s is either equal to the number of "O"s or one more, and there is at most one winner (either "X" or "O", but not both).
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `["XOX", "OX ", "XO "]` is a valid state because "X" has one more occurrence than "O" and there is no winner.
  - `["XXX", "   ", "OOO"]` is not a valid state because there are two winners ("X" and "O").

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To determine if a Tic Tac Toe state is valid, we need to check the counts of "X" and "O" and ensure that the difference between them is either 0 or 1. We also need to check for winners and ensure that there is at most one winner.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Count the occurrences of "X" and "O" on the board.
  2. Check if the difference between the counts of "X" and "O" is valid (either 0 or 1).
  3. Check rows, columns, and diagonals for winners. If more than one type of winner is found, the state is invalid.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and checks all conditions directly.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validTicTacToe(vector<string>& board) {
        int xCount = 0, oCount = 0;
        // Count occurrences of "X" and "O"
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X') xCount++;
                else if (board[i][j] == 'O') oCount++;
            }
        }
        
        // Check if the difference between counts is valid
        if (xCount != oCount && xCount != oCount + 1) return false;
        
        // Check for winners
        bool xWins = false, oWins = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            // Check rows
            if (board[i][0] == board[i][1] && board[i][1] == board[i][2] && board[i][0] != ' ') {
                if (board[i][0] == 'X') xWins = true;
                else oWins = true;
            }
            // Check columns
            if (board[0][i] == board[1][i] && board[1][i] == board[2][i] && board[0][i] != ' ') {
                if (board[0][i] == 'X') xWins = true;
                else oWins = true;
            }
        }
        // Check diagonals
        if (board[0][0] == board[1][1] && board[1][1] == board[2][2] && board[0][0] != ' ') {
            if (board[0][0] == 'X') xWins = true;
            else oWins = true;
        }
        if (board[0][2] == board[1][1] && board[1][1] == board[2][0] && board[0][2] != ' ') {
            if (board[0][2] == 'X') xWins = true;
            else oWins = true;
        }
        
        // Check if there is at most one winner
        if ((xWins && oWins) || (xWins && xCount == oCount) || (oWins && xCount != oCount)) return false;
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the input size is fixed (3x3 grid), so the number of operations is constant.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the space used does not grow with the input size (it's a fixed-size grid).
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking each cell of the grid once and then checking for winners, which can be done in a constant number of steps due to the fixed size of the input.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight here is that the problem doesn't require us to find the winner or the next move but to validate the state. This can be achieved by simply counting "X" and "O" and checking for at most one winner.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Count "X" and "O".
  2. Check the difference between their counts.
  3. Check rows, columns, and diagonals for "X" and "O" wins.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly checks all conditions necessary for a valid Tic Tac Toe state without any redundant steps.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Given the constraints of the problem, any solution must at least check the counts of "X" and "O" and verify that there is at most one winner, which this approach does efficiently.

The code provided in the brute force section is already optimal for this problem, given the fixed size of the input and the simplicity of the required checks. Therefore, no separate code block is needed for the optimal approach.

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the number of operations does not depend on the input size due to the fixed-size grid.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the space used does not grow with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most straightforward and efficient way to validate a Tic Tac Toe state given the constraints of the problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking all possible winning combinations or miscounting "X" and "O".
- Edge cases to watch for: The difference in counts between "X" and "O", and ensuring there's at most one winner.
- Performance pitfalls: Overcomplicating the solution with unnecessary checks or data structures.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with different winning scenarios, and cases where "X" or "O" have different counts.
