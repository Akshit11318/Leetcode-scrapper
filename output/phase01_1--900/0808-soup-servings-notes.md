**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/soup-servings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of servings of soup. The goal is to determine the probability of serving all the soup before running out of servings.
- Expected output format: The output should be the probability of serving all the soup before running out of servings.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The problem requires considering all possible sequences of serving soup and calculating the probability of serving all the soup before running out of servings.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `n = 50`, the output should be the probability of serving all the soup before running out of servings.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves simulating all possible sequences of serving soup and calculating the probability of serving all the soup before running out of servings.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the total number of simulations.
  2. Initialize a variable to store the number of successful simulations (i.e., simulations where all the soup is served before running out of servings).
  3. Simulate all possible sequences of serving soup by randomly selecting the number of servings to serve at each step.
  4. For each simulation, check if all the soup is served before running out of servings. If so, increment the number of successful simulations.
  5. Calculate the probability of serving all the soup before running out of servings by dividing the number of successful simulations by the total number of simulations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is often the first approach that comes to mind because it involves simulating all possible scenarios and calculating the desired outcome.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <random>

double soupServingsBruteForce(int n) {
    const int numSimulations = 100000;
    int successfulSimulations = 0;
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    std::uniform_int_distribution<int> dis(1, 4);

    for (int i = 0; i < numSimulations; i++) {
        int servings = n;
        bool success = true;
        while (servings > 0) {
            int servingSize = dis(gen);
            servings -= servingSize;
            if (servings < 0) {
                success = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (success) {
            successfulSimulations++;
        }
    }

    return (double) successfulSimulations / numSimulations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot numSimulations)$, where $n$ is the number of servings and $numSimulations$ is the number of simulations. The time complexity is high because we are simulating all possible sequences of serving soup.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only need to store a few variables to keep track of the simulations.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are simulating all possible sequences of serving soup, which can result in a large number of simulations. The space complexity is low because we only need to store a few variables to keep track of the simulations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the results of subproblems, where `dp[i][j]` represents the probability of serving all the soup before running out of servings when there are `i` servings of soup A and `j` servings of soup B.
  2. Fill in the `dp` array using the following recurrence relation: `dp[i][j] = (dp[i-4][j] + dp[i-3][j-1] + dp[i-2][j-2] + dp[i-1][j-3]) / 4`, where `dp[i][j]` is the probability of serving all the soup before running out of servings when there are `i` servings of soup A and `j` servings of soup B.
  3. The base cases are `dp[0][0] = 1` (i.e., there are no servings of soup A or soup B, so the probability of serving all the soup is 1) and `dp[i][0] = 0` for `i > 0` (i.e., there are no servings of soup B, so the probability of serving all the soup is 0).
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it avoids redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems in the `dp` array.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

double soupServings(int n) {
    if (n >= 4800) {
        return 1.0;
    }
    std::vector<std::vector<double>> dp(n / 25 + 1, std::vector<double>(n / 25 + 1, 0.0));
    dp[0][0] = 1.0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n / 25; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n / 25; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = (dp[max(0, i - 4)][j] + dp[max(0, i - 3)][max(0, j - 1)] + dp[max(0, i - 2)][max(0, j - 2)] + dp[max(0, i - 1)][max(0, j - 3)]) / 4.0;
        }
    }
    return dp[n / 25][n / 25];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of servings. The time complexity is quadratic because we need to fill in the `dp` array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, because we need to store the `dp` array.
> - **Optimality proof:** The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it avoids redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems in the `dp` array.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming and memoization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a 2D array to store the results of subproblems and avoiding redundant calculations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve dynamic programming and memoization.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` array correctly or not handling the base cases correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where `n` is large and the `dp` array is too large to fit in memory.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations, which can result in a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different values of `n` to ensure that it works correctly.
