## Logical OR of Two Binary Grids Represented as Quad Trees

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/logical-or-of-two-binary-grids-represented-as-quad-trees/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two `QuadTree` objects `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`.
- Constraints: Both `quadTree1` and `quadTree2` represent the same `n x n` binary grid.
- Expected Output: Return the `QuadTree` object representing the binary grid where each cell is the logical OR of the corresponding cells in `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`.
- Key Requirements: The output should also be a valid `QuadTree`.
- Edge Cases: Consider cases where the input trees are leaf nodes (representing a single cell), and where they are internal nodes.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves directly computing the logical OR of the two grids cell by cell.
- However, since the grids are represented as quad trees, we need to traverse these trees, comparing and combining their nodes appropriately.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement without considering optimizations related to the structure of quad trees.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* intersect(Node* quadTree1, Node* quadTree2) {
        // Base case: If one of the trees is a leaf node
        if (quadTree1->isLeaf) return quadTree1->val || quadTree2->val ? new Node(true, true) : new Node(true, false);
        if (quadTree2->isLeaf) return quadTree1->val || quadTree2->val ? new Node(true, true) : new Node(true, false);

        // Recursively intersect the child nodes
        Node* topLeft = intersect(quadTree1->topLeft, quadTree2->topLeft);
        Node* topRight = intersect(quadTree1->topRight, quadTree2->topRight);
        Node* bottomLeft = intersect(quadTree1->bottomLeft, quadTree2->bottomLeft);
        Node* bottomRight = intersect(quadTree1->bottomRight, quadTree2->bottomRight);

        // If all child nodes are the same leaf node, return that leaf node
        if (isSame(topLeft, topRight) && isSame(topLeft, bottomLeft) && isSame(topLeft, bottomRight)) {
            return new Node(true, topLeft->val);
        }

        // Otherwise, return an internal node with the intersected child nodes
        return new Node(false, false, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight);
    }

    bool isSame(Node* node1, Node* node2) {
        if (node1->isLeaf && node2->isLeaf) return node1->val == node2->val;
        if (node1->isLeaf || node2->isLeaf) return false;
        return isSame(node1->topLeft, node2->topLeft) && isSame(node1->topRight, node2->topRight)
            && isSame(node1->bottomLeft, node2->bottomLeft) && isSame(node1->bottomRight, node2->bottomRight);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the side length of the grid, because in the worst case, we might need to compare every cell.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, for storing the resulting quad tree.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are potentially comparing every cell in the two grids and storing the result in a new quad tree.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to leverage the properties of quad trees and the logical OR operation to minimize the number of comparisons needed.
- If a node is a leaf node, we can directly compute the logical OR with the corresponding node in the other tree.
- For internal nodes, we recursively intersect the child nodes and then check if all child nodes are the same leaf node. If they are, we can replace the internal node with a leaf node representing the logical OR of the child nodes.
- This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of nodes in the resulting quad tree by merging identical child nodes into a single leaf node.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* intersect(Node* quadTree1, Node* quadTree2) {
        // If both trees are leaf nodes, return a new leaf node with the logical OR of their values
        if (quadTree1->isLeaf && quadTree2->isLeaf) {
            return new Node(true, quadTree1->val || quadTree2->val);
        }
        
        // If one of the trees is a leaf node and the other is not, return the non-leaf node
        if (quadTree1->isLeaf) return quadTree1;
        if (quadTree2->isLeaf) return quadTree2;

        // Recursively intersect the child nodes
        Node* topLeft = intersect(quadTree1->topLeft, quadTree2->topLeft);
        Node* topRight = intersect(quadTree1->topRight, quadTree2->topRight);
        Node* bottomLeft = intersect(quadTree1->bottomLeft, quadTree2->bottomLeft);
        Node* bottomRight = intersect(quadTree1->bottomRight, quadTree2->bottomRight);

        // If all child nodes are the same leaf node, return that leaf node
        if (isSame(topLeft, topRight) && isSame(topLeft, bottomLeft) && isSame(topLeft, bottomRight)) {
            return topLeft;
        }

        // Otherwise, return an internal node with the intersected child nodes
        return new Node(false, false, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight);
    }

    bool isSame(Node* node1, Node* node2) {
        if (node1->isLeaf && node2->isLeaf) return node1->val == node2->val;
        if (node1->isLeaf || node2->isLeaf) return false;
        return isSame(node1->topLeft, node2->topLeft) && isSame(node1->topRight, node2->topRight)
            && isSame(node1->bottomLeft, node2->bottomLeft) && isSame(node1->bottomRight, node2->bottomRight);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ in the worst case, but can be significantly less if the trees have many identical subtrees.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ for storing the resulting quad tree, but again, this can be less if the output tree is more compact.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of comparisons needed by leveraging the structure of the quad trees and the properties of the logical OR operation.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of understanding the structure and properties of quad trees.
- How to apply recursive approaches to tree-like data structures.
- The value of minimizing comparisons by leveraging the properties of the operations involved.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the properties of the logical OR operation when comparing nodes.
- Failing to optimize the construction of the resulting quad tree by not merging identical child nodes.
- Not handling the base cases (leaf nodes) correctly in the recursive approach.
