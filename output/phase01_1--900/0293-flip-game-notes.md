## Flip Game
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 1000`.
- Expected output: A list of strings, where each string is a possible state of the game after a move.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The game starts with the given string `s`, and a move consists of flipping two adjacent characters from '+' to '-' or vice versa.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `s = "++++"`
    - Output: `["--++","+--++]`
  - Input: `s = "+-+"`
    - Output: `["-+-","+-+"]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible states of the game by iterating through the string and flipping each pair of adjacent characters.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty list to store the possible states.
  2. Iterate through the string using a loop.
  3. For each pair of adjacent characters, flip them and add the resulting string to the list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward way to generate all possible states of the game.

```cpp
vector<string> generatePossibleNextMoves(string s) {
    vector<string> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
        if (s[i] == '+' && s[i + 1] == '+') {
            string temp = s;
            temp[i] = '-';
            temp[i + 1] = '-';
            result.push_back(temp);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are iterating through the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because in the worst case, we might need to store all possible states of the game, which is proportional to the length of the string.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating through the string once, and the space complexity occurs because we are storing all possible states of the game.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all possible states of the game, we can directly generate the possible next moves by checking for adjacent '+' characters.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty list to store the possible next moves.
  2. Iterate through the string using a loop.
  3. For each pair of adjacent characters, check if they are both '+'.
  4. If they are, flip them and add the resulting string to the list.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly generates the possible next moves without generating all possible states of the game.

```cpp
vector<string> generatePossibleNextMoves(string s) {
    vector<string> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
        if (s[i] == '+' && s[i + 1] == '+') {
            string temp = s;
            temp[i] = '-';
            temp[i + 1] = '-';
            result.push_back(temp);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly generates the possible next moves without generating all possible states of the game, resulting in the same time and space complexity as the brute force approach but with a more efficient implementation.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional statements, and string manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Directly generating the possible next moves instead of generating all possible states of the game.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary computations by directly generating the possible next moves.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving string manipulation and iteration.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for adjacent '+' characters correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty strings or strings with only one character.
- Performance pitfalls: Generating all possible states of the game instead of directly generating the possible next moves.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input strings to ensure it generates the correct possible next moves.
