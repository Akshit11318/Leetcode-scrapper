## Valid Parenthesis String
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: a string `s` containing `(`, `)`, and `*` characters.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: a boolean indicating whether the string is valid.
- Key requirements: a string is valid if it can be parsed into a valid sequence of parentheses.
- Edge cases to consider: strings with only `*` characters, strings with no `*` characters, and strings with a mix of `(`, `)`, and `*` characters.
- Example test cases:
  - `"()"` is valid.
  - `"(*)"` is valid.
  - `"(*))"` is valid.
  - `")*("` is not valid.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to generate all possible combinations of `(` and `)` that can replace the `*` characters, and then check each combination to see if it forms a valid sequence of parentheses.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of `(` and `)` that can replace the `*` characters.
  2. For each combination, replace the `*` characters in the string with the corresponding `(` or `)` characters.
  3. Check if the resulting string is a valid sequence of parentheses by using a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: it is a straightforward way to solve the problem, but it is not efficient due to the large number of possible combinations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <stack>

bool checkValidString(const std::string& s) {
    int n = s.size();
    std::vector<bool> dp(n + 1, false);
    dp[0] = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::vector<bool> temp(n + 1, false);
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            if (dp[j]) {
                if (s[i] == '(' || s[i] == '*') {
                    temp[j + 1] = true;
                }
                if (s[i] == ')' || s[i] == '*') {
                    if (j > 0) {
                        temp[j - 1] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        dp = temp;
    }
    return dp[0];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we are using a dynamic programming approach with a nested loop.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we are using a vector to store the dynamic programming state.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating over the string and the dynamic programming state in a nested loop. The space complexity occurs because we are storing the dynamic programming state in a vector.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: we can use two pointers to keep track of the minimum and maximum possible number of open parentheses.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize two pointers, `lo` and `hi`, to 0. These pointers represent the minimum and maximum possible number of open parentheses.
  2. Iterate over the string. For each character:
    - If the character is `(`, increment both `lo` and `hi`.
    - If the character is `)`, decrement both `lo` and `hi`. If `lo` becomes negative, return false.
    - If the character is `*`, increment `hi` and decrement `lo`. If `lo` becomes negative, set it to 0.
  3. After iterating over the string, if `hi` is not 0, return false. Otherwise, return true.
- Proof of optimality: this approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the string, and it uses a constant amount of extra memory to store the two pointers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool checkValidString(const std::string& s) {
    int lo = 0, hi = 0;
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '(') {
            lo++;
            hi++;
        } else if (c == ')') {
            lo--;
            hi--;
        } else {
            lo--;
            hi++;
        }
        if (hi < 0) return false;
        if (lo < 0) lo = 0;
    }
    return lo == 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we are only iterating over the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we are only using a constant amount of extra memory to store the two pointers.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the string, and it uses a constant amount of extra memory to store the two pointers.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: dynamic programming, two pointers.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using dynamic programming to solve problems with overlapping subproblems, using two pointers to solve problems with a sliding window.
- Optimization techniques learned: reducing the time complexity by using a more efficient algorithm, reducing the space complexity by using a more efficient data structure.
- Similar problems to practice: other problems that involve dynamic programming or two pointers, such as the "Longest Valid Parentheses" problem or the "Minimum Window Substring" problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: off-by-one errors, incorrect handling of edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: strings with only `*` characters, strings with no `*` characters, and strings with a mix of `(`, `)`, and `*` characters.
- Performance pitfalls: using an inefficient algorithm or data structure, such as using a recursive approach or a brute force approach.
- Testing considerations: testing the function with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and large inputs, to ensure that it is working correctly and efficiently.
