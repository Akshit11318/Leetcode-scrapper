## Read N Characters Given Read4
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The function `read` is given an integer `n` and a character array `buf`. It needs to read `n` characters from a file and store them in `buf`.
- Expected output format: The function should return the number of characters read.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The function `read4` is provided which reads 4 characters from the file. The `read` function should use `read4` to read `n` characters.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 4, the function should read `n` characters and return `n`.
  - If `n` is greater than 4, the function should read `n` characters in chunks of 4 and return `n`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Use the `read4` function to read 4 characters at a time and store them in `buf`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an index `i` to keep track of the current position in `buf`.
  2. While `i` is less than `n`, read 4 characters using `read4` and store them in a temporary array.
  3. If the number of characters read is less than 4, break the loop.
  4. Copy the characters from the temporary array to `buf` and increment `i` by the number of characters copied.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that uses the provided `read4` function to read characters in chunks.

```cpp
/**
 * @param buf Destination buffer
 * @param n   Number of characters to read
 * @return    The number of characters read
 */
int read(char *buf, int n) {
    char temp[4];
    int i = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        int count = read4(temp);
        if (count == 0) break;
        int num = min(count, n - i);
        memcpy(buf + i, temp, num);
        i += num;
    }
    return i;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of characters to read. This is because we are reading characters in chunks of 4, and the number of chunks is proportional to $n$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the temporary array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are reading characters in chunks, and the space complexity occurs because we are using a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is similar to the brute force approach, but with some minor optimizations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an index `i` to keep track of the current position in `buf`.
  2. While `i` is less than `n`, read 4 characters using `read4` and store them in a temporary array.
  3. If the number of characters read is less than 4, break the loop.
  4. Copy the characters from the temporary array to `buf` and increment `i` by the number of characters copied.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it uses the provided `read4` function to read characters in chunks, which is the most efficient way to read characters.

```cpp
/**
 * @param buf Destination buffer
 * @param n   Number of characters to read
 * @return    The number of characters read
 */
int read(char *buf, int n) {
    char temp[4];
    int i = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        int count = read4(temp);
        if (count == 0) break;
        int num = min(count, n - i);
        memcpy(buf + i, temp, num);
        i += num;
    }
    return i;
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it uses the provided `read4` function to read characters in chunks, which is the most efficient way to read characters.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Reading characters in chunks, using a temporary array to store characters.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a while loop to read characters until the desired number of characters is reached.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using `min` to limit the number of characters copied to the destination buffer.
- Similar problems to practice: Reading characters from a file, writing characters to a file.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking the return value of `read4`, not using `min` to limit the number of characters copied.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `n` is less than or equal to 4, when `n` is greater than 4.
- Performance pitfalls: Reading characters one by one instead of in chunks.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different values of `n`, testing with different contents of the file.
