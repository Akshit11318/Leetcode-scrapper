## Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a `nums` array of integers and a `target` integer. The array `nums` is a rotated sorted array where each element is unique except for duplicates, and the task is to find the index of the `target` if it exists in the array.
- Expected output format: Return the index of the `target` if it exists; otherwise, return `-1`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling duplicates, dealing with an empty array, and finding an efficient algorithm that can handle the rotated and sorted nature of the array.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0`: The function should return one of the indices of `0` because `0` is present in the array.
  - `nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3`: The function should return `-1` because `3` is not present in the array.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The simplest way to find the `target` in the `nums` array is to iterate through each element and check if it matches the `target`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: Start from the first element of the array and compare it with the `target`. If they match, return the index of the current element. If not, move to the next element and repeat the comparison until the end of the array is reached or the `target` is found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward and ensures that every element is checked, making it a reliable but inefficient method.

```cpp
int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] == target) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the `nums` array, because in the worst case, we need to check every element once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store the loop variable and do not allocate any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The linear time complexity is due to the linear search through the array, and the constant space complexity is due to the minimal use of extra memory.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The array is rotated and sorted, but it contains duplicates. This means we can't directly apply the standard binary search algorithm because duplicates can lead to ambiguity in determining which half of the array to search in. However, we can modify the binary search approach to handle duplicates by adjusting the conditions under which we decide to search the left or right half.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: We start with the standard binary search setup, but when we encounter a situation where the middle element is equal to the leftmost element (due to duplicates), we cannot be sure which half to proceed with based solely on the middle element's value. In such cases, we increment the left pointer to move past the duplicate, effectively shrinking the search space.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it still achieves a time complexity better than linear search in the average case, even though the worst-case scenario (when all elements are the same) degrades to linear time complexity.

```cpp
int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    if (nums.empty()) return -1;
    
    int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
        
        // If the left half is sorted
        if (nums[left] < nums[mid]) {
            if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        } 
        // If the right half is sorted
        else if (nums[left] > nums[mid]) {
            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        } 
        // If nums[left] == nums[mid], we can't be sure which half is sorted, so we just move left one step to the right
        else {
            left++;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ in the worst case (when all elements are the same), but it can be much better in practice, approaching $O(\log n)$ when there are no duplicates.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The algorithm is designed to take advantage of the sorted nature of the array while handling duplicates. In the worst case, it degrades to linear time complexity, but for most practical scenarios with distinct or nearly distinct elements, it performs significantly better.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Modified binary search to handle duplicates in a rotated sorted array.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Handling edge cases like empty arrays and duplicates, and optimizing search algorithms for specific data structures.
- Optimization techniques learned: Adapting binary search for rotated and sorted arrays with duplicates.
- Similar problems to practice: Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling the conditions for moving the search space pointers.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty arrays, arrays with all elements being the same, and the target being at the start or end of the array.
- Performance pitfalls: Failing to optimize the search for the average case, leading to unnecessary iterations.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with various edge cases, including duplicates, to ensure the algorithm's robustness.
