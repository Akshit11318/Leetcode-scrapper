## Minimum Size Subarray Sum
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-in-infinite-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the length of the shortest subarray that sums to at least `k`. If no such subarray exists, return -1.
- Input format and constraints:
  - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
  - `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
  - `1 <= k <= 10^9`
- Expected output format: The length of the shortest subarray that sums to at least `k`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - Handling negative numbers in the array.
  - Handling large sums that exceed `k`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = [2, -1, 2]` and `k = 3`, the shortest subarray that sums to at least `3` is `[3]`, which is not possible with the given array. However, a subarray that sums to at least `3` is not present, but the sum of the first two elements and the last element is `3`. Thus, the answer is `3`.
  - For `nums = [1, 4, 4]` and `k = 4`, the shortest subarray that sums to at least `4` is `[4]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the shortest subarray that sums to at least `k`, we can check all possible subarrays.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Generate all possible subarrays of the given array `nums`.
  2. For each subarray, calculate its sum.
  3. If the sum is at least `k`, update the minimum length found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward to generate all possible subarrays and check their sums.

```cpp
int minSubArrayLen(int k, vector<int>& nums) {
    int min_len = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int l = i; l <= j; l++) {
                sum += nums[l];
            }
            if (sum >= k) {
                min_len = min(min_len, j - i + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return min_len == INT_MAX ? -1 : min_len;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we have three nested loops to generate all possible subarrays and calculate their sums.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum length and the sum of the current subarray.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inefficient because it checks all possible subarrays, resulting in a high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a two-pointer technique (also known as the sliding window technique) to efficiently find the shortest subarray that sums to at least `k`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the array.
  2. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of the elements in the current window.
  3. Move the `right` pointer to the right, adding the elements to `sum` until `sum` is at least `k`.
  4. Once `sum` is at least `k`, update the minimum length found so far.
  5. Move the `left` pointer to the right, subtracting the elements from `sum` until `sum` is less than `k`.
  6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The two-pointer technique is optimal because it only checks the necessary subarrays and uses a constant amount of space.

```cpp
int minSubArrayLen(int k, vector<int>& nums) {
    int min_len = INT_MAX;
    for (int left = 0; left < nums.size(); left++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int right = left; right < nums.size(); right++) {
            sum += nums[right];
            if (sum >= k) {
                min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return min_len == INT_MAX ? -1 : min_len;
}
```

However, the optimal solution can be further optimized using a prefix sum array and binary search.

```cpp
int minSubArrayLen(int k, vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> prefix(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + nums[i];
    }
    int min_len = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int target = prefix[i] + k;
        int j = lower_bound(prefix.begin() + i + 1, prefix.end(), target) - prefix.begin();
        if (j <= n) {
            min_len = min(min_len, j - i);
        }
    }
    return min_len == INT_MAX ? -1 : min_len;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we use a prefix sum array and binary search to find the shortest subarray that sums to at least `k`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we use a prefix sum array to store the cumulative sums of the elements in the array.
> - **Optimality proof:** The two-pointer technique with a prefix sum array and binary search is optimal because it only checks the necessary subarrays and uses a efficient search algorithm.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Two-pointer technique, prefix sum array, binary search.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a prefix sum array to simplify the problem, applying binary search to find the shortest subarray.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a two-pointer technique to reduce the number of subarrays to check, applying binary search to find the shortest subarray.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases, such as an empty array or a target sum that is less than the minimum element in the array.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling negative numbers in the array, handling large sums that exceed the target sum.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that checks all possible subarrays, resulting in a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input arrays and target sums to ensure it works correctly in all cases.
