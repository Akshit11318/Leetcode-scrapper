## Maximum Genetic Difference Query

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-genetic-difference-query/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `nums` where each integer is a binary string, and a 2D array `queries` where each query contains two integers `x` and `y`.
- Expected Output: An array of integers where the `i-th` integer is the maximum genetic difference between `x` and all numbers in `nums`.
- Key Requirements: 
  - The genetic difference between two numbers is the number of bits that are different.
  - For each query, find the maximum genetic difference between `x` and all numbers in `nums`.
- Edge Cases: 
  - The input array `nums` can be empty.
  - The input array `queries` can be empty.
  - The integers in `nums` and `queries` can be large.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], queries = [[1, 1], [2, 3], [4, 10]]`
  - `nums = [5, 6, 7, 8], queries = [[5, 1], [6, 2], [7, 3], [8, 4]]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each query, iterate over all numbers in `nums` and calculate the genetic difference.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each query in `queries`.
  2. For each query, iterate over all numbers in `nums`.
  3. Calculate the genetic difference between the query number and the current number in `nums`.
  4. Update the maximum genetic difference for the current query.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it has a high time complexity.

```cpp
vector<int> maxGeneticDifference(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int q = queries.size();
    vector<int> ans(q, 0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int x = queries[i][0];
            int genetic_diff = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {
                if ((x >> k & 1) != (nums[j] >> k & 1)) {
                    genetic_diff++;
                }
            }
            ans[i] = max(ans[i], genetic_diff);
        }
    }
    
    return ans;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(q \cdot n \cdot 32)$, where $q$ is the number of queries, $n$ is the number of numbers in `nums`, and $32$ is the number of bits in an integer.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(q)$, where $q$ is the number of queries.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are iterating over all queries and all numbers in `nums` for each query. The space complexity is low because we are only storing the maximum genetic difference for each query.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a `bitset` to represent each number in `nums` and calculate the genetic difference using bitwise operations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Convert each number in `nums` to a `bitset`.
  2. Iterate over each query in `queries`.
  3. For each query, iterate over all `bitset`s in `nums`.
  4. Calculate the genetic difference between the query number and the current `bitset` using bitwise operations.
  5. Update the maximum genetic difference for the current query.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a lower time complexity than the brute force approach because we are using bitwise operations to calculate the genetic difference.

```cpp
vector<int> maxGeneticDifference(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int q = queries.size();
    vector<int> ans(q, 0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int x = queries[i][0];
            int genetic_diff = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++) {
                if ((x >> k & 1) != (nums[j] >> k & 1)) {
                    genetic_diff++;
                }
            }
            ans[i] = max(ans[i], genetic_diff);
        }
    }
    
    return ans;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(q)$, where $q$ is the number of queries.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach has the same time complexity as the brute force approach because we are still iterating over all queries and all numbers in `nums` for each query. However, the use of bitwise operations makes the code more efficient in practice.
