## Maximum Strong Pair XOR II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-strong-pair-xor-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of the same length `n`, find the maximum XOR of pairs of elements `x` and `y` such that `x` is from `nums1` and `y` is from `nums2`.
- The input arrays contain integers, and the length of the arrays is between 1 and 10^5.
- The expected output is the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from pairs of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases:**
- The arrays can contain duplicate elements.
- The maximum XOR value should be found among all possible pairs of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The XOR operation has the property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`, which can be used to simplify the problem.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `nums1 = [2, 1, 2], nums2 = [2, 3, 0]`, the maximum XOR is `4` (obtained from `2 ^ 2`).
- `nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [1, 2]`, the maximum XOR is `0` (obtained from `1 ^ 1` or `2 ^ 2`).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate over all pairs of elements from `nums1` and `nums2` and calculate the XOR of each pair.
- The maximum XOR value is updated whenever a larger XOR value is found.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaximumXOR(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int max_xor = 0;
        for (int x : nums1) {
            for (int y : nums2) {
                max_xor = max(max_xor, x ^ y);
            }
        }
        return max_xor;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input arrays, because we are iterating over all pairs of elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the maximum XOR value.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity because it checks all possible pairs of elements, resulting in a quadratic number of operations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a `Trie` data structure to store the binary representations of the elements in `nums1`.
- We then iterate over the elements in `nums2` and use the `Trie` to find the maximum XOR value for each element.
- The `Trie` allows us to efficiently find the maximum XOR value by traversing the binary tree and choosing the path that maximizes the XOR value.

```cpp
class TrieNode {
public:
    TrieNode* children[2];
    TrieNode() {
        children[0] = children[1] = nullptr;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaximumXOR(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        TrieNode* root = new TrieNode();
        for (int x : nums1) {
            TrieNode* node = root;
            for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
                int bit = (x >> i) & 1;
                if (!node->children[bit]) {
                    node->children[bit] = new TrieNode();
                }
                node = node->children[bit];
            }
        }
        
        int max_xor = 0;
        for (int y : nums2) {
            TrieNode* node = root;
            int xor_val = 0;
            for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
                int bit = (y >> i) & 1;
                if (node->children[1 - bit]) {
                    xor_val |= (1 << i);
                    node = node->children[1 - bit];
                } else {
                    node = node->children[bit];
                }
            }
            max_xor = max(max_xor, xor_val);
        }
        return max_xor;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot b)$, where $n$ is the length of the input arrays and $b$ is the number of bits in the binary representation of the elements, because we are iterating over the elements and their binary representations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot b)$, because we are storing the binary representations of the elements in the `Trie`.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach has a better time complexity than the brute force approach because it uses the `Trie` data structure to efficiently find the maximum XOR value for each element.
