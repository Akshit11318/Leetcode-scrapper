## Maximum Good Subarray Sum
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-good-subarray-sum/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k` where the subarray contains no more than `k-1` zeros.
- Input format: `nums` is an integer array, and `k` is an integer.
- Expected output format: The maximum sum of a subarray of size `k` with no more than `k-1` zeros.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
  - `1 <= k <= nums.length`
  - `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 3`. The maximum sum of a subarray of size 3 is 12, which is the sum of the subarray `[3,4,5]`.
  - Example 2: `nums = [1,2,0,3,0]`, `k = 3`. The maximum sum of a subarray of size 3 with no more than 2 zeros is 6, which is the sum of the subarray `[1,2,3]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to generate all possible subarrays of size `k` and check if each subarray contains no more than `k-1` zeros.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible subarrays of size `k`.
  2. For each subarray, count the number of zeros.
  3. If the number of zeros is less than or equal to `k-1`, calculate the sum of the subarray.
  4. Keep track of the maximum sum found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that checks all possible subarrays, but it is inefficient due to its high time complexity.

```cpp
int maximumGoodSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;
    for (int i = 0; i <= nums.size() - k; i++) {
        int zeroCount = 0;
        int subarraySum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
            if (nums[j] == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            }
            subarraySum += nums[j];
        }
        if (zeroCount <= k - 1) {
            maxSum = max(maxSum, subarraySum);
        }
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array `nums`. This is because we are generating all possible subarrays of size `k` and checking each one.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum sum and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are generating all possible subarrays, and the space complexity is low because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a sliding window approach to efficiently generate all possible subarrays of size `k`.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a sliding window of size `k`.
  2. Move the window to the right, one element at a time.
  3. For each window position, count the number of zeros in the window.
  4. If the number of zeros is less than or equal to `k-1`, calculate the sum of the elements in the window.
  5. Keep track of the maximum sum found.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the input array, and it uses a constant amount of space.

```cpp
int maximumGoodSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;
    int windowSum = 0;
    int zeroCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        windowSum += nums[i];
        if (nums[i] == 0) {
            zeroCount++;
        }
        if (i >= k) {
            windowSum -= nums[i - k];
            if (nums[i - k] == 0) {
                zeroCount--;
            }
        }
        if (i >= k - 1 && zeroCount <= k - 1) {
            maxSum = max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```
