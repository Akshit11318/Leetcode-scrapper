## Watering Plants

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/watering-plants/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes two parameters: `plantCapacity` (an array of integers representing the capacity of each plant) and `wateringCanCapacity` (an integer representing the capacity of the watering can).
- Expected output format: The function should return the minimum number of steps required to water all the plants.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The watering can can be refilled after each watering.
  - The function should handle edge cases such as an empty `plantCapacity` array or a `wateringCanCapacity` of 0.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `plantCapacity = [2,2,3,3]` and `wateringCanCapacity = 5`, the output should be 14 because the sequence of watering and refilling is: [water, water, refill, water, water, refill, water, water, refill, water, water, refill, water, refill].

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves simulating the watering process step by step, refilling the watering can whenever it's empty.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `steps` to 0 to keep track of the number of steps.
  2. Initialize a variable `currentWater` to `wateringCanCapacity` to keep track of the current water in the can.
  3. Iterate through each plant in the `plantCapacity` array.
  4. For each plant, check if the current water in the can is sufficient to water the plant. If it is, subtract the plant's capacity from the current water and increment the steps by 1.
  5. If the current water is not sufficient, refill the can (set `currentWater` to `wateringCanCapacity`), increment the steps by 1 (for the refill), and then water the plant (subtract the plant's capacity from the current water and increment the steps by 1).
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and simulates the real-world scenario of watering plants with a watering can.

```cpp
int wateringPlants(vector<int>& plantCapacity, int wateringCanCapacity) {
    int steps = 0;
    int currentWater = wateringCanCapacity;
    for (int i = 0; i < plantCapacity.size(); i++) {
        if (currentWater >= plantCapacity[i]) {
            currentWater -= plantCapacity[i];
        } else {
            currentWater = wateringCanCapacity;
            steps++;
            currentWater -= plantCapacity[i];
        }
        steps++;
    }
    return steps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of plants, because we iterate through the `plantCapacity` array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store the variables `steps` and `currentWater`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we process each plant once. The space complexity is constant because we don't use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can calculate the number of steps required to water each plant without simulating the process. For each plant, if the current water is sufficient, we simply increment the steps by 1. If not, we refill the can, which requires one step, and then water the plant, which requires another step.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize `steps` to 0.
  2. Initialize `currentWater` to `wateringCanCapacity`.
  3. Iterate through each plant in `plantCapacity`.
  4. For each plant, if `currentWater` is less than the plant's capacity, refill the can (add 1 to `steps` for the refill) and set `currentWater` to `wateringCanCapacity`.
  5. Subtract the plant's capacity from `currentWater` and increment `steps` by 1 for watering the plant.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of steps required without unnecessary operations. It considers refilling the can only when necessary, which minimizes the number of refills.

```cpp
int wateringPlants(vector<int>& plantCapacity, int wateringCanCapacity) {
    int steps = 0;
    int currentWater = wateringCanCapacity;
    for (int i = 0; i < plantCapacity.size(); i++) {
        if (currentWater < plantCapacity[i]) {
            steps++; // Refill
            currentWater = wateringCanCapacity;
        }
        currentWater -= plantCapacity[i];
        steps++; // Watering
    }
    return steps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of plants, because we still iterate through the `plantCapacity` array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store the variables `steps` and `currentWater`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it minimizes the number of refills by only refilling when the can is empty and a plant needs more water than the can currently holds. It directly calculates the minimum steps required without simulating the process unnecessarily.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Direct calculation of minimum steps, optimization by minimizing refills.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Simulating a process can sometimes be replaced with direct calculation if the pattern of the process is well understood.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minimizing unnecessary operations (like refills in this case) can lead to optimal solutions.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve minimizing steps or operations, such as scheduling tasks or resource allocation problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not considering edge cases like an empty plant capacity array or a watering can capacity of 0.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where the watering can's capacity is exactly enough to water a plant without needing a refill.
- Performance pitfalls: Unnecessary simulations or operations that increase the time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing with various input sizes and edge cases to ensure the solution is robust.
