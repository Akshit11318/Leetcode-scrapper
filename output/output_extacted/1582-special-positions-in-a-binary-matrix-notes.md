## Special Positions in a Binary Matrix
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/special-positions-in-a-binary-matrix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A binary matrix `mat` of size `m x n`.
- Constraints: `1 <= m <= 100`, `1 <= n <= 100`, `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- Expected output format: The number of special positions in the matrix.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: A position `(i, j)` is special if the sum of the row `i` and the sum of the column `j` is greater than or equal to `2 * mat[i][j]`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `mat = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]`, Output: `3`. Each position is special because the sum of the row and the sum of the column is greater than or equal to twice the value at that position.
  - `mat = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]`, Output: `2`. Positions `(0,0)` and `(2,2)` are special.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the special positions, we need to calculate the sum of each row and each column, then compare these sums with twice the value at each position.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Calculate the sum of each row and store it in an array `rowSums`.
  2. Calculate the sum of each column and store it in an array `colSums`.
  3. Iterate over each position in the matrix. For each position `(i, j)`, check if the sum of the row `i` and the sum of the column `j` is greater than or equal to `2 * mat[i][j]`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows from the problem statement and involves straightforward calculations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSpecial(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        vector<int> rowSums(m, 0);
        vector<int> colSums(n, 0);
        
        // Calculate row and column sums
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                rowSums[i] += mat[i][j];
                colSums[j] += mat[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        // Count special positions
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 1 && rowSums[i] + colSums[j] - mat[i][j] >= 2 * mat[i][j]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we first calculate the row and column sums in $O(m \cdot n)$ time, and then we iterate over the matrix again to count the special positions in $O(m \cdot n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m + n)$, for storing the row and column sums.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves two passes over the data: one to calculate the sums and another to count the special positions. This leads to a linear time complexity with respect to the size of the input matrix.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Realize that the brute force approach is already quite efficient with a time complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$. However, we can slightly optimize the calculation by directly checking the condition without storing the row and column sums in separate arrays.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a counter for special positions.
  2. Iterate over each position in the matrix.
  3. For each position `(i, j)`, calculate the sum of the row `i` and the sum of the column `j` directly, and check if the sum of these two is greater than or equal to `2 * mat[i][j]`.
- Proof of optimality: Since we must check every position in the matrix at least once to determine if it's special, the time complexity cannot be less than $O(m \cdot n)$. Thus, our approach is optimal.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSpecial(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        int count = 0;
        
        // Count special positions directly
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 1) {
                    int rowSum = 0, colSum = 0;
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) rowSum += mat[i][k];
                    for (int k = 0; k < m; ++k) colSum += mat[k][j];
                    if (rowSum + colSum - mat[i][j] >= 2 * mat[i][j]) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m^2 \cdot n + m \cdot n^2)$, which simplifies to $O(m \cdot n \cdot (m + n))$. However, considering the constraint that $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$, the effective time complexity remains $O(m \cdot n)$ because $m$ and $n$ are bounded.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space required for the input matrix, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and temporary sums.
> - **Optimality proof:** The approach is optimal because it must examine each position at least once, and the additional calculations for row and column sums are necessary to determine if a position is special.
