## Make Object Immutable
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/make-object-immutable/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem requires making an object immutable. The object is passed as a parameter to a function. The function should return the immutable object.
- Expected output format: The output should be the immutable object.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The object's properties should not be modifiable after the function returns.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if the input object is `{a: 1, b: 2}`, the function should return an object that cannot be modified.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One way to make an object immutable is to create a new object and freeze it using the `Object.freeze()` method.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a new object using the `Object.assign()` method.
  2. Freeze the new object using the `Object.freeze()` method.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and uses built-in JavaScript methods to create and freeze a new object.

```cpp
// Note: The problem is in JavaScript, not C++. However, I'll provide a C++ equivalent.
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

class ImmutableObject {
public:
    ImmutableObject(const std::unordered_map<std::string, int>& obj) : obj_(obj) {}

    // Disallow modification
    void operator[](const std::string& key) const = delete;

    // Allow read access
    int get(const std::string& key) const {
        if (obj_.find(key) != obj_.end()) {
            return obj_.at(key);
        }
        throw std::out_of_range("Key not found");
    }

private:
    const std::unordered_map<std::string, int> obj_;
};

ImmutableObject makeImmutable(const std::unordered_map<std::string, int>& obj) {
    return ImmutableObject(obj);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of properties in the object, because we're creating a new object with the same properties.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we're storing a copy of the object's properties.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** We're creating a new object and copying the properties from the original object to the new object.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach, as it's already efficient and straightforward.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: We create a new object and freeze it using the `Object.freeze()` method (or its C++ equivalent).
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it creates a new object with the same properties as the original object and makes it immutable.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we need to create a new object to make it immutable, and we need to copy the properties from the original object to the new object.

```cpp
// Same as the brute force approach
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of properties in the object.

> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we need to create a new object and copy the properties from the original object to the new object.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Creating an immutable object by copying properties from an original object.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using built-in methods to create and freeze a new object.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, as the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Creating immutable arrays or other data structures.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not creating a new object, or not freezing the new object.
- Edge cases to watch for: Objects with nested properties or objects with functions as properties.
- Performance pitfalls: Creating a new object with a large number of properties can be slow.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different types of objects, including objects with nested properties or objects with functions as properties.
