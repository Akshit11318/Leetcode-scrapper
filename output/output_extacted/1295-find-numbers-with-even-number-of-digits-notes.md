## Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-numbers-with-even-number-of-digits/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq nums.length \leq 1000$, $1 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^5$ for all $i$.
- Expected output: The count of numbers with an even number of digits.
- Key requirements: Identify numbers with an even number of digits and count them.
- Edge cases: Handling numbers with leading zeros is not applicable since they are integers.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]`, Output: `2` (Explanation: The numbers with even number of digits are 12 and 7896).
- Input: `nums = [555,901,482,1771]`, Output: `1` (Explanation: Only 482 has an even number of digits).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To determine if a number has an even number of digits, we can convert each number into a string and check its length.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of numbers with an even number of digits.
  2. Iterate over each number in the input array.
  3. For each number, convert it into a string to easily determine its length (i.e., the number of digits).
  4. Check if the length of the string is even. If it is, increment the counter.
  5. After iterating over all numbers, return the counter as the result.

```cpp
int findNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        string str = to_string(num);
        if (str.length() % 2 == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums` and $m$ is the average number of digits in the numbers. This is because for each number, we are converting it to a string and checking its length.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input and output. The space used does not grow with the size of the input, making it constant.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the iteration over the input array and the string conversion and length check for each number. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the count and other variables, regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of converting each number to a string to count its digits, we can use mathematical operations to achieve the same result more efficiently.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a counter variable as before.
  2. Iterate over each number in the input array.
  3. For each number, calculate the number of digits by using the logarithm base 10. The number of digits in a number $x$ is given by $\lfloor\log_{10}x\rfloor + 1$ for $x > 0$.
  4. Check if the calculated number of digits is even. If it is, increment the counter.
  5. After iterating over all numbers, return the counter as the result.

```cpp
int findNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 0) continue; // Handle the special case of 0
        int digits = floor(log10(num)) + 1;
        if (digits % 2 == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we iterate over the input array once, and the operations inside the loop (logarithm and modulo) are constant time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, for the same reasons as the brute force approach.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to count the digits of each number, leveraging the mathematical property of logarithms to achieve a constant time complexity per number.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of considering different data types and operations (e.g., string conversion vs. mathematical operations) when approaching a problem.
- Understanding the properties of logarithms and how they can be applied to count digits in numbers.
- Recognizing that sometimes, what seems like an optimal approach at first glance can be improved upon with further analysis and insight.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the implications of data type conversions on performance.
- Overlooking mathematical properties that can simplify a problem.
- Failing to handle edge cases, such as the number 0 in this problem.
