## Find the Longest Equal Subarray
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-longest-equal-subarray/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array `nums` of integers, find the longest subarray that has an equal number of 0s and 1s.
- Expected output format: Return the length of the longest subarray that has an equal number of 0s and 1s.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle arrays with varying lengths and compositions of 0s and 1s. Consider the case where no such subarray exists.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - Input: `nums = [0,1]`
      Output: `2`
      Explanation: The longest subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is `[0,1]`.
    - Input: `nums = [0,1,0]`
      Output: `2`
      Explanation: The longest subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is `[0,1]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the longest subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s, we can check every possible subarray and count the occurrences of 0s and 1s in each.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Iterate through the array to consider each element as a potential start of a subarray.
    2. For each start position, iterate through the remaining elements to consider all possible end positions for the subarray.
    3. For each subarray, count the number of 0s and 1s.
    4. If the counts are equal, update the maximum length found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive approach to ensure no potential subarray is missed.

```cpp
int findMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxLength = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        int zeros = 0, ones = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
            if (nums[j] == 0) zeros++;
            else ones++;
            if (zeros == ones) {
                maxLength = max(maxLength, j - i + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, because for each element, we potentially scan the rest of the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the input array, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the counts and the maximum length.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The nested loops cause the quadratic time complexity, while the constant space usage is due to only using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of counting the occurrences of 0s and 1s in each subarray, we can use a single pass through the array and keep track of the difference between the counts of 0s and 1s. When this difference becomes 0, it means we have found a subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Initialize a map to store the cumulative sum of the array elements (considering 0 as -1 and 1 as 1) and their indices.
    2. Initialize the cumulative sum and the maximum length.
    3. Iterate through the array, updating the cumulative sum.
    4. If the cumulative sum is already in the map, it means we've found a subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s, so update the maximum length.
    5. If the cumulative sum is 0, it means the subarray from the start to the current index has an equal number of 0s and 1s, so update the maximum length.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures we only make a single pass through the array, resulting in linear time complexity, which is optimal for this problem.

```cpp
int findMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> sumToIndex;
    sumToIndex[0] = -1; // For the case when the entire array has equal 0s and 1s
    int maxLength = 0, cumulativeSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        cumulativeSum += (nums[i] == 0) ? -1 : 1;
        if (sumToIndex.find(cumulativeSum) != sumToIndex.end()) {
            maxLength = max(maxLength, i - sumToIndex[cumulativeSum]);
        } else {
            sumToIndex[cumulativeSum] = i;
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, because we make a single pass through the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, every cumulative sum could be unique, requiring space proportional to the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it achieves linear time complexity, which is the best possible for this problem given that we must at least read the input once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Hashing, cumulative sums, and the importance of single-pass algorithms for efficiency.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a map to store intermediate results and leveraging the properties of cumulative sums to identify patterns in the data.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by avoiding nested loops and using a single pass through the data.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the longest palindromic subarray, longest increasing subsequence, etc.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to handle edge cases, such as an empty input array or arrays with a single element.
- Edge cases to watch for: Arrays with all 0s or all 1s, and arrays where no subarray has an equal number of 0s and 1s.
- Performance pitfalls: Using brute force approaches for large inputs, which can lead to unacceptable execution times.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with a variety of inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness and efficiency.
