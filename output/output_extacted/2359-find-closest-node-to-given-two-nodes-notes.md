## Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-node-to-given-two-nodes/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes in a `node1` and a `node2` as input, along with the number of nodes `n` and an array `nodeValues` representing the values of each node in a graph.
- Expected output format: The function should return the index of the closest node to both `node1` and `node2`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The closest node is defined as the node with the minimum sum of distances to `node1` and `node2`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For instance, if `nodeValues = [2,5,9], node1 = 0, node2 = 1`, the closest node to both `node1` and `node2` would be the one with index `0`, since the sum of distances from `node1` to `node1` and `node2` to `node1` is `0 + 1 = 1`, which is the minimum sum of distances.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating through all nodes in the graph and calculating the sum of distances from each node to `node1` and `node2`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize the minimum sum of distances and the index of the closest node.
  2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
  3. For each node, calculate the sum of distances to `node1` and `node2`.
  4. Update the minimum sum of distances and the index of the closest node if the current sum is smaller.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be efficient for large graphs.

```cpp
int closestMeetingNode(vector<int>& nodeValues, int node1, int node2) {
    int n = nodeValues.size();
    int minSum = INT_MAX;
    int closestNode = -1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int sum = abs(i - node1) + abs(i - node2);
        if (sum < minSum) {
            minSum = sum;
            closestNode = i;
        }
    }
    
    return closestNode;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because we iterate through each node once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum sum and the index of the closest node.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a constant amount of work for each node, and the space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that grow with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can take advantage of the fact that the closest node to both `node1` and `node2` will have the minimum sum of distances to `node1` and `node2`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the minimum sum of distances and the index of the closest node.
  2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
  3. For each node, calculate the sum of distances to `node1` and `node2` using the absolute difference between the indices.
  4. Update the minimum sum of distances and the index of the closest node if the current sum is smaller.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a linear time complexity and uses a constant amount of space.

```cpp
int closestMeetingNode(vector<int>& nodeValues, int node1, int node2) {
    int n = nodeValues.size();
    int minSum = INT_MAX;
    int closestNode = -1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nodeValues[i] != nodeValues[node1] && nodeValues[i] != nodeValues[node2]) {
            continue;
        }
        int sum = abs(i - node1) + abs(i - node2);
        if (sum < minSum) {
            minSum = sum;
            closestNode = i;
        }
    }
    
    return closestNode;
}
```
