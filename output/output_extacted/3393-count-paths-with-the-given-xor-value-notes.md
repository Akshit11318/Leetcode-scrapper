## Count Paths with the Given Xor Value

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-paths-with-the-given-xor-value/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an array `edges` of pairs of nodes in a tree and a target XOR value `target`, count the number of paths from any node to any other node such that the XOR of the node values along the path equals `target`.
- Input format: `edges` as a list of pairs of integers representing node connections, `target` as an integer representing the target XOR value.
- Expected output format: An integer representing the count of paths with the given XOR value.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cycles is not necessary as the input forms a tree, and considering paths that start and end at the same node.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Given `edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]]` and `target = 1`, the output should be `4` because there are four paths with XOR `1`: `[0, 1]`, `[0, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3]`, and `[2, 4, 3]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible path in the tree and calculating the XOR of node values along each path.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible paths in the tree using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).
  2. For each path, calculate the XOR of the node values.
  3. Check if the calculated XOR equals the target value. If so, increment the count of paths.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward and ensures that all paths are considered.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int countPaths(vector<vector<int>>& edges, int target) {
    // Construct the tree from edges
    vector<vector<int>> tree(edges.size());
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        tree[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        tree[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }

    int count = 0;
    // Function to generate all paths and count those with target XOR
    function<void(int, int, int, vector<int>&)> dfs = 
    [&](int node, int parent, int currentXor, vector<int>& path) {
        path.push_back(node);
        currentXor ^= node;
        
        if (currentXor == target) count++;
        
        for (int child : tree[node]) {
            if (child != parent) {
                dfs(child, node, currentXor, path);
            }
        }
        
        path.pop_back();
    };

    vector<int> path;
    dfs(0, -1, 0, path);
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N \cdot 2^N)$ where $N$ is the number of nodes, as in the worst case, we explore all possible subsets of nodes.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$ for storing the tree and the current path.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach explores all possible paths, leading to exponential time complexity, and stores the tree and a path, resulting in linear space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of generating all paths, we can use a hash map to store the XOR values of paths from the root to each node and then calculate the XOR of each pair of paths to check if it equals the target.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Perform a DFS from the root node, calculating the XOR of node values along each path.
  2. Use a hash map to store the count of each XOR value encountered.
  3. For each node, calculate the XOR of the path from the root to the current node.
  4. Check if the hash map contains the value that, when XORed with the current path's XOR, equals the target. If so, increment the count by the number of times this value appears in the hash map.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(N)$, which is the best possible as we must visit each node at least once.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int countPaths(vector<vector<int>>& edges, int target) {
    vector<vector<int>> tree(edges.size());
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        tree[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        tree[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }

    int count = 0;
    unordered_map<int, int> xorCount;
    xorCount[0] = 1; // For the root node

    function<void(int, int, int)> dfs = 
    [&](int node, int parent, int currentXor) {
        currentXor ^= node;
        
        // Check if there's a path with XOR equal to target
        count += xorCount[currentXor ^ target];
        
        // Update the count of the current XOR
        xorCount[currentXor]++;
        
        for (int child : tree[node]) {
            if (child != parent) {
                dfs(child, node, currentXor);
            }
        }
        
        // Backtrack
        xorCount[currentXor]--;
    };

    dfs(0, -1, 0);
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$ where $N$ is the number of nodes, as we visit each node once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$ for storing the tree and the hash map.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we visit each node exactly once, achieving linear time complexity, which is the best possible for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Depth-First Search (DFS), hash map usage for efficient counting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using DFS to explore trees, optimizing path counting with hash maps.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing time complexity from exponential to linear by avoiding redundant calculations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving tree traversals and path counting, such as finding the number of paths with a given sum.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling the root node correctly in the hash map, forgetting to backtrack and update counts.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty trees, trees with a single node, and ensuring all nodes are reachable from the root.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient data structures or algorithms that lead to high time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Ensuring the solution works for small and large inputs, edge cases, and verifying the correctness of the count.
