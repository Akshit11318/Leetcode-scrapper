## Maximal Square

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D binary array `matrix` containing `0`s and `1`s, where `0` represents an empty space and `1` represents a filled space.
- Constraints: The input matrix can be empty, and the number of rows and columns can vary.
- Expected output format: The area of the largest square that can be formed using the filled spaces in the matrix.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling empty matrices
  - Matrices with a single row or column
  - Matrices with all `0`s or all `1`s
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - A matrix with a single filled square
  - A matrix with multiple filled squares of different sizes
  - A matrix with no filled squares

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves checking every possible square in the matrix to see if it can be formed using filled spaces.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over every cell in the matrix.
  2. For each cell, check all possible square sizes that can be formed with the cell as the top-left corner.
  3. For each square size, check if all cells within the square are filled.
  4. If a square is found, update the maximum area.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach that checks every possible solution.

```cpp
int maximalSquare(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
    if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) return 0;
    int rows = matrix.size();
    int cols = matrix[0].size();
    int maxArea = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            for (int size = 1; size <= min(rows - i, cols - j); size++) {
                bool isSquare = true;
                for (int x = 0; x < size; x++) {
                    for (int y = 0; y < size; y++) {
                        if (matrix[i + x][j + y] == '0') {
                            isSquare = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    if (!isSquare) break;
                }
                if (isSquare) {
                    maxArea = max(maxArea, size * size);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix. This is because we have four nested loops: two to iterate over the cells, one to iterate over the possible square sizes, and one to check if the square is filled.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum area and the current square size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity because it checks every possible square in the matrix. The space complexity is low because we only need to store a few variables to keep track of the maximum area.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal approach involves using dynamic programming to store the size of the largest square that can be formed at each cell.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` with the same size as the input matrix, where `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square that can be formed at cell `(i, j)`.
  2. Initialize the first row and column of `dp` based on the input matrix.
  3. For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix, update `dp[i][j]` to be the minimum of `dp[i-1][j]`, `dp[i][j-1]`, and `dp[i-1][j-1]` plus 1, if the current cell is filled.
  4. Update the maximum area based on the values in `dp`.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it only needs to check each cell once and stores the result in the `dp` array, reducing the time complexity to $O(n^2)$.

```cpp
int maximalSquare(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
    if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) return 0;
    int rows = matrix.size();
    int cols = matrix[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(rows, vector<int>(cols, 0));
    int maxArea = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] == '1') {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min(min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]), dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1;
                }
                maxArea = max(maxArea, dp[i][j] * dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, memoization, and optimization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems, using memoization to store intermediate results, and optimizing the solution using dynamic programming.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity, and memoization to store intermediate results.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the longest common subsequence problem or the knapsack problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` array correctly, or not updating the maximum area correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty matrices, matrices with a single row or column, and matrices with all `0`s or all `1`s.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using memoization or dynamic programming, which can lead to high time complexities.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input matrices, including edge cases and large matrices.
