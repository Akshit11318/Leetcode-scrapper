## Predict the Winner

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/predict-the-winner/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers representing scores.
- Constraints: The length of the array is between 1 and 20.
- Expected output format: A boolean indicating whether the first player will win.
- Key requirements: The first player can choose any score from the array, and the second player will try to minimize the difference. The game continues until all scores have been chosen.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `[1, 5, 2]`
  - Output: `true`
  - Explanation: The first player can choose the score 5, leaving the second player with a total score of 3. The first player will win.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of scores for the first player and calculate the maximum difference that can be achieved.
- The brute force approach involves recursively trying all possible moves for the first player and calculating the minimum difference that the second player can achieve.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool PredictTheWinner(vector<int>& nums) {
        return helper(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1) >= 0;
    }
    
    int helper(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        if (start == end) {
            return nums[start];
        }
        
        int chooseStart = nums[start] - helper(nums, start + 1, end);
        int chooseEnd = nums[end] - helper(nums, start, end - 1);
        
        return max(chooseStart, chooseEnd);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are trying all possible combinations of scores.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, which is the maximum depth of the recursion call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations of scores, resulting in exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
- The optimal approach involves creating a 2D array to store the maximum difference that can be achieved for each subarray.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool PredictTheWinner(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = nums[i];
        }
        
        for (int length = 1; length < n; length++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - length; i++) {
                int j = i + length;
                dp[i][j] = max(nums[i] - dp[i + 1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n - 1] >= 0;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are filling up a 2D array of size $n \times n$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, which is the size of the 2D array.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach has a polynomial time complexity, which is much better than the brute force approach. This is because we are avoiding redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems in a 2D array.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: dynamic programming, recursion, and memoization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively.
- Optimization techniques learned: using dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
- Similar problems to practice: other problems that involve dynamic programming and recursion, such as the `Min Cost Climbing Stairs` problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not handling edge cases correctly, not initializing variables properly.
- Edge cases to watch for: arrays with a single element, arrays with two elements.
- Performance pitfalls: using the brute force approach for large inputs, not using dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems.
- Testing considerations: testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases and large inputs.
