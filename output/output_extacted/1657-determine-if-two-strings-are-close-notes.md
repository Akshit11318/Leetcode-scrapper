## Determine if Two Strings are Close
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two strings `word1` and `word2`.
- Constraints: Each string consists of lowercase letters and has a length between 1 and 10.
- Expected Output: Return `true` if the two strings are close, and `false` otherwise. Two strings are close if they have the same set of characters, and the frequency of each character in one string is within one of the frequency of the same character in the other string.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases:**
- Handle strings with different lengths.
- Consider cases where a character appears more than once in one string but not at all in the other.
- Handle empty strings or strings with a single character.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"`: Returns `true` because both strings have the same set of characters and the frequency of each character in one string is the same as in the other.
- `word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"`: Returns `false` because the frequency of 'a' in `word1` is not within one of the frequency of 'a' in `word2`.
- `word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"`: Returns `true` because both strings have the same set of characters and the frequency of each character in one string is within one of the frequency of the same character in the other string.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- First, we need to count the frequency of each character in both strings.
- Then, we compare the frequencies of each character in both strings to check if they are within one of each other.
- If we find any character that does not meet this condition, we immediately return `false`.
- If we finish checking all characters without finding any that do not meet the condition, we return `true`.

```cpp
bool closeStrings(string word1, string word2) {
    // Check if the two strings have the same length
    if (word1.length() != word2.length()) return false;

    // Count the frequency of each character in both strings
    map<char, int> count1, count2;
    for (char c : word1) count1[c]++;
    for (char c : word2) count2[c]++;

    // Check if the two strings have the same set of characters
    if (count1.size() != count2.size()) return false;
    for (auto& p : count1) {
        if (count2.find(p.first) == count2.end()) return false;
    }

    // Check if the frequency of each character in one string is within one of the frequency of the same character in the other string
    vector<int> freq1, freq2;
    for (auto& p : count1) freq1.push_back(p.second);
    for (auto& p : count2) freq2.push_back(p.second);
    sort(freq1.begin(), freq1.end());
    sort(freq2.begin(), freq2.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < freq1.size(); i++) {
        if (abs(freq1[i] - freq2[i]) > 1) return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of unique characters in the strings. This is because we sort the frequencies of characters in both strings.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of unique characters in the strings. This is because we store the frequencies of characters in both strings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we sort the frequencies of characters in both strings. The space complexity occurs because we store the frequencies of characters in both strings.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- We can optimize the previous approach by using a more efficient data structure to store the frequencies of characters in both strings.
- We can use a `vector` to store the frequencies of characters in both strings, and then sort the vectors.
- We can then compare the sorted vectors to check if the frequencies of characters in both strings are within one of each other.

```cpp
bool closeStrings(string word1, string word2) {
    // Check if the two strings have the same length
    if (word1.length() != word2.length()) return false;

    // Count the frequency of each character in both strings
    vector<int> count1(26), count2(26);
    for (char c : word1) count1[c - 'a']++;
    for (char c : word2) count2[c - 'a']++;

    // Check if the two strings have the same set of characters
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if ((count1[i] > 0) != (count2[i] > 0)) return false;
    }

    // Check if the frequency of each character in one string is within one of the frequency of the same character in the other string
    sort(count1.begin(), count1.end());
    sort(count2.begin(), count2.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (count1[i] != count2[i]) return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of unique characters in the strings. This is because we sort the frequencies of characters in both strings.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the frequencies of characters in both strings.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal approach because we only need to compare the frequencies of characters in both strings once, and we can do this in $O(n \log n)$ time using sorting.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: sorting, frequency counting, and string comparison.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using a more efficient data structure to store frequencies, and sorting to compare frequencies.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a fixed amount of space to store frequencies, and sorting to compare frequencies in $O(n \log n)$ time.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking for the same length of strings, not checking for the same set of characters, and not comparing frequencies correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: empty strings, strings with a single character, and strings with different lengths.
- Performance pitfalls: using an inefficient data structure to store frequencies, and not sorting frequencies before comparing them.
- Testing considerations: testing with different lengths of strings, testing with different sets of characters, and testing with different frequencies of characters.
