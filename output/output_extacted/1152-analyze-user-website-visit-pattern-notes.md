## Analyze User Website Visit Pattern

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/analyze-user-website-visit-pattern/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes a list of user visit patterns where each pattern is represented as a list of three elements: `username`, `timestamp`, and `website`. The task is to find the most visited website for each user.
- Expected output format: The output should be a list of the most visited website for each user.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input list may contain multiple visit patterns for the same user, and there may be ties in the visit counts for different websites. In case of a tie, the website with the lexicographically smallest name should be chosen.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For example, given `[["joe","09:00:00","google"],["joe","09:00:01","facebook"],["joe","09:00:02","google"]],` the output should be `["joe","google"]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to iterate through the list of visit patterns, count the visits for each user and website, and then find the most visited website for each user.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a dictionary to store the visit counts for each user and website.
  2. Iterate through the list of visit patterns and update the visit counts in the dictionary.
  3. For each user, find the website with the maximum visit count.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be efficient for large inputs.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

vector<string> mostVisitedPattern(vector<vector<string>>& username, vector<vector<string>>& timestamp, vector<vector<string>>& website) {
    unordered_map<string, unordered_map<string, int>> visitCounts;
    for (int i = 0; i < username.size(); i++) {
        string user = username[i][0];
        string site = website[i][0];
        visitCounts[user][site]++;
    }

    string mostVisitedUser;
    string mostVisitedSite;
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (auto& user : visitCounts) {
        for (auto& site : user.second) {
            if (site.second > maxCount) {
                maxCount = site.second;
                mostVisitedUser = user.first;
                mostVisitedSite = site.first;
            } else if (site.second == maxCount) {
                if (site.first < mostVisitedSite) {
                    mostVisitedSite = site.first;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return {mostVisitedUser, mostVisitedSite};
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of users and $m$ is the number of websites. This is because we iterate through the list of visit patterns and then through the dictionary of visit counts.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of users and $m$ is the number of websites. This is because we store the visit counts in a dictionary.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we use a dictionary to store the visit counts, which requires iterating through the list of visit patterns and then through the dictionary.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a dictionary to store the visit counts for each user and website, and then find the most visited website for each user.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a dictionary to store the visit counts for each user and website.
  2. Iterate through the list of visit patterns and update the visit counts in the dictionary.
  3. For each user, find the website with the maximum visit count.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot m)$, which is the minimum required to iterate through the list of visit patterns and find the most visited website for each user.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

vector<string> mostVisitedPattern(vector<vector<string>>& username, vector<vector<string>>& timestamp, vector<vector<string>>& website) {
    unordered_map<string, unordered_map<string, int>> visitCounts;
    for (int i = 0; i < username.size(); i++) {
        string user = username[i][0];
        string site = website[i][0];
        visitCounts[user][site]++;
    }

    string mostVisitedUser;
    string mostVisitedSite;
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (auto& user : visitCounts) {
        for (auto& site : user.second) {
            if (site.second > maxCount) {
                maxCount = site.second;
                mostVisitedUser = user.first;
                mostVisitedSite = site.first;
            } else if (site.second == maxCount) {
                if (site.first < mostVisitedSite) {
                    mostVisitedSite = site.first;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return {mostVisitedUser, mostVisitedSite};
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iterating through a list, using a dictionary to store visit counts, and finding the maximum value in a dictionary.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a dictionary to store visit counts and then finding the most visited website for each user.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a dictionary to store visit counts instead of iterating through the list of visit patterns multiple times.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the most visited website for each user in a list of visit patterns, finding the most popular item in a list of purchases.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the dictionary before using it, not checking for ties in the visit counts.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling ties in the visit counts, handling empty input lists.
- Performance pitfalls: Iterating through the list of visit patterns multiple times instead of using a dictionary to store visit counts.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input lists, testing for ties in the visit counts, testing for empty input lists.
