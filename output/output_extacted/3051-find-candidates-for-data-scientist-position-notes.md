## Find Candidates for Data Scientist Position

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-candidates-for-data-scientist-position/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem requires finding candidates for a data scientist position based on their skills. The input is a list of candidate IDs, names, and skills, along with the required skills for the position.
- Expected output format: The output should be a list of candidate IDs who possess all the required skills.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The problem requires handling cases where a candidate may have multiple skills, and the required skills may vary.
- Example test cases with explanations: For instance, if the required skills are `['Python', 'SQL']`, a candidate with skills `['Python', 'SQL', 'Java']` should be included in the output.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to iterate through each candidate and check if they possess all the required skills.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a list to store the IDs of candidates who possess all the required skills.
  2. Iterate through each candidate in the input list.
  3. For each candidate, iterate through each required skill.
  4. Check if the candidate possesses the required skill. If not, move on to the next candidate.
  5. If the candidate possesses all the required skills, add their ID to the output list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, making it a natural first choice.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

struct Candidate {
    int id;
    std::string name;
    std::vector<std::string> skills;
};

std::vector<int> findCandidates(std::vector<Candidate>& candidates, std::vector<std::string>& requiredSkills) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (const auto& candidate : candidates) {
        bool hasAllSkills = true;
        for (const auto& skill : requiredSkills) {
            bool hasSkill = false;
            for (const auto& candidateSkill : candidate.skills) {
                if (candidateSkill == skill) {
                    hasSkill = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!hasSkill) {
                hasAllSkills = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (hasAllSkills) {
            result.push_back(candidate.id);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of candidates, $m$ is the number of required skills, and $k$ is the average number of skills per candidate. This is because we iterate through each candidate, each required skill, and each skill of the candidate.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of candidates who possess all the required skills. This is because we store the IDs of these candidates in the output list.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because of the nested loops, and the space complexity occurs because of the output list.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a `std::unordered_set` to store the required skills for efficient lookup.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a `std::unordered_set` to store the required skills.
  2. Iterate through each candidate in the input list.
  3. For each candidate, create a `std::unordered_set` to store their skills.
  4. Check if the candidate's skills set is a superset of the required skills set. If so, add their ID to the output list.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a better time complexity than the brute force approach because it uses efficient set operations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

struct Candidate {
    int id;
    std::string name;
    std::vector<std::string> skills;
};

std::vector<int> findCandidates(std::vector<Candidate>& candidates, std::vector<std::string>& requiredSkills) {
    std::unordered_set<std::string> requiredSkillsSet(requiredSkills.begin(), requiredSkills.end());
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (const auto& candidate : candidates) {
        std::unordered_set<std::string> candidateSkillsSet(candidate.skills.begin(), candidate.skills.end());
        bool isSuperset = true;
        for (const auto& skill : requiredSkillsSet) {
            if (candidateSkillsSet.find(skill) == candidateSkillsSet.end()) {
                isSuperset = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isSuperset) {
            result.push_back(candidate.id);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot (m + k))$, where $n$ is the number of candidates, $m$ is the number of required skills, and $k$ is the average number of skills per candidate. This is because we iterate through each candidate and perform set operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k + m)$, where $n$ is the number of candidates, $k$ is the average number of skills per candidate, and $m$ is the number of required skills. This is because we store the skills sets for each candidate and the required skills.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses efficient set operations to minimize the time complexity.
