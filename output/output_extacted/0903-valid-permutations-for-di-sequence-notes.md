## Valid Permutations for DI Sequence

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-permutations-for-di-sequence/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes a string `s` consisting of characters 'D' and 'I' as input, where 'D' denotes decreasing and 'I' denotes increasing. The length of `s` is represented by `n`. The goal is to find the number of valid permutations of numbers from 1 to `n+1` that match the given sequence.
- Expected output format: The output should be the count of valid permutations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The sequence is valid if for every 'D', the number before it is greater, and for every 'I', the number before it is smaller. We need to consider all possible permutations and validate them against the given sequence.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `s = "DI"`, the valid permutations are `[2,1,3]`, `[3,1,2]`. For `s = "D"`, the valid permutations are `[2,1]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all permutations of numbers from 1 to `n+1` and then validate each permutation against the given sequence.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of numbers from 1 to `n+1`.
  2. For each permutation, iterate through the sequence and check if the permutation matches the sequence.
  3. If a permutation matches the sequence, increment the count of valid permutations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most straightforward approach to ensure that all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int numPermsDISequence(string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    int count = 0;
    
    vector<int> perm(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n + 1; i++) {
        perm[i - 1] = i;
    }
    
    do {
        bool isValid = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s[i] == 'D' && perm[i] <= perm[i + 1]) {
                isValid = false;
                break;
            }
            if (s[i] == 'I' && perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]) {
                isValid = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isValid) {
            count++;
        }
    } while (next_permutation(perm.begin(), perm.end()));
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O((n+1)!)$ because we generate all permutations of `n+1` numbers and validate each one.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the permutation.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** Generating all permutations leads to a factorial time complexity, and storing one permutation requires linear space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use dynamic programming to store the count of valid permutations for each prefix of the sequence.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the count of valid permutations for the sequence up to index `i` and the last number being `j`.
  2. For each number `j` from 1 to `n+1`, if the sequence is empty or the last character is 'I', update `dp[0][j]` to 1.
  3. For each character in the sequence, update `dp[i][j]` based on whether the character is 'D' or 'I'.
  4. The final answer is the sum of `dp[n][j]` for all `j`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach considers all possible valid permutations efficiently by avoiding redundant calculations through dynamic programming.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach already achieves the optimal time complexity by only considering necessary calculations.

```cpp
int numPermsDISequence(string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 2, 0));
    
    for (int j = 1; j <= n + 1; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = 1;
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n + 1; j++) {
            if (s[i - 1] == 'D') {
                for (int k = 1; k < j; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][k];
                }
            } else if (s[i - 1] == 'I') {
                for (int k = j + 1; k <= n + 1; k++) {
                    dp[i][k] += dp[i - 1][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    int count = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j <= n + 1; j++) {
        count += dp[n][j];
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot (n+1))$ because we fill up a 2D array of size $(n+1) \times (n+2)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot (n+1))$ for the 2D array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it efficiently considers all valid permutations by avoiding redundant calculations through dynamic programming.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, permutation generation, and sequence validation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and using dynamic programming to store intermediate results.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding redundant calculations and using efficient data structures.
- Similar problems to practice: Other sequence validation problems, such as validating parentheses or checking if a string is a palindrome.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly initializing the dynamic programming array or updating the array with incorrect values.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling empty sequences or sequences with only one character.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures that lead to high time or space complexities.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with different input sequences and edge cases to ensure correctness.
