## Is Subsequence
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is a subsequence of `s`, or `false` otherwise.
- A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
- Input format and constraints: `s` and `t` are strings consisting only of lowercase letters.
- Expected output format: A boolean value indicating whether `t` is a subsequence of `s`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - `s` and `t` can be empty strings.
  - `t` can be longer than `s`.
  - `s` and `t` can have repeated characters.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible subsequence of `s` to see if it matches `t`.
- This approach involves generating all possible subsequences of `s` and then comparing each one with `t`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward, albeit inefficient, way to solve the problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        // Function to generate all subsequences of a string
        vector<string> generateSubsequences(string str) {
            if (str.empty()) return {""};
            vector<string> subsequences;
            vector<string> sub = generateSubsequences(str.substr(1));
            subsequences.insert(subsequences.end(), sub.begin(), sub.end());
            for (auto& subsequence : sub) subsequences.push_back(str[0] + subsequence);
            return subsequences;
        }

        // Generate all subsequences of s
        vector<string> subsequences = generateSubsequences(s);
        
        // Check if t matches any of the subsequences
        for (auto& subsequence : subsequences) {
            if (subsequence == t) return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`. This is because we generate all possible subsequences of `s`, which is $2^n$ in the worst case (when all characters are included or excluded).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, as we store all generated subsequences.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible subsequences and then checking each one, leading to exponential time and space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can use two pointers to traverse `s` and `t` simultaneously, checking if the current character in `t` appears in `s` at or after the current position in `s`.
- Detailed breakdown: Initialize two pointers, `i` for `s` and `j` for `t`. Iterate through `s` and `t` using the two pointers. If the current characters in `s` and `t` match, move both pointers forward. If they do not match, move only the pointer for `s` forward. If we reach the end of `t` without returning `false`, it means `t` is a subsequence of `s`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through `s` and `t`, resulting in linear time complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.size() && j < t.size()) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) j++;
            i++;
        }
        return j == t.size();
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`. This is because we make a single pass through `s`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and do not allocate any additional space that scales with input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach has linear time complexity, which is the best possible complexity for this problem because we must at least read the input strings once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Two-pointer technique, string manipulation, and subsequence checking.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using pointers to traverse multiple sequences simultaneously and optimizing brute force approaches.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the number of operations by using a single pass through the input strings.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation and subsequence problems, such as longest common subsequence or edit distance.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Off-by-one errors when using pointers, not checking for edge cases like empty strings.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty strings, strings of different lengths, and strings with repeated characters.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms like generating all subsequences, which can lead to exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly test the function with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
