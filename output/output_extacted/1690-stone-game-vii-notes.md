## Stone Game VII
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-vii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `stones` representing the values of stones.
- Constraints: The length of `stones` is between 2 and 1000.
- Expected output format: The maximum possible score Alice can get.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The game ends when there are no more stones left, and the player with the higher score wins. If the scores are equal, Alice wins.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `stones = [5,3,1,2,4]`, Alice can get a maximum score of 18.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of stones and calculate the score for each combination.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Generate all possible subsets of the `stones` array.
  2. For each subset, calculate the sum of the stones and the sum of the prefixes.
  3. Update the maximum score if the current score is higher.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to solve the problem by considering all possible scenarios.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int stoneGameVII(vector<int>& stones) {
        int n = stones.size();
        int maxScore = 0;
        
        // Generate all possible subsets
        for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            int score = 0;
            int prefixSum = 0;
            
            // Calculate the sum of the stones and the sum of the prefixes
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    score += stones[i] - prefixSum;
                    prefixSum += stones[i];
                }
            }
            
            // Update the maximum score
            maxScore = max(maxScore, score);
        }
        
        return maxScore;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of stones. This is because we generate all possible subsets of the `stones` array and calculate the score for each subset.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum score and the current score.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we consider all possible subsets of the `stones` array, which has an exponential number of possibilities. The space complexity is low because we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum score and the current score.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to store the maximum score for each subarray of the `stones` array.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum score for each subarray.
  2. Fill the `dp` array using a bottom-up approach, considering all possible subarrays.
  3. The maximum score for the entire array is stored in the top-right corner of the `dp` array.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible subarrays and stores the maximum score for each subarray, avoiding redundant calculations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int stoneGameVII(vector<int>& stones) {
        int n = stones.size();
        vector<int> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
        
        // Calculate the prefix sum array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + stones[i];
        }
        
        // Initialize the dp array
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        // Fill the dp array using a bottom-up approach
        for (int length = 1; length <= n; length++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                if (length == 1) {
                    dp[i][j] = stones[i];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j] + prefixSum[j + 1] - prefixSum[i + 1], dp[i][j - 1] + prefixSum[j + 1] - prefixSum[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of stones. This is because we fill the `dp` array using a bottom-up approach, considering all possible subarrays.

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it considers all possible subarrays and stores the maximum score for each subarray, avoiding redundant calculations. The time complexity is quadratic because we fill the `dp` array using a bottom-up approach, and the space complexity is quadratic because we use a 2D array to store the maximum score for each subarray.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, prefix sum array.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, using a bottom-up approach to fill the `dp` array.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding redundant calculations by storing the maximum score for each subarray.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the Fibonacci sequence or the knapsack problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` array correctly, not considering all possible subarrays.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where the input array is empty or has only one element.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a naive approach that considers all possible subsets of the `stones` array, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input arrays, including edge cases and large inputs.
