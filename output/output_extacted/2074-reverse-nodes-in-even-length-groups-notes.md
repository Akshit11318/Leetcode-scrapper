## Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-even-length-groups/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: The head of a singly linked list.
- Constraints: The number of nodes in the list is in the range $[1, 10^4]$.
- Expected Output: The head of the modified linked list after reversing nodes in even length groups.
- Key Requirements:
  - Reverse nodes in groups of even lengths.
  - Groups are defined by the number of nodes in them, not by their position in the list.
- Example Test Cases:
  - Example 1: Input: head = [5,2,6,3,9,1,7,3,8,9], groupLength = 3. Output: [5,2,6,3,9,1,7,3,8,9].
  - Example 2: Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], groupLength = 2. Output: [1,2,3,4,5].

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to traverse the linked list and reverse each group of nodes of the specified length.
- To achieve this, we'll keep track of the current group size and when it matches the specified length, we reverse those nodes.
- We continue this process until we reach the end of the list.

```cpp
// Brute Force Approach
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseEvenLengthGroups(ListNode* head, int groupLength) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        ListNode* prev = dummy;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        int count = 0;
        
        while (curr) {
            count++;
            if (count == groupLength) {
                if (groupLength % 2 == 0) {
                    // Reverse the group of nodes
                    ListNode* nextGroup = curr->next;
                    ListNode* groupStart = prev->next;
                    reverseList(groupStart, groupLength);
                    prev->next = groupStart;
                    groupStart->next = nextGroup;
                }
                count = 0;
                prev = groupStart;
                curr = nextGroup;
            } else {
                curr = curr->next;
            }
        }
        
        return dummy->next;
    }
    
    void reverseList(ListNode* head, int length) {
        ListNode* prev = NULL;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            ListNode* nextTemp = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the linked list, because we potentially visit each node once for the reversal process.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the output, because we only use a constant amount of space to store pointers and variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we traverse the linked list once. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store our variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The optimal solution involves a similar approach to the brute force but with some optimizations.
- Instead of reversing the list every time we find a group of the specified length, we can directly reverse the nodes as we traverse the list, keeping track of the group size.
- This approach ensures we minimize the number of operations and maintain a linear time complexity.

```cpp
// Optimal Approach
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseEvenLengthGroups(ListNode* head, int groupLength) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        ListNode* prev = dummy;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        
        while (curr) {
            // Calculate the length of the current group
            ListNode* temp = curr;
            int length = 0;
            while (temp && length < groupLength) {
                temp = temp->next;
                length++;
            }
            
            if (length == groupLength) {
                // Reverse the current group
                ListNode* nextGroup = temp;
                ListNode* groupStart = curr;
                ListNode* groupPrev = NULL;
                for (int i = 0; i < groupLength; i++) {
                    ListNode* nextTemp = curr->next;
                    curr->next = groupPrev;
                    groupPrev = curr;
                    curr = nextTemp;
                }
                // Connect the reversed group to the rest of the list
                prev->next = groupPrev;
                groupStart->next = nextGroup;
                // Move to the next group
                prev = groupStart;
                curr = nextGroup;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated include linked list traversal and reversal.
- Problem-solving patterns identified include breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems (reversing groups of nodes) and optimizing the solution by minimizing the number of operations.
- Optimization techniques learned include reducing the number of reversals by directly reversing nodes as we traverse the list.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors include incorrect handling of edge cases (e.g., when the list has fewer nodes than the group length) and not properly reconnecting the reversed groups to the rest of the list.
- Performance pitfalls include unnecessary traversals or reversals that can increase the time complexity.
- Testing considerations include ensuring that the solution works correctly for lists of varying lengths and group sizes, including edge cases like an empty list or a group size of 1.
