## Infinite Method Object

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/infinite-method-object/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an object with methods and a method name, determine if the object can call a method on itself repeatedly without stopping.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if the object can call a method on itself repeatedly without stopping, otherwise return `false`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The object can have multiple methods, and each method can call other methods. The object can also have a `toString` method.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - An object with a single method that calls itself should return `true`.
  - An object with multiple methods where each method calls another method should return `true` if there is a cycle, otherwise return `false`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can use a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the object's methods and detect cycles.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a set to keep track of visited methods.
  2. Define a helper function to perform DFS.
  3. In the helper function, check if the current method is already visited. If yes, return `true`.
  4. Mark the current method as visited.
  5. Iterate over the methods of the object and recursively call the helper function.
  6. If no cycle is found, return `false`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCyclic(Object obj) {
        unordered_set<string> visited;
        return dfs(obj, visited, "toString");
    }
    
    bool dfs(Object obj, unordered_set<string>& visited, string methodName) {
        if (visited.find(methodName) != visited.end()) {
            return true;
        }
        visited.insert(methodName);
        
        // Assume we have a function to get the methods of an object
        vector<string> methods = getMethods(obj);
        for (string method : methods) {
            if (dfs(obj, visited, method)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of methods and $m$ is the number of calls between methods.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of methods.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we visit each method and each call once. The space complexity is linear because we store each method in the `visited` set.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a more efficient data structure, such as a graph, to represent the object's methods and their calls.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a graph where each node represents a method and each edge represents a call between methods.
  2. Use a cycle detection algorithm, such as Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, to detect cycles in the graph.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a more efficient data structure and algorithm to detect cycles.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCyclic(Object obj) {
        // Create a graph
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> graph;
        // Assume we have a function to get the methods of an object
        vector<string> methods = getMethods(obj);
        for (string method : methods) {
            // Assume we have a function to get the calls of a method
            vector<string> calls = getCalls(obj, method);
            graph[method] = calls;
        }
        
        // Use Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm
        for (string method : methods) {
            if (hasCycle(graph, method)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    bool hasCycle(unordered_map<string, vector<string>>& graph, string method) {
        unordered_set<string> visited;
        return dfs(graph, visited, method);
    }
    
    bool dfs(unordered_map<string, vector<string>>& graph, unordered_set<string>& visited, string method) {
        if (visited.find(method) != visited.end()) {
            return true;
        }
        visited.insert(method);
        
        for (string call : graph[method]) {
            if (dfs(graph, visited, call)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
