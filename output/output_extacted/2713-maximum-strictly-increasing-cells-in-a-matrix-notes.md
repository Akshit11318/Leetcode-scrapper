## Maximum Strictly Increasing Cells in a Matrix
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-strictly-increasing-cells-in-a-matrix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A 2D `int` array `matrix` where each cell contains a non-negative integer.
- Expected output: The maximum number of cells in a strictly increasing path from top-left to bottom-right.
- Key requirements:
  - A path can only move right or down.
  - Each cell must have a greater value than the previous cell in the path.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`
    - Output: `3`
  - Input: `matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]`
    - Output: `1`

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible paths and keep track of the longest strictly increasing path.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Define a recursive function to explore all paths.
  2. For each cell, try moving right and down, and update the maximum path length if a longer increasing path is found.
  3. Use a visited set to avoid revisiting cells and to ensure paths are strictly increasing.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxIncreasingCells(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        int maxPath = 0;
        
        // Define a recursive function to explore all paths
        function<void(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int i, int j, int pathLength) {
            maxPath = max(maxPath, pathLength);
            // Try moving right
            if (j + 1 < n && matrix[i][j + 1] > matrix[i][j]) {
                dfs(i, j + 1, pathLength + 1);
            }
            // Try moving down
            if (i + 1 < m && matrix[i + 1][j] > matrix[i][j]) {
                dfs(i + 1, j, pathLength + 1);
            }
        };
        
        // Start DFS from each cell
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                dfs(i, j, 1);
            }
        }
        
        return maxPath;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{m \times n})$ because in the worst case, we might explore all possible paths.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \times n)$ due to the recursive call stack and the visited set.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible paths, leading to exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Use dynamic programming to store the length of the longest increasing path ending at each cell.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a 2D `dp` array to store the length of the longest increasing path ending at each cell.
  2. Iterate through the matrix, updating `dp` values based on the maximum increasing path length from the top and left cells.
  3. The maximum value in the `dp` array represents the longest strictly increasing path.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxIncreasingCells(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 1));
        
        // Initialize dp values based on the first row and column
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            if (matrix[i][0] > matrix[i - 1][0]) {
                dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + 1;
            }
        }
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (matrix[0][j] > matrix[0][j - 1]) {
                dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Fill in the rest of the dp array
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] > matrix[i - 1][j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + 1);
                }
                if (matrix[i][j] > matrix[i][j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - 1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Find the maximum value in the dp array
        int maxPath = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                maxPath = max(maxPath, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
        
        return maxPath;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \times n)$ because we iterate through the matrix once to fill the `dp` array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \times n)$ due to the `dp` array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses dynamic programming to store and reuse the results of subproblems, avoiding redundant computations.

- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, pathfinding.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a `dp` array to store the length of the longest increasing path ending at each cell.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding redundant computations by storing and reusing subproblem results.
- Similar problems to practice: Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix, Longest Common Subsequence.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to initialize the `dp` array correctly, not handling edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty matrix, single-cell matrix.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach with exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test with different matrix sizes, including edge cases.
