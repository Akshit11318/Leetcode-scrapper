## Convert an Array into a 2D Array with Conditions

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-an-array-into-a-2d-array-with-conditions/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `threshold`, return the 2D array `result` where each row contains the elements of `nums` from index `i` to `i + k - 1` if the average of these elements is greater than or equal to `threshold`, otherwise, an empty array.
- Expected output format: A 2D array of integers.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where the window size `k` is larger than the remaining elements in the array, ensuring the average calculation is correct, and dealing with edge cases such as an empty input array.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `nums = [2,5,3,9,1]`, `k = 3`, and `threshold = 4`, the output should be `[[2,5,3],[5,3,9]]` because the averages of the first and second windows are greater than or equal to the threshold.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The simplest way to approach this problem is to iterate through the array with a sliding window of size `k`, calculate the average of the elements within the window, and if the average is greater than or equal to the threshold, add these elements to the result.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize an empty result array.
  2. Iterate through the input array with a sliding window of size `k`.
  3. For each window, calculate the sum of its elements.
  4. Calculate the average by dividing the sum by `k`.
  5. If the average is greater than or equal to the threshold, add the window elements to the result.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly implements the problem's requirements without considering optimizations.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> convertArray(vector<int>& nums, int k, int threshold) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    for (int i = 0; i <= nums.size() - k; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
            sum += nums[j];
        }
        int average = sum / k;
        if (average >= threshold) {
            vector<int> window(nums.begin() + i, nums.begin() + i + k);
            result.push_back(window);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array, because for each of the $n - k + 1$ windows, we perform $k$ operations to calculate the sum.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might store all elements of the input array in the result.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops, which lead to the time complexity. The space complexity is due to storing the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, we can maintain a running sum by subtracting the element going out of the window and adding the element entering the window. This reduces the time complexity of calculating the sum for each window from $O(k)$ to $O(1)$.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize the result array and a variable to keep track of the current window's sum.
  2. Calculate the sum of the first window and add it to the result if its average meets the threshold.
  3. Slide the window through the array, updating the sum by subtracting the outgoing element and adding the incoming one, and check the average for each window.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to calculate the sum for each window, reducing the overall time complexity to $O(n)$.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> convertArray(vector<int>& nums, int k, int threshold) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    if (nums.size() < k) return result;
    
    int windowSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        windowSum += nums[i];
    }
    
    if (windowSum / k >= threshold) {
        vector<int> window(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);
        result.push_back(window);
    }
    
    for (int i = k; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        windowSum = windowSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
        if (windowSum / k >= threshold) {
            vector<int> window(nums.begin() + i - k + 1, nums.begin() + i + 1);
            result.push_back(window);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array, because we process each element once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might store all elements of the input array in the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we only process each element once, minimizing the time complexity.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sliding window technique, maintaining a running sum to optimize calculations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Looking for opportunities to reduce redundant calculations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a running sum to reduce the time complexity of calculations within a sliding window.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving sliding windows, such as finding the maximum sum of a subarray of a given size.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to update the window sum correctly when sliding the window, not checking for edge cases such as an empty input array.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where the window size is larger than the input array, ensuring correct calculation of averages.
- Performance pitfalls: Recalculating sums from scratch for each window, leading to unnecessary complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with different window sizes, thresholds, and input arrays to ensure correctness.
