## Count the Hidden Sequences

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-hidden-sequences/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A binary string `s` of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
- Input format and constraints: `1 <= n <= 1000`, and `s` consists only of '0' and '1'.
- Expected output format: The number of hidden sequences in the binary string.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: A hidden sequence is defined as a sequence of three consecutive characters '0', '1', '0' in that order.
- Example test cases with explanations: For the input "001", the output is 1 because there is one hidden sequence "0 1 0". For "010", the output is 0 because there are no hidden sequences.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to iterate through the string and check every sequence of three characters to see if it matches the pattern '0', '1', '0'.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of hidden sequences found.
  2. Iterate through the string, considering each character as the starting point of a potential sequence.
  3. For each starting point, check if the next two characters (if they exist) form the sequence '0', '1', '0'.
  4. If a match is found, increment the counter.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most intuitive method, directly checking for the required pattern in the string.

```cpp
int countHiddenSequences(string s) {
    int count = 0; // Initialize count of hidden sequences
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size() - 2; i++) { // Iterate through the string
        if (s[i] == '0' && s[i + 1] == '1' && s[i + 2] == '0') { // Check for the sequence '0', '1', '0'
            count++; // Increment count if sequence is found
        }
    }
    return count; // Return the total count of hidden sequences
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string, because we are potentially checking every character in the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the count and the loop variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are iterating through the string once. The space complexity is constant because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is essentially the same as the brute force approach because the problem inherently requires checking every sequence of three characters in the string to identify all hidden sequences.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach remains to iterate through the string and check every sequence of three characters for the pattern '0', '1', '0'.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a linear time complexity, which is the best we can achieve given that we must potentially examine every character in the string.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is not possible because any algorithm must at least read the input, which takes linear time.

```cpp
int countHiddenSequences(string s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 2; i++) {
        if (s[i] == '0' && s[i + 1] == '1' && s[i + 2] == '0') {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because it achieves the best possible time complexity for this problem, which is linear.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Linear scanning and pattern matching.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The importance of understanding the problem constraints and identifying the minimal operations required to solve the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Recognizing when a brute force approach is actually optimal due to the inherent requirements of the problem.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string pattern matching problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Off-by-one errors in indexing, especially when checking sequences of characters.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty strings or strings shorter than 3 characters, which have no hidden sequences.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessarily complex data structures or algorithms that have higher time complexities than needed.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with strings of varying lengths and patterns to cover all edge cases.
