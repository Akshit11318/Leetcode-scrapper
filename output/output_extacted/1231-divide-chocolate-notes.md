## Divide Chocolate
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-chocolate/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-chocolate/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an array of integers `sweetness` and an integer `k`, where `sweetness` represents the sweetness of each piece of chocolate and `k` is the number of people to divide the chocolate among.
- Expected output format: The function should return the maximum minimum sweetness of chocolate each person can get.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The function should handle cases where the total number of pieces is less than `k`, and it should also handle cases where the total sweetness is less than `k`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `sweetness = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3`: The maximum minimum sweetness is 3, as the chocolate can be divided into `[1,2,3], [4], [5]`.
  - `sweetness = [5,6,7,8,9], k = 4`: The maximum minimum sweetness is 6, as the chocolate can be divided into `[5], [6], [7], [8,9]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves generating all possible combinations of dividing the chocolate into `k` pieces and calculating the minimum sweetness of each piece.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of dividing the chocolate into `k` pieces.
  2. Calculate the minimum sweetness of each piece in each combination.
  3. Keep track of the maximum minimum sweetness found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and involves generating all possible solutions and selecting the best one.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxMinSweetness(vector<int>& sweetness, int k) {
        int n = sweetness.size();
        int left = 1, right = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            right += sweetness[i];
        }
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right + 1) / 2;
            if (canDivide(sweetness, k, mid)) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    bool canDivide(vector<int>& sweetness, int k, int minSweetness) {
        int pieces = 0, currentSweetness = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < sweetness.size(); i++) {
            currentSweetness += sweetness[i];
            if (currentSweetness >= minSweetness) {
                pieces++;
                currentSweetness = 0;
            }
        }
        return pieces >= k + 1;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log S)$, where $n$ is the number of pieces of chocolate and $S$ is the total sweetness of all chocolate. This is because we use binary search to find the maximum minimum sweetness.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the left and right pointers.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we use binary search to find the maximum minimum sweetness, and the space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using binary search to find the maximum minimum sweetness.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the left and right pointers to 1 and the total sweetness of all chocolate, respectively.
  2. Use binary search to find the maximum minimum sweetness.
  3. In each iteration of the binary search, check if it is possible to divide the chocolate into `k` pieces with a minimum sweetness of `mid`.
  4. If it is possible, update the left pointer to `mid`. Otherwise, update the right pointer to `mid - 1`.
- Proof of optimality: The binary search approach is optimal because it reduces the search space by half in each iteration, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n \log S)$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxMinSweetness(vector<int>& sweetness, int k) {
        int n = sweetness.size();
        int left = 1, right = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            right += sweetness[i];
        }
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right + 1) / 2;
            if (canDivide(sweetness, k, mid)) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    bool canDivide(vector<int>& sweetness, int k, int minSweetness) {
        int pieces = 0, currentSweetness = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < sweetness.size(); i++) {
            currentSweetness += sweetness[i];
            if (currentSweetness >= minSweetness) {
                pieces++;
                currentSweetness = 0;
            }
        }
        return pieces >= k + 1;
    }
};
```

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the left and right pointers correctly, not updating the left and right pointers correctly in the binary search.
- Edge cases to watch for: Cases where the total number of pieces is less than `k`, cases where the total sweetness is less than `k`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that has a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
