## Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-distance-value-between-two-arrays/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, calculate the distance value between them, which is defined as the sum of `|arr1[i] - arr2[j]|` for all pairs `(i, j)` where `|arr1[i] - arr2[j]|` is less than or equal to `d`.
- Input format: Two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, and an integer `d`.
- Expected output format: The distance value between the two arrays.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The distance value should only include pairs where the absolute difference is less than or equal to `d`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `arr1 = [4, 5, 8], arr2 = [10, 9, 1, 8], d = 2`, expected output: `2 + 1 + 0 = 3`.
  - `arr1 = [2, 1, 100, 3], arr2 = [-5, -2, 10], d = 6`, expected output: `7`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to calculate the absolute difference between each element in `arr1` and each element in `arr2`.
- Then, check if this difference is less than or equal to `d`. If it is, add it to the total distance value.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly implements the problem statement without considering any optimizations.

```cpp
int findTheDistanceValue(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2, int d) {
    int distanceValue = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr1.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arr2.size(); j++) {
            int diff = abs(arr1[i] - arr2[j]);
            if (diff <= d) {
                distanceValue += diff;
            }
        }
    }
    return distanceValue;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the size of `arr1` and $m$ is the size of `arr2`, because we are iterating over each element in both arrays.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the distance value and loop counters.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The nested loops cause the time complexity to be quadratic in terms of the input sizes, while the space complexity remains constant because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach is the same as the brute force approach because the problem requires calculating the distance value for all pairs of elements where the absolute difference is less than or equal to `d`.
- There is no obvious way to reduce the number of comparisons needed, so the brute force approach is already optimal in terms of time complexity.
- However, the implementation can be slightly improved by using a more concise way to calculate the sum of absolute differences.

```cpp
int findTheDistanceValue(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2, int d) {
    int distanceValue = 0;
    for (auto& a : arr1) {
        for (auto& b : arr2) {
            if (abs(a - b) <= d) {
                distanceValue += abs(a - b);
            }
        }
    }
    return distanceValue;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the size of `arr1` and $m` is the size of `arr2`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are only using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we must check every pair of elements to calculate the distance value.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Brute force approach, absolute difference calculation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct implementation of problem statement.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, as the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving absolute differences or distance calculations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to check the condition `abs(a - b) <= d` before adding the difference to the distance value.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input arrays, `d` being a negative number (although the problem statement implies `d` is non-negative).
- Performance pitfalls: Using a more complex data structure or algorithm than necessary, which would increase the time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input sizes, including edge cases like empty arrays or `d` being 0.
