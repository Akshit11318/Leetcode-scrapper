## Minimum Moves to Make Array Complementary
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-make-array-complementary/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an array `nums` and an integer `limit`, find the minimum number of moves required to make the array complementary.
- The array is complementary if for every index `i`, the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[n - i - 1]` is within the range `[2, limit]`.
- In each move, you can increment or decrement any element of `nums`.
- The input array `nums` has a length of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- The integer `limit` is within the range `[3, 10^5]`.
- The array elements are within the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of moves required to make the array complementary.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases:**
- The array must be complementary after the minimum number of moves.
- The sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[n - i - 1]` must be within the range `[2, limit]` for every index `i`.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `nums = [1,2,4,3], limit = 4`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: In the first move, increment `nums[0]` to `2`. The array becomes `[2,2,4,3]`, which is complementary.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of increments and decrements for each element in the array.
- For each element, we can either increment or decrement it by a certain value to make the array complementary.
- We need to find the minimum number of moves required to make the array complementary.

```cpp
int minMoves(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int moves = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        vector<int> temp = nums;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i & (1 << j)) {
                temp[j]++;
                sum++;
            }
        }
        bool isComplementary = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < n / 2; j++) {
            if (temp[j] + temp[n - j - 1] < 2 || temp[j] + temp[n - j - 1] > limit) {
                isComplementary = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isComplementary) {
            moves = min(moves, sum);
        }
    }
    return moves;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because we are trying all possible combinations of increments and decrements for each element.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because we are creating a temporary array to store the modified elements.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are using a brute force approach, trying all possible combinations of increments and decrements. The space complexity occurs because we are creating a temporary array to store the modified elements.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a two-pointer technique to find the minimum number of moves required to make the array complementary.
- We can iterate through the array and for each pair of elements, calculate the minimum number of moves required to make their sum within the range `[2, limit]`.
- We can use a variable `moves` to keep track of the minimum number of moves required.

```cpp
int minMoves(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int moves = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
        int sum = nums[i] + nums[n - i - 1];
        if (sum < 2) {
            moves += 2 - sum;
        } else if (sum > limit) {
            moves += sum - limit;
        }
    }
    return moves;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because we are iterating through the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we are only iterating through the array once and calculating the minimum number of moves required for each pair of elements.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: two-pointer technique, iteration through the array.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: finding the minimum number of moves required to make the array complementary.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a variable to keep track of the minimum number of moves required.
- Similar problems to practice: finding the minimum number of moves required to make an array sorted, finding the minimum number of moves required to make an array complementary with a different limit.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not initializing the `moves` variable, not checking for the case where the sum of the pair of elements is less than 2 or greater than the limit.
- Edge cases to watch for: the case where the input array is empty, the case where the limit is less than 2.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach, not optimizing the solution by using a two-pointer technique.
- Testing considerations: testing the solution with different input arrays and limits, testing the solution with edge cases.
