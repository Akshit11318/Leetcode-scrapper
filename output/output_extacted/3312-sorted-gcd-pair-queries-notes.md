## Sorted GCD Pair Queries

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sorted-gcd-pair-queries/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of integers `nums`, the task is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) for each pair of elements in `nums` and return them in sorted order.
- Expected output format: A list of integers representing the GCDs of all pairs of elements in `nums`, sorted in ascending order.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. We need to consider all possible pairs of elements in `nums` and handle cases where `nums` contains duplicate elements or zero.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `nums = [2, 4, 6]`, the GCDs of all pairs are `[2, 2, 2]`, which is the sorted list of GCDs.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward approach is to calculate the GCD for each pair of elements in `nums` and store them in a list.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible pairs of elements in `nums`.
  2. For each pair, calculate the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
  3. Store the GCDs in a list.
  4. Sort the list of GCDs in ascending order.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most straightforward and intuitive way to solve the problem, as it directly addresses the requirement to find the GCDs of all pairs of elements.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

std::vector<int> gcdOfPairs(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<int> gcds;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            int gcd = std::gcd(nums[i], nums[j]);
            gcds.push_back(gcd);
        }
    }
    std::sort(gcds.begin(), gcds.end());
    return gcds;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \log n + n^2 \log n) = O(n^2 \log n)$, where $n$ is the size of `nums`. The first term accounts for generating all pairs and calculating their GCDs using the Euclidean algorithm, which has a time complexity of $O(\log n)$ for each pair. The second term accounts for sorting the list of GCDs.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, as we need to store the GCDs of all pairs of elements.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity due to generating all possible pairs of elements and calculating their GCDs, as well as sorting the resulting list.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of calculating the GCD for each pair of elements separately, we can use the fact that the GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. We can also use the fact that the GCD of a list of numbers is the GCD of the GCD of the first two numbers and the rest of the list.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Generate all possible pairs of elements in `nums`.
  2. For each pair, calculate the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
  3. Store the GCDs in a list.
  4. Sort the list of GCDs in ascending order.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n^2 \log n)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem. The space complexity is also optimal, as we need to store the GCDs of all pairs of elements.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we need to generate all possible pairs of elements and calculate their GCDs, which has a time complexity of $O(n^2 \log n)$. We also need to store the GCDs of all pairs of elements, which has a space complexity of $O(n^2)$.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

std::vector<int> gcdOfPairs(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<int> gcds;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            int gcd = std::gcd(nums[i], nums[j]);
            gcds.push_back(gcd);
        }
    }
    std::sort(gcds.begin(), gcds.end());
    return gcds;
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has the best possible time and space complexities for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The Euclidean algorithm for calculating the GCD of two numbers, and the concept of generating all possible pairs of elements in a list.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be solved by generating all possible pairs of elements, calculating their GCDs, and sorting the resulting list.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimal approach uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of each pair of elements, which has a time complexity of $O(\log n)$.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve calculating the GCD of a list of numbers, such as finding the GCD of a list of integers or finding the LCM of a list of integers.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling the case where `nums` contains duplicate elements or zero.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where `nums` contains only one element, or the case where `nums` contains only zero.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a naive approach to calculate the GCD of each pair of elements, which can have a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, such as lists of integers with different sizes and contents.
