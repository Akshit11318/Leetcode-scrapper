## Longest Even Odd Subarray with Threshold

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-even-odd-subarray-with-threshold/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq nums.length \leq 10^5$, $0 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^5$, $0 \leq threshold \leq 10^5$.
- Expected output format: the length of the longest subarray where the difference between the sum of elements at even indices and the sum of elements at odd indices is less than or equal to the threshold.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling empty arrays or arrays with a single element.
  - Ensuring the difference calculation is correct for both even and odd indices.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `threshold = 3`, the longest subarray that satisfies the condition is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` with a length of 5.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible subarray to see if the difference between the sum of its even-indexed elements and the sum of its odd-indexed elements is within the threshold.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible subarrays of the input array.
  2. For each subarray, calculate the sum of elements at even indices and the sum of elements at odd indices.
  3. Check if the absolute difference between these two sums is less than or equal to the threshold.
  4. Keep track of the longest subarray that satisfies this condition.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int longestSubarray(std::vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
    int maxLength = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= nums.size(); ++j) {
            std::vector<int> subarray(nums.begin() + i, nums.begin() + j);
            int evenSum = 0, oddSum = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < subarray.size(); ++k) {
                if (k % 2 == 0) {
                    evenSum += subarray[k];
                } else {
                    oddSum += subarray[k];
                }
            }
            if (std::abs(evenSum - oddSum) <= threshold) {
                maxLength = std::max(maxLength, (int)subarray.size());
            }
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is because for each of the $n$ elements, we generate $n$ subarrays and for each subarray, we potentially iterate over all its elements to calculate the sums.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might need to store a subarray of the same size as the input array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible subarrays and then performing calculations on each one, leading to high time complexity. The space complexity is due to the need to store each subarray.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of elements at even and odd indices for any subarray, reducing the need for redundant calculations.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Calculate prefix sums for even and odd indices separately.
  2. Use these prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of elements at even and odd indices for any subarray.
  3. Iterate through all possible subarrays and use the prefix sums to check if the condition is met.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int longestSubarray(std::vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> evenPrefix(n + 1, 0), oddPrefix(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            evenPrefix[i + 1] = evenPrefix[i] + nums[i];
            oddPrefix[i + 1] = oddPrefix[i];
        } else {
            evenPrefix[i + 1] = evenPrefix[i];
            oddPrefix[i + 1] = oddPrefix[i] + nums[i];
        }
    }
    int maxLength = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            int evenSum = evenPrefix[j] - evenPrefix[i];
            int oddSum = oddPrefix[j] - oddPrefix[i];
            if (std::abs(evenSum - oddSum) <= threshold) {
                maxLength = std::max(maxLength, j - i);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we iterate over all possible subarrays once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we need to store the prefix sums for even and odd indices.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to calculate the sums for all subarrays, leveraging the prefix sum technique to avoid redundant calculations.
