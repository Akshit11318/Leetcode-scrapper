## Find Latest Group of Size M
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-latest-group-of-size-m/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `nums` representing the initial sizes of the groups, and an integer `m` representing the target size of the group.
- Expected Output: The latest time at which a group of size `m` can be formed.
- Key Requirements and Edge Cases:
  - The input array `nums` can have any number of elements, and each element can be any non-negative integer.
  - The target size `m` can be any positive integer.
  - If no group of size `m` can be formed, return `-1`.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `nums = [3,5,2,6], m = 5` -> `2` (at time 2, the groups are `[3,5,2,6]`, and a group of size 5 can be formed by merging the second and third groups)
  - `nums = [2,1,3], m = 3` -> `2` (at time 2, the groups are `[2,1,3]`, and a group of size 3 can be formed by merging the second and third groups)
  - `nums = [2,1,3], m = 4` -> `-1` (no group of size 4 can be formed)

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to simulate the process of merging groups and checking if a group of size `m` can be formed at each time step.
- We start with the initial groups and merge them one by one, checking if a group of size `m` can be formed after each merge.
- This approach is straightforward but inefficient because it involves a lot of repeated work and does not take advantage of any structural properties of the problem.

```cpp
int findLatestGroup(vector<int>& nums, int m) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> groups = nums;
    int time = 0;
    while (true) {
        // Check if a group of size m can be formed
        bool found = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (groups[i] == m) {
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (found) {
            return time;
        }
        // If no group of size m can be formed, try to merge two groups
        bool merged = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (groups[i] + groups[j] == m) {
                    groups[i] += groups[j];
                    groups.erase(groups.begin() + j);
                    merged = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (merged) {
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!merged) {
            return -1;
        }
        time++;
    }
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$ (in the worst case, we need to try all possible merges)
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ (we need to store the current groups)
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves a lot of repeated work and does not take advantage of any structural properties of the problem, leading to high time and space complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is to use a `priority_queue` to store the groups and a `set` to store the groups that have been merged.
- We start with the initial groups and merge them one by one, using the `priority_queue` to select the two smallest groups to merge.
- We use the `set` to keep track of the groups that have been merged and to check if a group of size `m` can be formed.
- This approach is efficient because it takes advantage of the structural properties of the problem and uses data structures that allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

```cpp
int findLatestGroup(vector<int>& nums, int m) {
    int n = nums.size();
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
    for (int num : nums) {
        pq.push(num);
    }
    int time = 0;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        int size1 = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        if (pq.empty()) {
            if (size1 == m) {
                return time;
            } else {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        int size2 = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        if (size1 + size2 == m) {
            return time;
        }
        pq.push(size1 + size2);
        time++;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ (we need to insert and delete elements from the `priority_queue` $n$ times, and each operation takes $O(\log n)$ time)
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ (we need to store the `priority_queue` and the `set`)
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses the most efficient data structures and algorithms to solve the problem, and it takes advantage of the structural properties of the problem to minimize the number of operations.
