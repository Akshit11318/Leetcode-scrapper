## Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longer-contiguous-segments-of-ones-than-zeros/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A binary string `s`.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 100`.
- Expected Output: Return `true` if there is a longer contiguous segment of ones than zeros in `s`, and `false` otherwise.
- Key Requirements and Edge Cases: The string only contains `0`s and `1`s. The length of the string is between 1 and 100.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `s = "1101"` - Output: `true`
- Input: `s = "111000"` - Output: `false`
- Input: `s = "110100010"` - Output: `false`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate through all possible segments of the string and compare the lengths of contiguous ones and zeros.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize variables to store the maximum lengths of contiguous ones and zeros.
  2. Iterate through the string to find all segments of ones and zeros.
  3. For each segment, update the maximum lengths if necessary.
  4. After checking all segments, compare the maximum lengths to determine the result.

```cpp
bool checkZeroOnes(string s) {
    int maxOnes = 0, maxZeros = 0;
    int currOnes = 0, currZeros = 0;

    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '1') {
            currOnes++;
            currZeros = 0; // Reset zeros count when encountering a '1'
            maxOnes = max(maxOnes, currOnes);
        } else {
            currZeros++;
            currOnes = 0; // Reset ones count when encountering a '0'
            maxZeros = max(maxZeros, currZeros);
        }
    }
    return maxOnes > maxZeros;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the string, because we make a single pass through the string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we examine each character in the string once. The space complexity is constant because the amount of space used does not grow with the size of the input.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

The provided brute force approach is already optimal for this problem because it only requires a single pass through the string, making it $O(n)$ in time complexity, which is the best we can achieve for this problem since we must at least look at each character once.

However, we can refine the explanation for clarity and conciseness:

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is that we only need to keep track of the current and maximum lengths of contiguous ones and zeros as we iterate through the string.
- This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations (a single pass) and the space used (constant).

The code provided in the brute force section is already the optimal solution, so there's no need to repeat it here.

> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we must examine each character at least once, and we do so in a single pass, achieving the minimum possible time complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of understanding the constraints of the problem to determine the feasibility of different approaches.
- The value of keeping track of minimum and maximum values as you iterate through a sequence.
- How to analyze time and space complexity to determine the optimality of a solution.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Overcomplicating the solution by considering unnecessary steps or data structures.
- Failing to consider edge cases, such as strings of length 1 or strings consisting entirely of ones or zeros.
- Not validating the input or assuming properties of the input that are not guaranteed by the problem statement.
