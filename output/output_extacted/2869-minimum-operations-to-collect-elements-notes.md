## Minimum Operations to Collect Elements
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-collect-elements/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of integers `nums` representing the elements to collect and an integer `k` representing the number of operations allowed.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations required to collect all elements.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where `k` is greater than or equal to the number of elements, and when `k` is less than the number of elements.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2`, the minimum number of operations is 2, because we can collect elements 1 and 3 in one operation, and elements 2 and 4 in another operation.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of elements to collect in each operation.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `min_operations` to store the minimum number of operations.
  2. Generate all possible combinations of elements to collect in each operation.
  3. For each combination, calculate the number of operations required to collect all elements.
  4. Update `min_operations` if the current combination requires fewer operations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach to try all possible combinations and find the one that requires the minimum number of operations.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int min_operations = n;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        vector<int> elements;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                elements.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        if (elements.size() == k) {
            int operations = 1;
            vector<bool> collected(n, false);
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    collected[i] = true;
                }
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (!collected[i]) {
                    operations++;
                    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                        if (nums[i] == nums[j] && !collected[j]) {
                            collected[j] = true;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations);
        }
    }
    return min_operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements. This is because we generate all possible combinations of elements and for each combination, we calculate the number of operations required.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements. This is because we store the elements to collect in each operation.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity because it tries all possible combinations of elements, which results in an exponential number of operations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a `set` to store the unique elements and then calculate the minimum number of operations required to collect all elements.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a `set` to store the unique elements.
  2. Iterate over the elements and add each element to the `set`.
  3. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to collect all elements by dividing the size of the `set` by `k` and rounding up to the nearest integer.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a `set` to store the unique elements, which has an average time complexity of $O(1)$ for insertion and search operations. The minimum number of operations required to collect all elements is calculated by dividing the size of the `set` by `k` and rounding up to the nearest integer, which is the minimum number of operations required to collect all elements.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    set<int> unique_elements;
    for (int num : nums) {
        unique_elements.insert(num);
    }
    return (unique_elements.size() + k - 1) / k;
}
```
