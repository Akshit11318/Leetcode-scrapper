## Circular Permutation in Binary Representation

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-permutation-in-binary-representation/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `n` (number of bits) and `start` (starting number in binary representation)
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 16`, `0 <= start < 2^n`
- Expected Output: A list of integers representing a circular permutation of numbers in binary representation
- Key Requirements: The permutation should be circular, meaning the binary representation of the next number should differ by only one bit from the previous number
- Edge Cases: Handling cases where `n` is small or `start` is close to `2^n`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible binary numbers of length `n`, then try to form a circular permutation by checking each possible next number
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible binary numbers of length `n`
  2. For each number, find the next number that differs by only one bit
  3. Check if the next number exists and has not been visited before
  4. If a valid next number is found, add it to the permutation
  5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a circular permutation is formed or it is determined that no such permutation exists
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries to directly solve the problem by checking all possible permutations

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<int> circularPermutation(int n, int start) {
    int total = 1 << n; // Total number of possible binary numbers
    std::vector<int> permutation;
    std::vector<bool> visited(total, false);
    
    permutation.push_back(start);
    visited[start] = true;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < total - 1; ++i) {
        int next = findNext(permutation.back(), n, visited);
        if (next == -1) return {}; // No valid next number found
        permutation.push_back(next);
        visited[next] = true;
    }
    
    return permutation;
}

int findNext(int num, int n, std::vector<bool>& visited) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int next = num ^ (1 << i); // Flip the i-th bit
        if (!visited[next]) return next;
    }
    return -1; // No valid next number found
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of bits. This is because we are generating all possible binary numbers and for each number, we are trying to find the next number by flipping each bit.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, as we need to store the permutation and the visited numbers.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries to solve the problem by checking all possible permutations, which leads to exponential time and space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The problem can be solved using Gray code, which is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Generate the Gray code sequence of length `n`
  2. Find the index of the `start` number in the Gray code sequence
  3. Rotate the Gray code sequence so that the `start` number is at the beginning
- Proof of optimality: The Gray code sequence is a well-known and optimal solution for this problem, as it ensures that each successive number differs by only one bit.

```cpp
std::vector<int> circularPermutation(int n, int start) {
    std::vector<int> grayCode;
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); ++i) {
        grayCode.push_back(i ^ (i >> 1)); // Generate Gray code
    }
    
    int startIndex = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < grayCode.size(); ++i) {
        if (grayCode[i] == start) {
            startIndex = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    if (startIndex == -1) return {}; // Start number not found
    
    std::vector<int> permutation;
    for (int i = 0; i < grayCode.size(); ++i) {
        permutation.push_back(grayCode[(startIndex + i) % grayCode.size()]);
    }
    
    return permutation;
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** The Gray code sequence is an optimal solution for this problem, as it ensures that each successive number differs by only one bit. This approach has a linear time complexity in terms of the number of bits, which is the best possible complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Gray code, circular permutation
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a well-known sequence (Gray code) to solve a problem
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing time complexity by using a more efficient algorithm (Gray code)
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving binary representation and permutations

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases correctly (e.g., `n` is small or `start` is close to `2^n`)
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `n` is small or `start` is close to `2^n`
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach with exponential time complexity
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different values of `n` and `start` to ensure correctness.
