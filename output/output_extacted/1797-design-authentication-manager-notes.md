## Design Authentication Manager

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/design-authentication-manager/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The authentication manager will be initialized with a time to live (`timeToLive`) and a list of tokens. Each token will have a unique `tokenId`. 
- Expected output format: The authentication manager will provide methods to `generate` a new token, `renew` an existing token, and `countUnexpiredTokens` to count the number of unexpired tokens.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Tokens expire after `timeToLive` seconds, and the `generate`, `renew`, and `countUnexpiredTokens` methods should be implemented accordingly.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Initialize the authentication manager with a time to live of 5 seconds.
  - Generate a new token.
  - Renew the token after 3 seconds.
  - Count the number of unexpired tokens after 6 seconds.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Store all tokens in a data structure and check each token's expiration time whenever a method is called.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a data structure to store tokens.
  2. Implement the `generate` method to add a new token to the data structure with its expiration time.
  3. Implement the `renew` method to update the expiration time of an existing token.
  4. Implement the `countUnexpiredTokens` method to iterate through all tokens and count the ones that have not expired.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward solution that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
class AuthenticationManager {
public:
    int timeToLive;
    unordered_map<string, int> tokens;

    AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive) {
        this->timeToLive = timeToLive;
    }

    void generate(string tokenId, int currentTime) {
        tokens[tokenId] = currentTime + timeToLive;
    }

    void renew(string tokenId, int currentTime) {
        if (tokens.find(tokenId) != tokens.end() && tokens[tokenId] > currentTime) {
            tokens[tokenId] = currentTime + timeToLive;
        }
    }

    int countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime) {
        int count = 0;
        for (auto& token : tokens) {
            if (token.second > currentTime) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ for the `countUnexpiredTokens` method, where $n$ is the number of tokens. The `generate` and `renew` methods have a time complexity of $O(1)$ on average.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of tokens.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The `countUnexpiredTokens` method iterates through all tokens, resulting in a linear time complexity. The `generate` and `renew` methods use an unordered map to store tokens, resulting in constant time complexity for these operations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a data structure that allows for efficient removal of expired tokens, such as a queue or a priority queue.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a queue to store tokens in the order they expire.
  2. Implement the `generate` method to add a new token to the queue with its expiration time.
  3. Implement the `renew` method to update the expiration time of an existing token and reposition it in the queue.
  4. Implement the `countUnexpiredTokens` method to remove expired tokens from the queue and return the remaining size of the queue.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that expired tokens are removed efficiently, resulting in optimal time and space complexity.

```cpp
class AuthenticationManager {
public:
    int timeToLive;
    queue<pair<string, int>> tokens;

    AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive) {
        this->timeToLive = timeToLive;
    }

    void generate(string tokenId, int currentTime) {
        tokens.push({tokenId, currentTime + timeToLive});
    }

    void renew(string tokenId, int currentTime) {
        queue<pair<string, int>> newTokens;
        while (!tokens.empty()) {
            auto token = tokens.front();
            tokens.pop();
            if (token.first == tokenId) {
                newTokens.push({tokenId, currentTime + timeToLive});
            } else if (token.second > currentTime) {
                newTokens.push(token);
            }
        }
        tokens = newTokens;
    }

    int countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime) {
        while (!tokens.empty() && tokens.front().second <= currentTime) {
            tokens.pop();
        }
        return tokens.size();
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ for the `renew` method, where $n$ is the number of tokens. The `generate` and `countUnexpiredTokens` methods have a time complexity of $O(1)$ and $O(n)$, respectively.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of tokens.
> - **Optimality proof:** The use of a queue allows for efficient removal of expired tokens, resulting in optimal time and space complexity.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Use of queues and priority queues for efficient removal of expired tokens.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and using data structures to optimize the solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using queues and priority queues to reduce time complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Implementing a least recently used (LRU) cache, designing a rate limiter.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to remove expired tokens, not updating the expiration time of renewed tokens.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling empty queues, dealing with tokens that expire at the same time.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient data structures, failing to optimize the solution for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and large inputs.
