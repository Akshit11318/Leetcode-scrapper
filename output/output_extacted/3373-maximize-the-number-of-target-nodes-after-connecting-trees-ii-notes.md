## Maximize the Number of Target Nodes After Connecting Trees II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-number-of-target-nodes-after-connecting-trees-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a list of `n` trees, where each tree is represented as a list of node values.
- The goal is to connect these trees to maximize the number of target nodes, which are the nodes with values equal to the number of nodes in the connected tree.
- The input format is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a tree and contains the values of its nodes.
- The expected output is the maximum number of target nodes that can be achieved by connecting the trees.
- Key requirements include handling different tree sizes, node values, and ensuring that the connected tree is valid (i.e., it does not contain any cycles).
- Example test cases include connecting trees with different sizes and node values to demonstrate the correctness of the solution.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves trying all possible combinations of connecting the trees and counting the number of target nodes in each connected tree.
- This approach is straightforward but inefficient due to its high time complexity.
- The step-by-step breakdown involves iterating over all possible combinations of trees, connecting them, and counting the target nodes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to count target nodes in a connected tree
int countTargetNodes(vector<int>& tree) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int node : tree) {
        if (node == tree.size()) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Brute force approach to maximize target nodes
int maximizeTargetNodes(vector<vector<int>>& trees) {
    int maxTargetNodes = 0;
    // Try all possible combinations of connecting trees
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << trees.size()); mask++) {
        vector<int> connectedTree;
        for (int i = 0; i < trees.size(); i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                connectedTree.insert(connectedTree.end(), trees[i].begin(), trees[i].end());
            }
        }
        // Count target nodes in the connected tree
        int targetNodes = countTargetNodes(connectedTree);
        maxTargetNodes = max(maxTargetNodes, targetNodes);
    }
    return maxTargetNodes;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of trees and $m$ is the maximum number of nodes in a tree. This is because we try all possible combinations of connecting trees and count target nodes in each connected tree.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, as we need to store the connected tree.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves trying all possible combinations of connecting trees, which leads to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear with respect to the total number of nodes in all trees.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a bitmask to represent the connected trees and iterate over all possible combinations efficiently.
- We use a dynamic programming approach to store the maximum number of target nodes for each subset of trees.
- This approach avoids redundant calculations and reduces the time complexity significantly.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to count target nodes in a connected tree
int countTargetNodes(vector<int>& tree) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int node : tree) {
        if (node == tree.size()) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Optimal approach to maximize target nodes
int maximizeTargetNodes(vector<vector<int>>& trees) {
    int n = trees.size();
    vector<int> dp(1 << n, 0);
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        vector<int> connectedTree;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                connectedTree.insert(connectedTree.end(), trees[i].begin(), trees[i].end());
            }
        }
        // Count target nodes in the connected tree
        int targetNodes = countTargetNodes(connectedTree);
        // Update dp[mask] with the maximum number of target nodes
        for (int subMask = mask; subMask > 0; subMask = (subMask - 1) & mask) {
            dp[mask] = max(dp[mask], dp[subMask] + targetNodes);
        }
    }
    return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of trees and $m$ is the maximum number of nodes in a tree. Although the time complexity appears to be the same as the brute force approach, the optimal approach avoids redundant calculations and has a much lower constant factor.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, as we need to store the dp array.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach uses a dynamic programming approach to store the maximum number of target nodes for each subset of trees, which avoids redundant calculations and ensures that we consider all possible combinations of connecting trees.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: dynamic programming, bitmasking, and combinatorial optimization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using bitmasks to represent subsets and dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
- Optimization techniques learned: using dynamic programming to reduce time complexity and avoiding redundant calculations.
- Similar problems to practice: other combinatorial optimization problems, such as the knapsack problem or the traveling salesman problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: incorrect use of bitmasks, incorrect indexing in the dp array, and failure to handle edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: empty input, single tree, and trees with no target nodes.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach or failing to use dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
- Testing considerations: test the solution with different inputs, including edge cases, and verify that the output is correct.
