## Recyclable and Low Fat Products

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves finding products that are both recyclable and low in fat from a given list of products.
- Expected output format: The output should be a list of product ids that meet the specified conditions.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The products table contains information about each product, including `product_id`, `low_fats`, and `recyclable`. The query should return a list of `product_id`s where `low_fats` is 'Y' and `recyclable` is 'Y'.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If the products table contains rows with `product_id` = 1, `low_fats` = 'Y', `recyclable` = 'Y', and another row with `product_id` = 2, `low_fats` = 'N', `recyclable` = 'Y', the query should return only the `product_id` = 1.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating over each row in the products table and checking if the `low_fats` and `recyclable` conditions are met.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each row in the products table.
  2. For each row, check if `low_fats` is 'Y' and `recyclable` is 'Y'.
  3. If the conditions are met, add the `product_id` to the result list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, as it involves checking each row individually.

```cpp
// SQL query to find recyclable and low fat products
SELECT product_id
FROM products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the products table, because we are iterating over each row once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might need to store all `product_id`s in the result list.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are checking each row individually, and the space complexity is also linear because we are storing the result in a list.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach, as we need to check each row in the products table to determine if it meets the conditions.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use a SQL query to select the `product_id` from the products table.
  2. Apply the conditions `low_fats = 'Y'` and `recyclable = 'Y'` to filter the results.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the minimum time complexity required to check each row in the table.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we need to check each row in the table to determine if it meets the conditions, and checking each row has a time complexity of $O(n)$.

```cpp
// SQL query to find recyclable and low fat products
SELECT product_id
FROM products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, filtering, and selection.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking each row in a table to determine if it meets certain conditions.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using SQL queries to filter results.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding products that meet certain conditions, filtering data based on multiple conditions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking each row in the table, not applying the conditions correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty tables, tables with no rows that meet the conditions.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or queries that have high time complexities.
- Testing considerations: Testing the query with different inputs and edge cases to ensure it produces the correct results.
