## Find Indices With Index And Value Difference II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-indices-with-index-and-value-difference-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 100`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`, `1 <= k <= 100`.
- Expected output format: A list of indices where the absolute difference between the value and the index is less than or equal to `k`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where `k` is larger than the maximum possible difference, ensuring the solution works for arrays of varying lengths, and correctly identifying indices that meet the condition.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `[0,1,2,3,4]` because all indices have a difference between the value and the index less than or equal to `k`.
    - For `nums = [1,10,3,7,6]` and `k = 7`, the output should be `[0,1,2,3,4]` for the same reason.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through each element in the array, calculate the absolute difference between the value and its index, and check if this difference is less than or equal to `k`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store the indices that meet the condition.
    2. Iterate through the array using a loop.
    3. For each element, calculate the absolute difference between its value and its index.
    4. Check if this difference is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, add the index to the list.
    5. After iterating through all elements, return the list of indices.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by checking each element against the given condition.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

std::vector<int> findIndices(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (abs(nums[i] - i) <= k) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, because we are doing a constant amount of work for each element.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might need to store every index in the result list.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The iteration through the array and the potential storage of every index in the result list cause these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal because we must check each element at least once to determine if it meets the condition. There are no unnecessary operations or redundant checks that can be eliminated.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same as the brute force approach because it is already optimal.
- Proof of optimality: Any algorithm must at least read the input, which requires $O(n)$ time. Since our solution does this and does not perform any unnecessary work, it is optimal.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We cannot skip checking any elements without potentially missing indices that meet the condition, so further optimization in terms of time complexity is not possible.

```cpp
// Same as the brute force approach
std::vector<int> findIndices(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (abs(nums[i] - i) <= k) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, because we are doing a constant amount of work for each element.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might need to store every index in the result list.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it checks each element exactly once and does not perform any unnecessary operations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Linear scanning, conditional checks, and list construction.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The importance of checking each element at least once when determining membership in a set based on a condition.
- Optimization techniques learned: Recognizing when a brute force approach is already optimal due to the inherent requirements of the problem.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving conditional checks and list construction, such as finding elements that meet certain criteria in arrays or linked lists.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating the absolute difference or incorrectly checking the condition.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty arrays, arrays with a single element, and cases where `k` is very large or very small.
- Performance pitfalls: Assuming that a more complex solution is necessary when a simple, linear approach is sufficient.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with a variety of inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
