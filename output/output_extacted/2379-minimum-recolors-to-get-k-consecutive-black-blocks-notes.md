## Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-recolors-to-get-k-consecutive-black-blocks/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A string `blocks` consisting of 'B' (black) and 'W' (white) blocks, and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= k <= blocks.length <= 100`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of recolors required to get `k` consecutive black blocks.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where `k` is larger than the length of the string, and cases where there are already `k` or more consecutive black blocks.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7`: The answer is `3` because we can recolor the 1st, 3rd, and 6th blocks to get 7 consecutive black blocks.
  - `blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2`: The answer is `0` because there are already 2 consecutive black blocks.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of recoloring blocks to get `k` consecutive black blocks.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the minimum number of recolors.
  2. Iterate over all possible starting positions for the `k` consecutive black blocks.
  3. For each starting position, try all possible combinations of recoloring blocks to get `k` consecutive black blocks.
  4. Update the minimum number of recolors if a better solution is found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that tries all possible solutions.

```cpp
int minimumRecolors(string blocks, int k) {
    int n = blocks.size();
    int minRecolors = INT_MAX;
    
    // Iterate over all possible starting positions
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
        int recolors = 0;
        
        // Try all possible combinations of recoloring blocks
        for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
            if (blocks[j] == 'W') {
                recolors++;
            }
        }
        
        // Update the minimum number of recolors
        minRecolors = min(minRecolors, recolors);
    }
    
    return minRecolors;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the string and $k$ is the number of consecutive black blocks. This is because we iterate over all possible starting positions and try all possible combinations of recoloring blocks.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum number of recolors.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we try all possible combinations of recoloring blocks, and the space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a sliding window approach to find the minimum number of recolors.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the minimum number of recolors.
  2. Initialize a window of size `k` to the first `k` blocks.
  3. Count the number of white blocks in the window.
  4. Update the minimum number of recolors if the current window has fewer white blocks.
  5. Slide the window to the right by one block and repeat steps 3-4.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it tries all possible combinations of recoloring blocks in a single pass.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity because we must at least read the input.

```cpp
int minimumRecolors(string blocks, int k) {
    int n = blocks.size();
    int minRecolors = INT_MAX;
    int whiteBlocks = 0;
    
    // Initialize the window
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        if (blocks[i] == 'W') {
            whiteBlocks++;
        }
    }
    
    // Update the minimum number of recolors
    minRecolors = whiteBlocks;
    
    // Slide the window to the right
    for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
        if (blocks[i - k] == 'W') {
            whiteBlocks--;
        }
        if (blocks[i] == 'W') {
            whiteBlocks++;
        }
        
        // Update the minimum number of recolors
        minRecolors = min(minRecolors, whiteBlocks);
    }
    
    return minRecolors;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we only iterate over the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum number of recolors and the number of white blocks in the window.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it tries all possible combinations of recoloring blocks in a single pass.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sliding window approach, optimization techniques.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a sliding window to find the minimum number of recolors.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity by using a sliding window approach.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding the minimum number of operations to achieve a certain goal.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not updating the minimum number of recolors correctly, not handling edge cases correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `k` is larger than the length of the string, handling cases where there are already `k` or more consecutive black blocks.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a sliding window approach, not optimizing the time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different inputs, testing with edge cases.
