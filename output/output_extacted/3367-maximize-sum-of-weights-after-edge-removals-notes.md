## Maximize Sum of Weights After Edge Removals

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-sum-of-weights-after-edge-removals/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A tree with `n` nodes, each with a weight, and `n-1` edges connecting these nodes.
- Constraints: The tree is connected, and each edge has a unique weight.
- Expected Output: The maximum sum of weights of the remaining edges after removing `k` edges.
- Key Requirements:
  - The tree should remain connected after removing edges.
  - The sum of the weights of the remaining edges should be maximized.
- Edge Cases:
  - When `k` is equal to `n-1`, the tree will be reduced to a single node, and the sum of weights will be 0.
  - When `k` is 0, no edges are removed, and the sum of weights is the sum of all edge weights.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves trying all possible combinations of removing `k` edges from the tree and calculating the sum of the remaining edge weights.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of `k` edges to remove.
  2. For each combination, remove the selected edges from the tree.
  3. Check if the tree remains connected after removal.
  4. Calculate the sum of the remaining edge weights.
  5. Keep track of the maximum sum found.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxSum(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& weights, int k) {
    int n = edges.size();
    int maxSum = 0;
    
    // Generate all combinations of k edges to remove
    vector<bool> remove(n, false);
    function<void(int, int)> generateCombinations = [&](int start, int count) {
        if (count == k) {
            int sum = 0;
            bool connected = true;
            
            // Remove edges and check connectivity
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (remove[i]) {
                    // Remove edge i
                } else {
                    sum += weights[i];
                }
            }
            
            // Update maxSum if the current sum is larger
            maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
        } else {
            for (int i = start; i <= n - k + count; i++) {
                remove[i] = true;
                generateCombinations(i + 1, count + 1);
                remove[i] = false;
            }
        }
    };
    
    generateCombinations(0, 0);
    
    return maxSum;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}};
    vector<int> weights = {1, 2, 3};
    int k = 1;
    
    int result = maxSum(edges, weights, k);
    cout << "Maximum sum: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{n} \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of edges. This is because we generate all possible combinations of edges to remove, which is $2^n$, and for each combination, we calculate the sum of the remaining edge weights, which takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store the current combination of edges to remove.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations of removing edges, which leads to an exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we only need to store the current combination of edges.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a `priority_queue` to keep track of the smallest edge weights.
- We start by adding all edge weights to the `priority_queue`.
- Then, we remove the smallest `k` edge weights from the `priority_queue`.
- The sum of the remaining edge weights in the `priority_queue` is the maximum sum we can achieve.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int maxSum(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& weights, int k) {
    int n = edges.size();
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
    
    // Add all edge weights to the priority queue
    for (int weight : weights) {
        pq.push(weight);
    }
    
    // Remove the smallest k edge weights
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        pq.pop();
    }
    
    // Calculate the sum of the remaining edge weights
    int sum = 0;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        sum += pq.top();
        pq.pop();
    }
    
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}};
    vector<int> weights = {1, 2, 3};
    int k = 1;
    
    int result = maxSum(edges, weights, k);
    cout << "Maximum sum: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of edges. This is because we use a `priority_queue` to store and remove edge weights, which takes $O(\log n)$ time per operation, and we perform these operations $n$ times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store all edge weights in the `priority_queue`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a `priority_queue` to efficiently keep track of the smallest edge weights, which allows us to remove the smallest `k` edge weights in $O(n \log n)$ time. This is the best possible time complexity for this problem, as we must at least read the input, which takes $O(n)$ time.

### Final Notes

- The importance of using the right data structures, such as `priority_queue`, to solve problems efficiently.
- How to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- The concept of optimality and how to prove that an algorithm is optimal.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Using the wrong data structures, such as arrays or linked lists, to solve problems that require efficient insertion and removal of elements.
- Not considering the time and space complexity of algorithms, which can lead to inefficient solutions.
- Not proving the optimality of algorithms, which can lead to incorrect conclusions about the efficiency of solutions.
