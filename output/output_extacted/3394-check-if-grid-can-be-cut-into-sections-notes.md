## Check If Grid Can Be Cut Into Sections
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-grid-can-be-cut-into-sections/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A 2D grid `grid` of size `m x n` containing only `0` and `1`, and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: The grid can only be cut into sections if each section contains at most `k` `1`s.
- Expected Output: Return `true` if the grid can be cut into sections, otherwise return `false`.
- Key Requirements:
  - The grid can be cut into sections only if each section contains at most `k` `1`s.
  - We can only cut the grid horizontally or vertically.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]`, `k = 3`, `m = 5`, `n = 5`, Output: `false`
  - `grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`, `k = 3`, `m = 5`, `n = 5`, Output: `true`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible ways to cut the grid into sections.
- We can use a recursive approach to try all possible cuts.
- However, this approach is not efficient due to its high time complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canCut(int i, int j, int k, vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<bool>>& visited) {
        if (i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size()) return true;
        if (visited[i][j]) return true;
        visited[i][j] = true;
        int count = 0;
        for (int x = i; x < grid.size(); x++) {
            for (int y = j; y < grid[0].size(); y++) {
                if (grid[x][y] == 1) count++;
                if (count > k) return false;
            }
        }
        return canCut(i + 1, 0, k, grid, visited) || canCut(0, j + 1, k, grid, visited);
    }

    bool canCutGrid(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int k) {
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(grid.size(), vector<bool>(grid[0].size(), false));
        return canCut(0, 0, k, grid, visited);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{m+n})$ due to the recursive nature of the solution.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m+n)$ for the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The recursive approach tries all possible ways to cut the grid, resulting in an exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the number of `1`s in each section.
- We can then use a sliding window approach to try all possible sections.
- This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the grid.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canCutGrid(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> prefix(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                prefix[i][j] = prefix[i-1][j] + prefix[i][j-1] - prefix[i-1][j-1] + grid[i-1][j-1];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                for (int x = i; x < m; x++) {
                    for (int y = j; y < n; y++) {
                        int count = prefix[x+1][y+1] - prefix[x+1][j] - prefix[i][y+1] + prefix[i][j];
                        if (count > k) return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m^2 \cdot n^2)$ due to the four nested loops.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$ for the prefix sum array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the grid and uses a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the number of `1`s in each section.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: prefix sum array, sliding window approach.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the number of `1`s in each section.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a sliding window approach to try all possible sections.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not initializing the prefix sum array correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: when the grid is empty or when `k` is 0.
- Performance pitfalls: using a recursive approach with high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: testing the solution with different grid sizes and values of `k`.
