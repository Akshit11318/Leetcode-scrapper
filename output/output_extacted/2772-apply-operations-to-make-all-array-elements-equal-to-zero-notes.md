## Apply Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to Zero
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-make-all-array-elements-equal-to-zero/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer array `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations to make all elements equal to zero.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The two allowed operations are `nums[i] = nums[i] / 2` (integer division) and `nums[i] = nums[i] - 1`. We need to minimize the total number of operations.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For `nums = [2,3]`, we can make both elements zero in 3 operations (2/2, 3-1, 3-1).
    - For `nums = [10]`, the optimal sequence is 10-1, 9-1, ..., 1-1, which requires 10 operations.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible sequences of operations to find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements zero.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Generate all possible sequences of operations for each element in the array.
    2. For each sequence, apply the operations and check if all elements become zero.
    3. Keep track of the sequence with the minimum number of operations that achieves this.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to explore all possibilities, but it's inefficient due to the large number of possible sequences.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << 30); i++) { // Assuming 30 bits is enough for the sequence length
        vector<int> ops(i);
        int seq = i;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            ops[j] = seq % 2;
            seq /= 2;
        }
        vector<int> numsCopy = nums;
        int opsCount = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < numsCopy.size(); j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < ops.size(); k++) {
                if (ops[k] == 0) {
                    numsCopy[j] /= 2;
                } else {
                    numsCopy[j]--;
                }
                opsCount++;
                if (numsCopy[j] == 0) break;
            }
        }
        if (all_of(numsCopy.begin(), numsCopy.end(), [](int x){ return x == 0; })) {
            minOps = min(minOps, opsCount);
        }
    }
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{30} \cdot n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array and $m$ is the maximum number of operations in a sequence.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$ for storing the sequence of operations.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates an exponential number of sequences, and for each sequence, it applies the operations to all elements in the array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: For each number, the optimal sequence of operations is to subtract 1 until it's odd, then divide by 2 until it's no longer divisible. This is because dividing by 2 reduces the number more efficiently than subtracting 1.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. For each number in the array, calculate the number of operations required to make it zero using the optimal sequence.
    2. Sum up these operations for all numbers to get the total minimum number of operations.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses the most efficient sequence of operations for each number, and it doesn't consider unnecessary operations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int minOps = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        int ops = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2;
            } else {
                num--;
            }
            ops++;
        }
        minOps += ops;
    }
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array and $m$ is the maximum value in the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the total operations.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses the most efficient sequence of operations for each number, which is to divide by 2 when possible and subtract 1 otherwise.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy algorithms, optimal substructure.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems and solving them optimally.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using the most efficient sequence of operations for each sub-problem.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving optimal sequences of operations, such as the "Coin Change" problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases, such as zero or negative numbers in the input array.
- Edge cases to watch for: Numbers that are already zero, which require no operations.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms, such as the brute force approach, which can lead to exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the algorithm with different input arrays, including edge cases and large inputs, to ensure its correctness and efficiency.
