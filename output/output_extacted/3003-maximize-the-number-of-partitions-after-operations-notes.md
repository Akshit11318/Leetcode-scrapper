## Maximize the Number of Partitions After Operations
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-number-of-partitions-after-operations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`, find the maximum number of partitions after operations.
- Expected output format: Return the maximum number of partitions.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The string `s` contains only '0's and '1's, and `k` is a non-negative integer.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if `s = "10101"` and `k = 1`, the maximum number of partitions is 3, because we can divide the string into "10", "1", and "01".

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible partitions of the string `s` and checking if the number of '1's in each partition can be made equal to the number of '0's by using at most `k` operations.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible partitions of the string `s`.
  2. For each partition, calculate the difference between the number of '1's and '0's.
  3. If the difference can be made zero by using at most `k` operations, increment the count of valid partitions.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it is not efficient for large inputs.

```cpp
int maxPartitions(string s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    int maxPartitions = 0;
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        vector<int> partitions;
        int currentPartition = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (mask & (1 << i)) {
                currentPartition++;
            } else {
                partitions.push_back(currentPartition);
                currentPartition = 0;
            }
        }
        partitions.push_back(currentPartition);
        int validPartitions = 0;
        for (int partition : partitions) {
            int ones = 0, zeros = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < partition; i++) {
                if (s[i] == '1') {
                    ones++;
                } else {
                    zeros++;
                }
            }
            if (abs(ones - zeros) <= k) {
                validPartitions++;
            }
        }
        maxPartitions = max(maxPartitions, validPartitions);
    }
    return maxPartitions;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we generate all possible partitions of the string `s`, which takes $O(2^n)$ time, and for each partition, we calculate the difference between the number of '1's and '0's, which takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we store the partitions in a vector, which takes $O(n)$ space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity because it generates all possible partitions of the string `s`, which is an exponential number. The space complexity is linear because we store the partitions in a vector.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum number of partitions.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning of the string `s`.
  2. Calculate the difference between the number of '1's and '0's in the current window.
  3. If the difference can be made zero by using at most `k` operations, increment the count of valid partitions and move the `right` pointer to the right.
  4. If the difference cannot be made zero, move the `left` pointer to the right.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a sliding window to calculate the maximum number of partitions, which reduces the time complexity to $O(n)$.

```cpp
int maxPartitions(string s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    int maxPartitions = 0;
    int left = 0, right = 0;
    int ones = 0, zeros = 0;
    while (right < n) {
        if (s[right] == '1') {
            ones++;
        } else {
            zeros++;
        }
        while (abs(ones - zeros) > k) {
            if (s[left] == '1') {
                ones--;
            } else {
                zeros--;
            }
            left++;
        }
        maxPartitions = max(maxPartitions, right - left + 1);
        right++;
    }
    return maxPartitions;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we use a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum number of partitions.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the count of valid partitions.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a sliding window to calculate the maximum number of partitions, which reduces the time complexity to $O(n)$.
