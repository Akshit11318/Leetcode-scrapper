## Reshape Data Concatenate
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-data-concatenate/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a list of integers representing the data to be reshaped and concatenated.
- Expected output format: The output is the reshaped and concatenated data.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The reshaped and concatenated data must be in the correct order.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - Example 1: 
        - Input: `data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], row = 2, col = 3`
        - Output: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`
    - Example 2: 
        - Input: `data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], row = 3, col = 2`
        - Output: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The problem can be solved by using a brute force approach where we iterate over the input data and reshape it into the desired format.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Check if the input data can be reshaped into the desired format.
    2. Initialize an empty vector to store the reshaped data.
    3. Iterate over the input data and reshape it into the desired format.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reshape(vector<int>& data, int row, int col) {
        int n = data.size();
        if (n != row * col) {
            return data;
        }
        
        vector<vector<int>> result(row, vector<int>(col));
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                result[i][j] = data[index++];
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input data. This is because we are iterating over the input data once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input data. This is because we are storing the reshaped data in a new vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are iterating over the input data once, and the space complexity is linear because we are storing the reshaped data in a new vector.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach because the problem requires iterating over the input data to reshape it.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The approach is the same as the brute force approach.
- Proof of optimality: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach because the problem requires iterating over the input data to reshape it.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because the problem requires iterating over the input data to reshape it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reshape(vector<int>& data, int row, int col) {
        int n = data.size();
        if (n != row * col) {
            return data;
        }
        
        vector<vector<int>> result(row, vector<int>(col));
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                result[i][j] = data[index++];
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
