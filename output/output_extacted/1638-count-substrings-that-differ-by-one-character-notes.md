## Count Substrings that Differ by One Character
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-that-differ-by-one-character/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the number of substrings of `s` that differ from `t` by exactly one character.
- Expected output format: An integer representing the count of such substrings.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Substrings must differ by exactly one character, and the order of characters matters.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `s = "ab"`, `t = "bb"`, the answer is 1 because "ab" differs from "bb" by one character.
  - For `s = "ab"`, `t = "cb"`, the answer is 1 because "ab" differs from "cb" by one character.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Compare every substring of `s` with every substring of `t` to find those that differ by exactly one character.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all substrings of `s`.
  2. For each substring of `s`, compare it with every substring of `t`.
  3. Count the substrings that differ by exactly one character.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's the most straightforward method to ensure all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
int countSubstrings(string s, string t) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= s.length(); j++) {
            string subS = s.substr(i, j - i);
            for (int k = 0; k < t.length(); k++) {
                for (int l = k + 1; l <= t.length(); l++) {
                    string subT = t.substr(k, l - k);
                    if (subS.length() == subT.length()) {
                        int diff = 0;
                        for (int m = 0; m < subS.length(); m++) {
                            if (subS[m] != subT[m]) diff++;
                            if (diff > 1) break;
                        }
                        if (diff == 1) count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 * m^2 * min(n, m))$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `s` and `t` respectively. This is because we generate all substrings of `s` and `t` and compare them.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for input strings and substrings. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the count and temporary substrings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The nested loops to generate all substrings and compare them lead to high time complexity. The space complexity is low because we don't store all substrings simultaneously.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of comparing all substrings of `s` with all substrings of `t`, we can compare substrings of `s` and `t` of the same length directly, and then slide the window to compare all possible substrings.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate through all possible lengths of substrings.
  2. For each length, slide a window over `s` and `t` to compare substrings of that length.
  3. Count the substrings that differ by exactly one character.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach ensures we compare all substrings of `s` with all substrings of `t` of the same length exactly once, minimizing unnecessary comparisons.

```cpp
int countSubstrings(string s, string t) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int length = 1; length <= min(s.length(), t.length()); length++) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= t.length() - length; j++) {
                int diff = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < length; k++) {
                    if (s[i + k] != t[j + k]) diff++;
                    if (diff > 1) break;
                }
                if (diff == 1) count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sliding window technique, substring comparison.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Minimizing comparisons by considering only substrings of the same length.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing unnecessary comparisons by using a sliding window approach.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems involving substring comparisons and sliding window techniques.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly initializing or updating the count variable, or failing to break the loop when a difference greater than 1 is found.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `s` or `t` is empty, or where the lengths of `s` and `t` are very large.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms that lead to high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with various inputs, including edge cases and large inputs.
