## Minimum Number of Valid Strings to Form Target I
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-valid-strings-to-form-target-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two arrays of strings `validWords` and a target string `target`, where each string consists only of lowercase letters. The length of `target` will be in the range `[1, 100]`, and each string in `validWords` will be in the range `[1, 100]`.
- Expected output format: Find the minimum number of strings you can choose from `validWords` such that the concatenation of all the strings in the same order forms a prefix of `target`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: If it's impossible to form a prefix of `target` by concatenating any number of strings from `validWords`, return `-1`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `validWords = ["abc","ba","ac"], target = "abcbaacba"` should return `4` because we can choose `"abc"`, `"ba"`, `"ac"`, and `"ba"` in this order.
  - Example 2: `validWords = ["abcd"], target = "abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd"` should return `-1` because we cannot form a prefix of the target by concatenating any number of strings from `validWords`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of strings from `validWords` and check if their concatenation forms a prefix of `target`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of strings from `validWords`.
  2. For each combination, concatenate the strings.
  3. Check if the concatenated string is a prefix of `target`.
  4. If it is, update the minimum number of strings if necessary.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward and ensures that we consider all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int minimumNumber(vector<string>& validWords, string target) {
    int minCount = INT_MAX;
    int n = validWords.size();
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        string concat;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                concat += validWords[i];
            }
        }
        if (target.find(concat) == 0) {
            int count = __builtin_popcount(mask);
            minCount = min(minCount, count);
        }
    }
    return minCount == INT_MAX ? -1 : minCount;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the number of strings in `validWords` and $m$ is the maximum length of a string in `validWords`, because we generate all possible subsets of `validWords` and concatenate the strings in each subset.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$ because we need to store the concatenated string for each subset.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has exponential time complexity due to generating all possible subsets and linear space complexity due to storing the concatenated string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use dynamic programming to build up a solution by trying all possible strings from `validWords` at each position in `target`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `target.length() + 1` with all values set to `INT_MAX`.
  2. Set `dp[0] = 0` because we can always form an empty prefix with 0 strings.
  3. Iterate over each position `i` in `target`.
  4. For each string `word` in `validWords`, check if `word` is a prefix of the substring of `target` starting at position `i - word.length()`.
  5. If it is, update `dp[i]` with the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - word.length()] + 1`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible ways to form a prefix of `target` using the strings in `validWords` and chooses the minimum number of strings.

```cpp
int minimumNumber(vector<string>& validWords, string target) {
    int n = target.length();
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (const string& word : validWords) {
            if (i >= word.length() && target.substr(i - word.length(), word.length()) == word) {
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - word.length()] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n] == INT_MAX ? -1 : dp[n];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot k)$ where $n$ is the length of `target`, $m$ is the number of strings in `validWords`, and $k$ is the maximum length of a string in `validWords`, because we iterate over each position in `target` and each string in `validWords`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ because we need to store the dynamic programming table.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it considers all possible ways to form a prefix of `target` using the strings in `validWords` and chooses the minimum number of strings.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming and string manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using dynamic programming to avoid redundant computation.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems involving string manipulation.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the dynamic programming table correctly or not considering all possible strings from `validWords` at each position in `target`.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where it is impossible to form a prefix of `target` by concatenating any number of strings from `validWords`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that has exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
