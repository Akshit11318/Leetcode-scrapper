## Count Pairs in Two Arrays
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-in-two-arrays/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`, we need to count the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `nums1[i] + nums2[j] > x`, where `x` is a given threshold.
- Expected output format: The number of pairs satisfying the condition.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - `1 <= n <= 10^5`
  - `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^5`
  - `1 <= x <= 10^8`
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums1 = [1, 2, 3], nums2 = [4, 5, 6], x = 7`, the output should be `6` because all pairs satisfy the condition.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over each element in `nums1` and `nums2` to form pairs and check if the sum exceeds `x`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a counter `count` to store the number of pairs satisfying the condition.
  2. Iterate over each element `nums1[i]` in `nums1`.
  3. For each `nums1[i]`, iterate over each element `nums2[j]` in `nums2`.
  4. Check if `nums1[i] + nums2[j] > x`. If true, increment `count`.
  5. Return `count` as the result.

```cpp
int countPairs(int* nums1, int nums1Size, int* nums2, int nums2Size, int x) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1Size; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < nums2Size; j++) {
            if (nums1[i] + nums2[j] > x) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ because we have two nested loops, each iterating `n` times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks every possible pair, leading to quadratic time complexity. The space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that scale with input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can sort `nums2` and then for each `nums1[i]`, use binary search to find the number of elements in `nums2` that satisfy `nums1[i] + nums2[j] > x`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort `nums2` in ascending order.
  2. Initialize `count` to store the number of pairs satisfying the condition.
  3. Iterate over each `nums1[i]`.
  4. For each `nums1[i]`, perform a binary search in `nums2` to find the index `j` such that `nums2[j]` is the smallest value where `nums1[i] + nums2[j] > x`. All elements after `j` will also satisfy the condition.
  5. Increment `count` by the number of elements in `nums2` that satisfy the condition for the current `nums1[i]`.
  6. Return `count` as the result.

```cpp
int countPairs(int* nums1, int nums1Size, int* nums2, int nums2Size, int x) {
    qsort(nums2, nums2Size, sizeof(int), compare);
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1Size; i++) {
        int target = x - nums1[i];
        int left = 0, right = nums2Size - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums2[mid] <= target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        count += nums2Size - left;
    }
    return count;
}

int compare(const void * a, const void * b) {
    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + n \log n) = O(n \log n)$ because we first sort `nums2` which takes $O(n \log n)$ time, and then for each element in `nums1`, we perform a binary search in `nums2` which takes $O(\log n)$ time. Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step and the subsequent binary searches.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable and do not allocate any additional space that scales with input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we reduce the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ in the brute force approach to $O(n \log n)$ by utilizing sorting and binary search. Further optimization is not possible without changing the problem constraints or using a different algorithmic approach that does not improve the time complexity.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, binary search, and how to apply these to reduce time complexity in problems involving comparisons.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The use of sorting to enable efficient searching or comparisons, and the application of binary search to find elements in a sorted array efficiently.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing time complexity by applying sorting and using binary search instead of linear search or brute force comparisons.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving comparisons or searches in arrays, such as finding pairs or triplets that satisfy certain conditions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect implementation of sorting or binary search algorithms, not considering edge cases such as empty arrays or extreme values.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where one or both of the input arrays are empty, or where the threshold `x` is extreme (very small or very large).
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures that lead to high time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the implementation with a variety of inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness and efficiency.
