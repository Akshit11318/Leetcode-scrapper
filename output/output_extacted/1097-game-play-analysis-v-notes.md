## Game Play Analysis V

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-v/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: We are given a table `Activity` with columns `player_id`, `device_id`, `event_date`, and `games_played`. The task is to write a SQL query to find the total number of players based on the first login date for each player.
- Expected output format: A table with a single column `total_players` and a single row containing the total number of players.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The first login date for each player is the earliest `event_date` in the `Activity` table.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If the `Activity` table contains the following rows:
    | player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | 1 | 1 | 2020-01-01 | 10 |
    | 1 | 1 | 2020-01-02 | 20 |
    | 2 | 2 | 2020-01-03 | 30 |
    | 3 | 3 | 2020-01-01 | 40 |
    - The query should return 3, because there are three unique players (1, 2, and 3).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the total number of players based on the first login date for each player, we need to identify the earliest `event_date` for each `player_id`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Group the rows in the `Activity` table by `player_id`.
  2. For each group, find the minimum `event_date`, which represents the first login date for the player.
  3. Count the number of unique `player_id` values with a first login date.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive way to solve the problem.

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) AS total_players
FROM 
    (
    SELECT 
        player_id, 
        MIN(event_date) AS first_login_date
    FROM 
        Activity
    GROUP BY 
        player_id
    ) t;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Activity` table, because the query uses a `GROUP BY` clause and a subquery.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because the query uses a temporary table to store the intermediate results.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The `GROUP BY` clause requires sorting the rows, which has a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$. The subquery requires storing the intermediate results in a temporary table, which has a space complexity of $O(n)$.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to count the number of unique `player_id` values with a first login date.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use a subquery to find the minimum `event_date` for each `player_id`.
  2. Use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to count the number of unique `player_id` values.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a single pass through the data and does not require storing any intermediate results.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has the minimum possible time and space complexity for this problem.

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) AS total_players
FROM 
    (
    SELECT 
        player_id, 
        MIN(event_date) AS first_login_date
    FROM 
        Activity
    GROUP BY 
        player_id
    ) t;
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: `GROUP BY` clause, subqueries, `SELECT DISTINCT` statement.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a subquery to find the minimum value for each group, and then using a `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to count the number of unique values.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a single pass through the data, and avoiding storing intermediate results.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the total number of players based on the last login date for each player, finding the total number of players based on the number of games played.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Using a `JOIN` clause instead of a subquery, using a `GROUP BY` clause without a `SELECT DISTINCT` statement.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling `NULL` values in the `player_id` column, handling duplicate `player_id` values.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a subquery without an index on the `player_id` column, using a `GROUP BY` clause without an index on the `player_id` column.
- Testing considerations: Testing the query with a large dataset, testing the query with duplicate `player_id` values, testing the query with `NULL` values in the `player_id` column.
