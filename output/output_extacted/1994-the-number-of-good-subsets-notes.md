## The Number of Good Subsets

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-good-subsets/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 20`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`, `nums` contains at least one `1`.
- Expected Output: The number of good subsets in `nums`.
- Key Requirements and Edge Cases: A good subset is defined as a subset that does not contain both `2` and `3`, and does not contain both `6` and `9`. A subset is defined as any combination of elements from `nums`, including the empty set. However, the empty set is not considered a good subset unless `nums` contains a `1`.
- Example Test Cases:
  - Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`, Output: `6`
  - Input: `nums = [4,2,3,15]`, Output: `17`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial Thought Process: Generate all possible subsets of `nums` and check each subset to see if it is a good subset.
- Step-by-Step Breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of `nums`.
  2. For each subset, check if it contains both `2` and `3`, or both `6` and `9`.
  3. If the subset does not contain both `2` and `3`, and does not contain both `6` and `9`, and it contains at least one `1`, then it is a good subset.
- Why This Approach Comes to Mind First: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>

int numberOfGoodSubsets(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << nums.size()); mask++) {
        bool good = true;
        bool has1 = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                if (nums[i] == 1) has1 = true;
                if (nums[i] == 2 || nums[i] == 6) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                        if ((mask & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                            if (nums[j] == 3 || nums[j] == 9) {
                                good = false;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                } else if (nums[i] == 3 || nums[i] == 9) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                        if ((mask & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                            if (nums[j] == 2 || nums[j] == 6) {
                                good = false;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        if (good && has1) count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we generate all possible subsets of `nums`, and for each subset, we check all elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and the current subset.
> - **Why These Complexities Occur:** The time complexity occurs because we generate all possible subsets of `nums`, which has a time complexity of $O(2^n)$. We then check each subset, which has a time complexity of $O(n)$. The space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key Insight: We can use a bitmask to represent the presence or absence of each number in the subset. We can then use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of good subsets.
- Detailed Breakdown:
  1. Create a bitmask for each number in `nums`.
  2. Use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of good subsets for each bitmask.
  3. If a bitmask represents a good subset, add it to the count.
- Proof of Optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of good subsets, which has a time complexity of $O(2^n)$.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>

int numberOfGoodSubsets(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int count = 0;
    std::bitset<31> mask;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 1) {
            count++;
        } else if (num == 2 || num == 3 || num == 6 || num == 9) {
            if (mask[num] == 0) {
                mask[num] = 1;
                count += numberOfGoodSubsetsHelper(mask, nums);
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int numberOfGoodSubsetsHelper(std::bitset<31>& mask, std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 1) {
            count++;
        } else if (num == 2 || num == 3 || num == 6 || num == 9) {
            if (mask[num] == 0) {
                mask[num] = 1;
                count += numberOfGoodSubsetsHelper(mask, nums);
                mask[num] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

However, a more optimal solution exists using the concept of `mask` and `dp` where `dp[mask]` represents the number of subsets that can be formed with the numbers that have been used in the `mask`.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>

int numberOfGoodSubsets(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<int> primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29};
    std::vector<int> count(31, 0);
    for (int num : nums) {
        count[num]++;
    }
    std::vector<int> dp(1 << 10, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
        for (int mask = (1 << 10) - 1; mask >= 0; mask--) {
            for (int j = 0; j < primes.size(); j++) {
                if (i == primes[j] && (mask & (1 << j)) == 0 && count[i] > 0) {
                    dp[mask | (1 << j)] += dp[mask] * count[i];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    int res = dp[(1 << 10) - 1];
    for (int i = 2; i <= 30; i++) {
        if (count[i] > 0) {
            res *= (1 + count[i]);
        }
    }
    return res - (count[1] == 0);
}
```
