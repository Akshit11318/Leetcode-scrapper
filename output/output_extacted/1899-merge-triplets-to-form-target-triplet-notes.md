## Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-triplets-to-form-target-triplet/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given `triplets` which is a list of integer arrays, and a `target` which is also an integer array. Each `triplet` is of the form `[a, b, c]`, and the `target` is of the form `[x, y, z]`.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if there exists a way to merge the `triplets` to form the `target`, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - The `triplets` list can be empty.
    - The `target` array must be formed by taking one element from each `triplet`, and the elements must be taken in the same order as they appear in the `triplets`.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - `triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]]`, `target = [2,7,5]`: Return `true` because we can take the first element from the first `triplet`, the second element from the third `triplet`, and the third element from the second `triplet`.
    - `triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]]`, `target = [3,4,5]`: Return `true` because we can take the first `triplet` as it is.
    - `triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]]`, `target = [5,5,5]`: Return `false` because we cannot form the `target` array by taking one element from each `triplet`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves checking all possible combinations of elements from the `triplets` to form the `target` array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Initialize an empty array to store the current combination of elements.
    2. Iterate over each `triplet` in the `triplets` list.
    3. For each `triplet`, iterate over each element in the `triplet`.
    4. Add the current element to the current combination.
    5. Check if the current combination is equal to the `target` array.
    6. If it is, return `true`.
    7. If not, remove the last added element from the current combination.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it is not efficient because it has a high time complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool mergeTriplets(vector<vector<int>>& triplets, vector<int>& target) {
    int n = triplets.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
        vector<int> current;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i & (1 << j)) {
                current.push_back(triplets[j][0]);
                current.push_back(triplets[j][1]);
                current.push_back(triplets[j][2]);
            }
        }
        if (current.size() == target.size()) {
            bool match = true;
            for (int k = 0; k < target.size(); k++) {
                if (current[k] != target[k]) {
                    match = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (match) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n * n * m)$, where $n$ is the number of `triplets` and $m$ is the number of elements in each `triplet`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n * m)$, where $n$ is the number of `triplets` and $m$ is the number of elements in each `triplet`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are generating all possible combinations of elements from the `triplets`. The space complexity is also high because we are storing the current combination of elements.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can solve this problem by checking if there exists a `triplet` that has the same first element as the `target` array, a `triplet` that has the same second element as the `target` array, and a `triplet` that has the same third element as the `target` array.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Initialize three variables to store the indices of the `triplets` that have the same first, second, and third elements as the `target` array.
    2. Iterate over each `triplet` in the `triplets` list.
    3. For each `triplet`, check if the first element is less than or equal to the first element of the `target` array, the second element is less than or equal to the second element of the `target` array, and the third element is less than or equal to the third element of the `target` array.
    4. If the `triplet` satisfies the conditions, update the indices of the `triplets` that have the same first, second, and third elements as the `target` array.
    5. After iterating over all `triplets`, check if we have found `triplets` that have the same first, second, and third elements as the `target` array.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a low time complexity and it is guaranteed to find the correct solution if it exists.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool mergeTriplets(vector<vector<int>>& triplets, vector<int>& target) {
    int x = -1, y = -1, z = -1;
    for (auto& t : triplets) {
        if (t[0] <= target[0] && t[1] <= target[1] && t[2] <= target[2]) {
            if (t[0] == target[0]) x = t[0];
            if (t[1] == target[1]) y = t[1];
            if (t[2] == target[2]) z = t[2];
        }
    }
    return x != -1 && y != -1 && z != -1;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of `triplets`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the indices of the `triplets`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has a low time complexity and it is guaranteed to find the correct solution if it exists.
