## Maximum Star Sum of a Graph

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-star-sum-of-a-graph/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem is given a graph with `n` nodes and `edges` list where each edge is represented as a pair of integers `[u, v, w]`, and an integer `k`. The task is to find the maximum star sum of the graph.
- Expected output format: The maximum star sum.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where the graph is empty or has no edges, and the weight of the edges can be negative.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1:
    - Input: `n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[0,2,4]], k = 2`
    - Output: `7`
    - Explanation: The maximum star sum is obtained by selecting the edges `(0,1,2)` and `(1,2,3)`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of `k` edges to find the maximum star sum.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of `k` edges.
  2. For each combination, calculate the star sum by summing the weights of the edges.
  3. Keep track of the maximum star sum found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach to try all possible combinations and find the maximum star sum.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxStarSum(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int k) {
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;
    // Generate all possible combinations of k edges
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << edges.size()); mask++) {
        if (__builtin_popcount(mask) != k) continue;
        int sum = 0;
        // Calculate the star sum for the current combination
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); i++) {
            if ((mask >> i) & 1) {
                sum += edges[i][2];
            }
        }
        maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^m \cdot k)$, where $m$ is the number of edges. This is because we generate all possible combinations of `k` edges and calculate the star sum for each combination.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum star sum and the current combination.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is exponential because we try all possible combinations of `k` edges. The space complexity is constant because we only use a small amount of space to store the maximum star sum and the current combination.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a greedy approach to select the `k` edges with the maximum weights.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the edges in descending order of their weights.
  2. Select the first `k` edges with the maximum weights.
  3. Calculate the star sum by summing the weights of the selected edges.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we select the `k` edges with the maximum weights, which maximizes the star sum.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because we select the `k` edges with the maximum weights.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxStarSum(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int k) {
    sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        return a[2] > b[2];
    });
    int maxSum = 0;
    // Select the first k edges with the maximum weights
    for (int i = 0; i < min(k, (int)edges.size()); i++) {
        maxSum += edges[i][2];
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \log m)$, where $m$ is the number of edges. This is because we sort the edges in descending order of their weights.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum star sum.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we select the `k` edges with the maximum weights, which maximizes the star sum.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy approach, sorting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Selecting the maximum or minimum elements.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a greedy approach to select the optimal elements.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems that involve selecting the maximum or minimum elements, such as finding the maximum subarray sum.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking the boundary conditions, not handling the case where the graph is empty or has no edges.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where the weight of the edges can be negative.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an exponential-time algorithm when a polynomial-time algorithm is possible.
- Testing considerations: Testing the algorithm with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
