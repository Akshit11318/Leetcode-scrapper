## Change Data Type

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/change-data-type/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given a table `numbers` with a column `id` of type `int` and a column `num` of type `varchar(255)`.
- Constraints: `id` is the primary key.
- Expected output format: Change the type of the `num` column to `int`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The `num` column contains strings that can be converted to integers. If a string cannot be converted to an integer, it should be converted to `NULL`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `numbers` table contains rows with `num` column values that can be converted to integers.
  - `numbers` table contains rows with `num` column values that cannot be converted to integers.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over each row in the `numbers` table and attempt to convert the `num` column value to an integer. If successful, update the `num` column value; otherwise, set it to `NULL`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a cursor to iterate over each row in the `numbers` table.
  2. For each row, attempt to convert the `num` column value to an integer using a try-catch block.
  3. If the conversion is successful, update the `num` column value; otherwise, set it to `NULL`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it may not be efficient for large tables.

```cpp
// This problem is an SQL problem and does not require a C++ solution.
// However, we can use a SQL query to solve the problem.
SELECT 
  id,
  CAST(num AS SIGNED) AS num
FROM 
  numbers;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `numbers` table.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are iterating over each row in the table once. The space complexity is constant because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the `CAST` function in SQL to convert the `num` column values to integers. If a string cannot be converted to an integer, it will be converted to `NULL`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use the `CAST` function to convert the `num` column values to integers.
  2. If a string cannot be converted to an integer, it will be converted to `NULL`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a single SQL query to convert all the `num` column values to integers.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it uses a single SQL query to convert all the `num` column values to integers.

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  CAST(num AS SIGNED) AS num
FROM 
  numbers;
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: SQL queries, data type conversion.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using the `CAST` function to convert data types in SQL.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a single SQL query to convert all the `num` column values to integers.
- Similar problems to practice: Other SQL problems that involve data type conversion.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not using the `CAST` function correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Strings that cannot be converted to integers.
- Performance pitfalls: Using multiple SQL queries to convert the `num` column values to integers.
- Testing considerations: Testing the query with different types of input data.
