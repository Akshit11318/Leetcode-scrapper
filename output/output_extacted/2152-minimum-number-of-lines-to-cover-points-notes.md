## Minimum Number of Lines to Cover Points
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-lines-to-cover-points/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]`, and you need to find the minimum number of lines that cover all the points.
- Constraints: `1 <= points.length <= 10^5`, and `points[i].length == 2`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of lines required to cover all points.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Points may have the same x-coordinate, and lines can cover multiple points.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]`, output: `1` because all points lie on the line `y = x`.
  - Example 2: `points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,4]]`, output: `2` because two lines are needed to cover all points.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of points to form lines and check if all points are covered.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible pairs of points.
  2. For each pair, calculate the slope of the line passing through them.
  3. Check if all points lie on the line.
  4. If not, try another pair of points.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to ensure all points are covered, but it's inefficient due to its high time complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int minLines(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    int minLines = n; // Initialize with the maximum possible lines

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            int sameLine = 2; // Count of points on the current line
            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                if (k == i || k == j) continue; // Skip the points used to form the line
                int x1 = points[i][0], y1 = points[i][1];
                int x2 = points[j][0], y2 = points[j][1];
                int x3 = points[k][0], y3 = points[k][1];
                // Check if point k lies on the line formed by points i and j
                if ((y2 - y1) * (x3 - x1) == (y3 - y1) * (x2 - x1)) {
                    sameLine++;
                }
            }
            // Update minLines if all points are covered by fewer lines
            if (sameLine == n) {
                minLines = 1;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return minLines;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of points. This is because we have three nested loops.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum lines and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inefficient due to the nested loops that check all possible combinations of points.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a hashmap to store the frequency of each slope.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate over each point.
  2. For each point, iterate over all other points.
  3. Calculate the slope of the line passing through the two points.
  4. Store the frequency of each slope in a hashmap.
  5. Find the maximum frequency, which represents the maximum number of points that can be covered by a single line.
  6. The minimum number of lines required is the total number of points divided by the maximum frequency.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible lines that can be formed by the points and finds the maximum number of points that can be covered by a single line.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int minLines(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    int minLines = n; // Initialize with the maximum possible lines

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        unordered_map<double, int> slopeCount;
        int samePoint = 1; // Count of points with the same coordinates
        int maxPointsOnLine = 0; // Maximum points on a line passing through point i
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i == j) continue; // Skip the same point
            int x1 = points[i][0], y1 = points[i][1];
            int x2 = points[j][0], y2 = points[j][1];
            if (x1 == x2 && y1 == y2) {
                samePoint++;
            } else {
                double slope = (y2 - y1) * 1.0 / (x2 - x1);
                slopeCount[slope]++;
                maxPointsOnLine = max(maxPointsOnLine, slopeCount[slope]);
            }
        }
        maxPointsOnLine += samePoint; // Add points with the same coordinates
        minLines = min(minLines, (n + maxPointsOnLine - 1) / maxPointsOnLine); // Update minLines
    }
    return minLines;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Using a hashmap to store the frequency of each slope, and finding the maximum frequency to determine the minimum number of lines.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Divide and conquer, and using a hashmap to store frequency.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$ by using a hashmap.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems that involve finding the minimum number of lines or planes to cover a set of points in a higher-dimensional space.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling the case where two points have the same coordinates, and not updating the minimum number of lines correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: When all points have the same coordinates, and when there are only two points.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach with a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it produces the correct output.
