## Maximize Greatness of an Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-greatness-of-an-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums` of size `n` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.
- Expected Output: The maximum possible sum of the greatness of `nums` after `k` replacements.
- Key Requirements:
  - Replace `k` elements in `nums` with any positive integer to maximize the greatness of `nums`, where the greatness of `nums` is the number of elements that are greater than their previous element.
  - The replaced elements must be greater than the previous element to increase the greatness.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `k = 1`, the maximum greatness is `4`.
  - `nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, `k = 1`, the maximum greatness is `0`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves trying all possible replacements for the `k` elements.
- For each replacement, we calculate the greatness of the array.
- We keep track of the maximum greatness found so far.
- This approach comes to mind first because it guarantees finding the optimal solution by exploring all possible solutions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeGreatness(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int maxGreatness = 0;
        
        // Generate all possible replacements
        vector<int> replacements;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            replacements.push_back(i);
        }
        
        // Try all possible combinations of replacements
        vector<int> currentReplacements(k);
        function<void(int)> tryReplacements = [&](int index) {
            if (index == k) {
                // Calculate the greatness of the current replacement
                vector<int> currentNums = nums;
                for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                    currentNums[i] = replacements[currentReplacements[i]];
                }
                int greatness = 0;
                for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                    if (currentNums[i] > currentNums[i - 1]) {
                        greatness++;
                    }
                }
                maxGreatness = max(maxGreatness, greatness);
            } else {
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    currentReplacements[index] = i;
                    tryReplacements(index + 1);
                }
            }
        };
        tryReplacements(0);
        
        return maxGreatness;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^{k+1})$ because we try all possible combinations of replacements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$ for the recursion stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible solutions, resulting in exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is that we only need to replace the first `k` elements to maximize the greatness.
- We can sort the array and then replace the first `k` elements with the largest `k` elements.
- This approach is optimal because it guarantees finding the maximum possible greatness.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeGreatness(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        // Replace the first k elements with the largest k elements
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            nums[i] = nums[n - k + i];
        }
        
        // Calculate the greatness of the modified array
        int greatness = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                greatness++;
            }
        }
        
        return greatness;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ because we sort the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we modify the array in place.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it replaces the smallest elements with the largest elements, maximizing the greatness.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of sorting in solving array problems.
- The concept of replacing elements to maximize a certain property (in this case, greatness).
- The trade-off between brute force and optimal approaches.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the sorting approach, which can significantly reduce the time complexity.
- Not realizing that replacing the first `k` elements is sufficient to maximize the greatness.
- Not handling edge cases, such as when `k` is equal to `n`.
