## Sum of Digits in Base K
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-in-base-k/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a non-negative integer `n` and an integer `k`, find the sum of the digits of `n` in base `k`.
- Input format and constraints: `n` is a non-negative integer, and `k` is an integer where `1 <= k <= 10`.
- Expected output format: The sum of the digits of `n` in base `k`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where `n` is 0, `k` is 1, and `n` is a large number.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `n = 34, k = 6` -> Output: `9` (Explanation: `34` in base `6` is `122`. The sum of its digits is `1 + 2 + 2 = 5`, but since `k` is `6`, we convert `34` to base `6` which is `54`. The sum of its digits is `5 + 4 = 9`).
- `n = 10, k = 10` -> Output: `1` (Explanation: `10` in base `10` is `10`. The sum of its digits is `1 + 0 = 1`).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Convert the number `n` to base `k` and then calculate the sum of its digits.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Convert `n` to base `k`.
  2. Calculate the sum of the digits of the base `k` representation.

```cpp
int sumBase(int n, int k) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    int sum = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        sum += n % k;
        n /= k;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(log_k(n))$ (where `log_k(n)` is the number of digits in the base `k` representation of `n`).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ (constant space used).
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The while loop runs until `n` becomes 0, and in each iteration, `n` is divided by `k`. This is equivalent to the number of digits in the base `k` representation of `n`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same as the brute force approach. The optimal solution is already achieved in the brute force approach.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: Same as the brute force approach.
- Proof of optimality: The time complexity of $O(log_k(n))$ is optimal because we need to convert the number to base `k` and calculate the sum of its digits.

```cpp
int sumBase(int n, int k) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    int sum = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        sum += n % k;
        n /= k;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Base conversion, digit sum calculation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Conversion to a different base and calculating the sum of digits.
- Optimization techniques learned: None (the brute force approach is already optimal).
- Similar problems to practice: Base conversion, digit sum calculation.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling the case where `n` is 0.
- Edge cases to watch for: `k` is 1, `n` is a large number.
- Performance pitfalls: None (the optimal solution has a time complexity of $O(log_k(n))$).
- Testing considerations: Test with different values of `n` and `k`, including edge cases.
