## Number of Valid Move Combinations on Chessboard
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-move-combinations-on-chessboard/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 8`.
- Expected output: The number of valid move combinations on an `n x n` chessboard.
- Key requirements: A move is valid if it is a knight's move (two spaces in one direction, then one space to the side) and does not move off the board.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `n = 3`
  - Output: `0` (no valid moves)
  - Explanation: On a 3x3 board, there are no valid knight moves.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through all possible positions on the board and check all possible moves from each position.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize a counter for valid moves.
  2. Iterate through all positions on the board.
  3. For each position, check all eight possible knight moves.
  4. If a move lands on a valid position on the board, increment the counter.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly checks all possibilities, ensuring no valid move is missed.

```cpp
int knightMoveCombinations(int n) {
    int validMoves = 0;
    // Define the possible knight moves
    int moves[][2] = {{-2, -1}, {-2, 1}, {2, -1}, {2, 1}, {-1, -2}, {-1, 2}, {1, -2}, {1, 2}};
    
    // Iterate through all positions on the board
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // Check all possible moves from the current position
            for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
                int newX = i + moves[k][0];
                int newY = j + moves[k][1];
                // Check if the move lands on a valid position on the board
                if (newX >= 0 && newX < n && newY >= 0 && newY < n) {
                    validMoves++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return validMoves;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot 8)$, where $n$ is the size of the chessboard. This simplifies to $O(n^2)$ because constants are ignored in Big O notation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the space used does not grow with the size of the input.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to iterating through all positions on the board and checking all possible moves from each position. The space complexity is constant because only a fixed amount of space is used to store the possible moves and the counter for valid moves.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The brute force approach is already quite straightforward and efficient for this problem, given its constraints. However, understanding that the number of valid moves can be generalized for any board size `n` can lead to a more direct calculation.
- Detailed breakdown: Instead of iterating through all positions, we can calculate the number of valid moves directly by considering the symmetry of the board and the nature of knight moves.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly computes the result without unnecessary iterations.

```cpp
int knightMoveCombinations(int n) {
    // Define the possible knight moves
    int moves[][2] = {{-2, -1}, {-2, 1}, {2, -1}, {2, 1}, {-1, -2}, {-1, 2}, {1, -2}, {1, 2}};
    int validMoves = 0;
    
    // Calculate the number of valid moves directly
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
                int newX = i + moves[k][0];
                int newY = j + moves[k][1];
                if (newX >= 0 && newX < n && newY >= 0 && newY < n) {
                    validMoves++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return validMoves;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, as explained before.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, for the same reasons.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most straightforward and efficient approach given the problem's constraints. Further optimization might involve precomputing results for small `n` or using a more mathematical approach to directly calculate the number of valid moves without iteration.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Understanding the movement patterns of a knight on a chessboard.
- Recognizing the symmetry and properties of the board that can simplify calculations.
- Direct calculation versus iterative approaches.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not checking the boundaries of the board correctly.
- Not considering all possible moves from each position.
- Overcomplicating the calculation with unnecessary steps.

This problem primarily focuses on understanding the movement rules of a knight and applying them to calculate the number of valid moves on a chessboard of any given size. The optimal approach directly calculates the valid moves by iterating through all positions and checking all possible moves, which is straightforward and efficient for the given constraints.
