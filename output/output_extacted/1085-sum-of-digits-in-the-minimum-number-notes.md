## Sum of Digits in the Minimum Number
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-in-the-minimum-number/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given an array of strings `nums`, where each string consists of digits.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 100`, `1 <= nums[i].length <= 100`, `nums[i]` consists of digits.
- Expected output format: Return the sum of digits of the smallest number in `nums`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The smallest number is determined lexicographically.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `nums = ["111","222","333","444"]`, Output: `9` (Explanation: The smallest number is "111", and its sum of digits is 1+1+1 = 3. However, this example doesn't match the expected output. Let's consider another example: Input: `nums = ["69","88","1","23","7"]`, Output: `1` (Explanation: The smallest number is "1", and its sum of digits is 1).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Sort the array of strings lexicographically and then find the sum of digits of the first string.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Sort the array `nums`.
  2. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
  3. For each character in the first string of the sorted array, add the digit value to `sum`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward and easy to implement.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int sumOfDigitsInMinNumber(std::vector<std::string>& nums) {
    // Sort the array of strings
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    // Initialize sum to 0
    int sum = 0;
    
    // Calculate the sum of digits of the first string
    for (char c : nums[0]) {
        sum += c - '0';
    }
    
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings and $m$ is the maximum length of a string. This is because we sort the array of strings, which takes $O(n \log n)$ time, and then iterate over the characters of the first string, which takes $O(m)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, assuming the sorting algorithm used by `std::sort` has a constant space complexity.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The sorting operation dominates the time complexity, while the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the sum and other variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same as the brute force approach, because sorting the array is the most efficient way to find the smallest string lexicographically.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the array `nums`.
  2. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
  3. For each character in the first string of the sorted array, add the digit value to `sum`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has the same time complexity as the brute force approach, and we cannot do better than sorting the array to find the smallest string.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Any other approach would require comparing strings, which would also involve sorting or iterating over the strings, resulting in the same or worse time complexity.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int sumOfDigitsInMinNumber(std::vector<std::string>& nums) {
    // Sort the array of strings
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    // Initialize sum to 0
    int sum = 0;
    
    // Calculate the sum of digits of the first string
    for (char c : nums[0]) {
        sum += c - '0';
    }
    
    return sum;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, iteration, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Finding the smallest or largest element in an array, and then performing operations on it.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the optimal approach is the same as the brute force approach.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the maximum or minimum value in an array, and then performing operations on it.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty array or a string with non-digit characters.
- Edge cases to watch for: An empty array, a string with non-digit characters, or a string with a very large number of digits.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a sorting algorithm with a high time complexity, such as bubble sort or insertion sort.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it works correctly.
