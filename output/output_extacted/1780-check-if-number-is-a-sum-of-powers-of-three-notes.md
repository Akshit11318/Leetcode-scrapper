## Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-number-is-a-sum-of-powers-of-three/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an integer `n`.
- Expected output format: The output should be a boolean indicating whether `n` can be expressed as the sum of powers of three.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: `n` is a non-negative integer.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - Input: `n = 12` 
    - Output: `true` 
    - Explanation: `12 = 3^2 + 3^1`
  - Input: `n = 13`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: `13 = 3^2 + 3^0`
  - Input: `n = 14`
    - Output: `false`
    - Explanation: `14` cannot be expressed as the sum of powers of three.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of powers of three to see if their sum equals `n`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all powers of three up to `n`.
  2. Use a recursive or iterative approach to try all combinations of these powers of three.
  3. Check if the sum of any combination equals `n`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward and ensures that all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        vector<int> powers;
        for (int i = 0; i <= log(n) / log(3); i++) {
            powers.push_back(pow(3, i));
        }
        
        vector<bool> dp(n + 1, false);
        dp[0] = true;
        
        for (int power : powers) {
            for (int i = power; i <= n; i++) {
                if (dp[i - power]) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \log(n))$ where $n$ is the input number. This is because for each power of three, we potentially update the dynamic programming array up to `n` times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + \log(n))$ for storing the powers of three and the dynamic programming array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach requires checking all combinations of powers of three, leading to exponential time complexity in the worst case. However, the dynamic programming approach reduces this to a more manageable time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Notice that in base 3, each digit can be 0, 1, or 2. However, to represent a number as a sum of powers of three, each digit in its base 3 representation must be either 0 or 1.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Convert `n` to base 3.
  2. Check if all digits in the base 3 representation are either 0 or 1.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly checks the condition under which a number can be represented as a sum of powers of three, without needing to try all combinations.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a linear time complexity with respect to the number of digits in `n`'s base 3 representation, which is the minimum required to examine each digit.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        while (n) {
            if (n % 3 == 2) return false;
            n /= 3;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log(n))$ because we divide `n` by 3 in each iteration, effectively reducing the problem size by a constant factor in each step.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we only need to examine each digit of `n` in base 3 once to determine if it can be represented as a sum of powers of three.
