## Find a Good Subset of the Matrix
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-good-subset-of-the-matrix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes a `matrix` as input, where each row represents a subset of integers. The task is to find a subset of the rows such that the subset contains all integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the number of columns in the matrix.
- Expected output format: The output should be a boolean indicating whether such a subset exists.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The subset should contain all integers from 1 to `n`, and the rows in the subset should not contain any duplicate integers.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 4], [2, 1, 3]]`, `n = 3`. The output should be `true` because the subset `[[1, 2, 3], [3, 4]]` contains all integers from 1 to 3.
  - Example 2: `matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`, `n = 3`. The output should be `false` because the subset `[[1, 2, 3]]` contains all integers from 1 to 3, but there is no subset that contains all integers from 1 to 6.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible subsets of the rows and check if they contain all integers from 1 to `n`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of the rows.
  2. For each subset, check if it contains all integers from 1 to `n`.
  3. If a subset contains all integers from 1 to `n`, return `true`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible solutions.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>

bool findGoodSubset(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix, int n) {
    int num_rows = matrix.size();
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << num_rows); mask++) {
        std::bitset<32> subset;
        for (int i = 0; i < num_rows; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                for (int num : matrix[i]) {
                    subset.set(num - 1);
                }
            }
        }
        if (subset.count() == n) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of rows and $m$ is the maximum number of elements in a row. This is because we generate all possible subsets of the rows and check each subset.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the subset.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we try all possible subsets of the rows, and the space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a bitmask to represent the subset of rows, and use a bitset to keep track of the integers that are covered by the subset.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a bitmask with all bits set to 0.
  2. Iterate over all possible subsets of the rows.
  3. For each subset, use a bitset to keep track of the integers that are covered by the subset.
  4. If the subset covers all integers from 1 to `n`, return `true`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it tries all possible subsets of the rows, and uses a bitset to efficiently keep track of the integers that are covered by the subset.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>

bool findGoodSubset(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix, int n) {
    int num_rows = matrix.size();
    std::bitset<32> all_integers;
    all_integers.set();
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << num_rows); mask++) {
        std::bitset<32> subset;
        for (int i = 0; i < num_rows; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                for (int num : matrix[i]) {
                    subset.set(num - 1);
                }
            }
        }
        if ((subset & all_integers).count() == n) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: bitmask, bitset, subset generation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: trying all possible solutions, using a bitmask to represent a subset.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a bitset to efficiently keep track of the integers that are covered by the subset.
- Similar problems to practice: subset sum, subset product, etc.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking for edge cases, not initializing variables correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: empty input, duplicate integers in the rows.
- Performance pitfalls: using a naive approach that tries all possible subsets of the rows without using a bitmask or bitset.
- Testing considerations: test the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
