## Minimum Lines to Represent a Line Chart
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-lines-to-represent-a-line-chart/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A list of `points` where each point is a pair of `(x, y)` coordinates.
- Constraints: `1 <= points.length <= 100`, `points[i].length == 2`, `1 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^9`.
- Expected Output: The minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart.
- Key Requirements: 
  - Each line must pass through at least two points.
  - The line chart is represented by the minimum number of lines that pass through all the given points.
- Edge Cases:
  - All points may lie on the same line.
  - No two points have the same x-coordinate.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible pair of points and determining if a line can be drawn through them.
- For each point, calculate the slope with every other point and store these slopes in a data structure.
- Count the number of unique slopes for each point. The minimum count across all points indicates the minimum number of lines needed, as this represents the point that can be connected to the most other points with the fewest lines.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int minimumLines(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    if (n <= 2) return 1;
    
    std::unordered_map<double, int> slopes;
    int minLines = n;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int samePoint = 1; // Count of points with the same coordinates
        int verticalLines = 0; // Count of vertical lines
        slopes.clear();
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i == j) continue;
            if (points[i] == points[j]) {
                samePoint++;
                continue;
            }
            
            if (points[i][0] == points[j][0]) {
                verticalLines++;
                continue;
            }
            
            double slope = (double)(points[j][1] - points[i][1]) / (points[j][0] - points[i][0]);
            slopes[slope]++;
        }
        
        int linesThroughI = (slopes.size() + (verticalLines > 0 ? 1 : 0));
        minLines = std::min(minLines, linesThroughI);
    }
    
    return minLines;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of points. This is because for each point, we potentially check every other point.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the slopes and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops over the points, leading to quadratic time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the storage needed for slopes and other variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to recognize that the minimum number of lines can be found by considering the point that can be connected to the most other points with the fewest lines.
- This involves calculating the slope of the line passing through each pair of points and counting the number of unique slopes.
- However, the optimal approach simplifies the calculation by observing the pattern in how slopes are calculated and stored, avoiding unnecessary computations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int minimumLines(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    if (n <= 2) return 1;
    
    int minLines = n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::unordered_map<double, int> slopes;
        int samePoint = 1;
        int verticalLines = 0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i == j) continue;
            if (points[i] == points[j]) {
                samePoint++;
                continue;
            }
            
            if (points[i][0] == points[j][0]) {
                verticalLines++;
                continue;
            }
            
            double slope = (double)(points[j][1] - points[i][1]) / (points[j][0] - points[i][0]);
            slopes[slope]++;
        }
        
        int linesThroughI = (slopes.size() + (verticalLines > 0 ? 1 : 0));
        minLines = std::min(minLines, linesThroughI);
    }
    
    return minLines;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, as we still need to compare each point with every other point to find the minimum number of lines.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the slopes and handling vertical lines.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it must consider all points and their possible connections to ensure the minimum number of lines is found. Any less, and it might miss a configuration that requires fewer lines.
