## Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-garden-perimeter-to-collect-enough-apples/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given an integer `n` and an integer array `apples` where `apples[i]` represents the number of apples in the `i-th` tree.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= apples.length <= 100`, `1 <= apples[i] <= 100`.
- Expected output format: Return the minimum perimeter of the garden to collect enough apples.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The garden is a rectangle with integer side lengths.
  - You must collect all apples in the garden.
  - The perimeter is calculated as `2 * (length + width)`.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - For `n = 3`, `apples = [6, 8, 3]`, the minimum perimeter is `8` (a rectangle with length `2` and width `2`).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate all possible perimeters of rectangles that can fit all the trees and collect all the apples.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Sort the `apples` array in descending order.
  2. Initialize `perimeter` to a large value.
  3. Iterate over all possible lengths and widths of the rectangle.
  4. Check if the current rectangle can fit all the trees and collect all the apples.
  5. Update `perimeter` if the current rectangle's perimeter is smaller.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach to try all possible solutions.

```cpp
int minimumPerimeter(int n, vector<int>& apples) {
    int totalApples = accumulate(apples.begin(), apples.end(), 0);
    int perimeter = INT_MAX;
    for (int length = 1; length <= n; length++) {
        for (int width = 1; width <= n; width++) {
            int currentPerimeter = 2 * (length + width);
            int currentApples = length * width;
            if (currentApples >= totalApples) {
                perimeter = min(perimeter, currentPerimeter);
            }
        }
    }
    return perimeter;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the input integer.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** We iterate over all possible lengths and widths of the rectangle, resulting in a quadratic time complexity. The space complexity is constant because we only use a few variables to store the perimeter and the total number of apples.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The minimum perimeter occurs when the rectangle is as close to a square as possible.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Calculate the total number of apples.
  2. Find the smallest square that can fit all the apples.
  3. Calculate the perimeter of the square.
- Proof of optimality: A square has the smallest perimeter among all rectangles with a given area.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The square is the most efficient shape to enclose a given area.

```cpp
int minimumPerimeter(int n, vector<int>& apples) {
    int totalApples = accumulate(apples.begin(), apples.end(), 0);
    int side = ceil(sqrt(totalApples));
    return 2 * (side + side);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the `apples` array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The square has the smallest perimeter among all rectangles with a given area, so this solution is optimal.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The importance of understanding the problem and finding the most efficient solution.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty `apples` array.
- Edge cases to watch for: The input integer `n` being 1, or the `apples` array being empty.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach when a more efficient solution is possible.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different inputs, including edge cases.
