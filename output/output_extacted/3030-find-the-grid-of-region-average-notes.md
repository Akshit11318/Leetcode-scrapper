## Find the Grid of Region Average

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-grid-of-region-average/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D grid `grid` of integers, and an integer `radius`.
- Constraints: `1 <= grid.length <= 10^2`, `1 <= grid[0].length <= 10^2`, `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^8`, `0 <= radius <= 10^8`.
- Expected output format: A 2D grid of integers, where each cell is the average of the region within the given `radius`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The region of a cell is defined as the set of all cells within `radius` distance from the cell.
  - The average of a region is calculated by summing up all the values in the region and dividing by the number of cells in the region.
  - If a cell is on the edge of the grid, its region may be smaller than the given `radius`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For the input `grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]` and `radius = 1`, the output should be `[[3,3,3],[3,3,3],[3,3,3]]`.
  - For the input `grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]` and `radius = 2`, the output should be `[[5,5,5],[5,5,5],[5,5,5]]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each cell in the grid, calculate the average of the region within the given `radius`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.
  2. For each cell, iterate over all cells within the given `radius`.
  3. Calculate the sum of the values in the region and the number of cells in the region.
  4. Calculate the average of the region by dividing the sum by the number of cells.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach to calculate the average of each region.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> getAverages(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int radius) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> result(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int sum = 0;
            int count = 0;
            for (int x = max(0, i - radius); x <= min(m - 1, i + radius); x++) {
                for (int y = max(0, j - radius); y <= min(n - 1, j + radius); y++) {
                    sum += grid[x][y];
                    count++;
                }
            }
            result[i][j] = sum / count;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n \cdot (2r + 1)^2)$, where $m$ is the number of rows, $n$ is the number of columns, and $r$ is the radius.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity because it calculates the average of each region separately, resulting in a lot of repeated calculations. The space complexity is linear because we need to store the result for each cell.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a prefix sum array to calculate the sum of the region in constant time.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a prefix sum array `prefix` of size $(m + 1) \times (n + 1)$.
  2. Iterate over each cell in the grid and update the prefix sum array.
  3. For each cell, calculate the sum of the region using the prefix sum array.
  4. Calculate the average of the region by dividing the sum by the number of cells in the region.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it reduces the time complexity from $O(m \cdot n \cdot (2r + 1)^2)$ to $O(m \cdot n)$.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> getAverages(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int radius) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> prefix(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    
    // Create prefix sum array
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            prefix[i][j] = prefix[i - 1][j] + prefix[i][j - 1] - prefix[i - 1][j - 1] + grid[i - 1][j - 1];
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate average for each cell
    vector<vector<int>> result(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int x1 = max(0, i - radius);
            int y1 = max(0, j - radius);
            int x2 = min(m - 1, i + radius);
            int y2 = min(n - 1, j + radius);
            int sum = prefix[x2 + 1][y2 + 1] - prefix[x1][y2 + 1] - prefix[x2 + 1][y1] + prefix[x1][y1];
            int count = (x2 - x1 + 1) * (y2 - y1 + 1);
            result[i][j] = sum / count;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```
