## Most Popular Video Creator

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/most-popular-video-creator/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes a list of `creators`, a list of `ids`, and a list of `views` as input. The `creators` list contains the creator of each video, the `ids` list contains the ID of each video, and the `views` list contains the number of views for each video. The goal is to find the most popular video creator based on the number of views.
- Expected output format: The output should be a list of the most popular creators, sorted in lexicographical order.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input lists are of the same length, and each creator has at least one video. If there are multiple creators with the same maximum total views, all of them should be included in the output.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `creators = ["alice","bob","alice","chuck"]`, `ids = ["id1","id2","id3","id4"]`, and `views = [5,10,5,8]`, the output should be `["alice"]` because Alice has the most total views (10).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating over the input lists and calculating the total views for each creator.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a map to store the total views for each creator.
  2. Iterate over the input lists and update the total views for each creator in the map.
  3. Find the maximum total views.
  4. Iterate over the map again to find all creators with the maximum total views.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be efficient for large input lists.

```cpp
vector<string> mostPopularCreator(vector<string>& creators, vector<string>& ids, vector<int>& views) {
    unordered_map<string, int> creatorViews;
    for (int i = 0; i < creators.size(); i++) {
        if (creatorViews.find(creators[i]) != creatorViews.end()) {
            creatorViews[creators[i]] += views[i];
        } else {
            creatorViews[creators[i]] = views[i];
        }
    }
    
    int maxViews = 0;
    for (auto& pair : creatorViews) {
        maxViews = max(maxViews, pair.second);
    }
    
    vector<string> result;
    for (auto& pair : creatorViews) {
        if (pair.second == maxViews) {
            result.push_back(pair.first);
        }
    }
    
    sort(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m \log m)$, where $n$ is the length of the input lists and $m$ is the number of unique creators. The first iteration over the input lists takes $O(n)$ time, and the second iteration over the map takes $O(m)$ time. The sorting step takes $O(m \log m)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input lists. The map stores the total views for each creator, which requires $O(n)$ space in the worst case.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is necessary to ensure the output is in lexicographical order. The space complexity is due to the map, which stores the total views for each creator.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a single pass over the input lists to calculate the total views for each creator and keep track of the maximum total views.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a map to store the total views for each creator.
  2. Iterate over the input lists and update the total views for each creator in the map.
  3. Keep track of the maximum total views and the creators with the maximum total views.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n + m \log m)$, which is optimal because we need to iterate over the input lists at least once to calculate the total views for each creator.

```cpp
vector<string> mostPopularCreator(vector<string>& creators, vector<string>& ids, vector<int>& views) {
    unordered_map<string, int> creatorViews;
    int maxViews = 0;
    vector<string> result;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < creators.size(); i++) {
        if (creatorViews.find(creators[i]) != creatorViews.end()) {
            creatorViews[creators[i]] += views[i];
        } else {
            creatorViews[creators[i]] = views[i];
        }
        
        if (creatorViews[creators[i]] > maxViews) {
            maxViews = creatorViews[creators[i]];
            result.clear();
            result.push_back(creators[i]);
        } else if (creatorViews[creators[i]] == maxViews) {
            result.push_back(creators[i]);
        }
    }
    
    sort(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: iteration over input lists, use of maps to store intermediate results, and sorting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using a single pass over the input lists to calculate the total views for each creator, and keeping track of the maximum total views.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a map to store intermediate results, and sorting the output only once.
- Similar problems to practice: other problems that involve iterating over input lists and calculating intermediate results.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking for edge cases, such as empty input lists, and not handling the case where there are multiple creators with the same maximum total views.
- Edge cases to watch for: empty input lists, and input lists with duplicate creators.
- Performance pitfalls: using inefficient data structures, such as arrays, to store intermediate results, and sorting the output multiple times.
- Testing considerations: testing the function with different input lists, including edge cases, to ensure it produces the correct output.
