## Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-houses-at-a-certain-distance-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `n` (number of houses), `houses` (array of house positions), `k` (distance)
- Expected output: The number of houses at a certain distance `k` from each house
- Key requirements:
  - Calculate the number of houses within distance `k` for each house
  - Consider edge cases: empty `houses` array, `n` equals 0, `k` equals 0
- Example test cases:
  - `n = 5`, `houses = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `k = 2`
  - `n = 10`, `houses = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, `k = 3`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each house, calculate the distance to every other house and count the number of houses within distance `k`.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate over each house in the `houses` array.
  2. For each house, iterate over every other house in the `houses` array.
  3. Calculate the distance between the two houses using the absolute difference of their positions.
  4. If the distance is less than or equal to `k`, increment the count for the current house.
  5. After iterating over all houses, return the count for each house.

```cpp
vector<int> countHouses(int n, vector<int>& houses, int k) {
    vector<int> count(n, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i != j && abs(houses[i] - houses[j]) <= k) {
                count[i]++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of houses. This is because we have two nested loops, each iterating over all houses.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store the count for each house.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity due to the nested loops, making it inefficient for large inputs.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can use a single loop to iterate over the houses and use a sliding window approach to count the number of houses within distance `k`.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a vector `count` to store the count for each house.
  2. Iterate over each house in the `houses` array.
  3. For each house, use a sliding window approach to count the number of houses within distance `k`.
  4. After iterating over all houses, return the `count` vector.

```cpp
vector<int> countHouses(int n, vector<int>& houses, int k) {
    vector<int> count(n, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int left = i - k;
        int right = i + k;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (j != i && houses[j] >= houses[i] - k && houses[j] <= houses[i] + k) {
                count[i]++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

However, the optimal solution can be further optimized using sorting and binary search.

```cpp
vector<int> countHouses(int n, vector<int>& houses, int k) {
    vector<int> count(n, 0);
    sort(houses.begin(), houses.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int left = lower_bound(houses.begin(), houses.end(), houses[i] - k) - houses.begin();
        int right = upper_bound(houses.begin(), houses.end(), houses[i] + k) - houses.begin();
        count[i] = right - left - 1; // subtract 1 to exclude the current house
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of houses. This is because we sort the `houses` array and use binary search to find the bounds.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store the count for each house.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach has a lower time complexity than the brute force approach, making it more efficient for large inputs.
