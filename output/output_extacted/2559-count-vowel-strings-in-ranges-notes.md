## Count Vowel Strings in Ranges

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-vowel-strings-in-ranges/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A list of strings `words` and a list of integer pairs `queries`.
- Output: A list of integers, where each integer at index `i` is the number of strings in `words` that are vowel strings and satisfy the query at index `i`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - A string is considered a vowel string if it contains only vowels.
    - A query is satisfied if the string length is between the given range.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - If `words = ["apple","app","a","banana","bat"]` and `queries = [[0,2],[0,3],[0,4]]`, then the output should be `[2,3,4]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over each query and for each query, iterate over each word to check if it satisfies the query conditions.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. For each query, initialize a counter for vowel strings.
    2. For each word, check if it is a vowel string by verifying that all its characters are vowels.
    3. If the word is a vowel string, check if its length satisfies the query range.
    4. If both conditions are met, increment the counter for the current query.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by checking each word against each query.

```cpp
vector<int> vowelStrings(vector<string>& words, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = query[0]; i <= query[1]; ++i) {
            bool isVowelString = true;
            for (char c : words[i]) {
                if (c != 'a' && c != 'e' && c != 'i' && c != 'o' && c != 'u') {
                    isVowelString = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isVowelString) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        result.push_back(count);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(q \cdot n \cdot m)$ where $q$ is the number of queries, $n$ is the average number of words to check per query, and $m$ is the average length of a word. This is because for each query, we potentially check every word, and for each word, we check every character.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(q)$ for storing the result of each query.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The nested loops over queries, words, and characters lead to the time complexity. The space complexity is due to storing the results of each query.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Preprocess the `words` array to mark which indices contain vowel strings, then use this preprocessing to quickly answer each query.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Create a boolean array `isVowel` of the same length as `words`, where `isVowel[i]` is `true` if `words[i]` is a vowel string.
    2. For each query, count the number of `true` values in the `isVowel` array within the query's range.
- Proof of optimality: This approach reduces the time complexity by avoiding the need to check if a word is a vowel string for each query.

```cpp
vector<int> vowelStrings(vector<string>& words, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<bool> isVowel(words.size());
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
        bool isVowelString = true;
        for (char c : words[i]) {
            if (c != 'a' && c != 'e' && c != 'i' && c != 'o' && c != 'u') {
                isVowelString = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        isVowel[i] = isVowelString;
    }
    
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = query[0]; i <= query[1]; ++i) {
            if (isVowel[i]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        result.push_back(count);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m + q \cdot n)$ where $n$ is the number of words and $m$ is the average length of a word. The preprocessing step takes $O(n \cdot m)$, and answering each query takes $O(n)$ in the worst case, leading to $O(q \cdot n)$ for all queries.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for the `isVowel` array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we must at least read the input and write the output, and our preprocessing step allows us to avoid redundant work when checking if a word is a vowel string for each query.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Preprocessing, query optimization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Reducing redundant computation through preprocessing.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary work by preprocessing data.
- Similar problems to practice: Other query-based problems where preprocessing can reduce computation time.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to validate input indices, not handling edge cases correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Queries with invalid or out-of-range indices, empty input arrays.
- Performance pitfalls: Not optimizing the query answering process, leading to high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various query ranges and word combinations to cover all edge cases.
