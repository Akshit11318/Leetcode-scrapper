## Count of Matches in Tournament

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-matches-in-tournament/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an integer `n`, representing the number of teams in a tournament.
- Expected output format: The output should be the total number of matches played in the tournament.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The tournament is a single-elimination tournament, meaning each match eliminates one team, and the tournament continues until only one team remains.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For `n = 2`, there is 1 match, as only two teams are playing, and one match determines the winner.
    - For `n = 7`, there are 6 matches because the tournament structure will have 7 teams competing in a single-elimination format, requiring 6 matches to determine the winner.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is simulating the tournament. However, this problem does not require simulating the actual matches but rather understanding the structure of a single-elimination tournament.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: We start with `n` teams and eliminate one team per match. The tournament continues until only one team remains, meaning `n-1` matches are played.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem by considering the elimination process in a tournament.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        // Initialize the number of matches
        int matches = 0;
        
        // Continue the tournament until only one team remains
        while (n > 1) {
            // In each round, the number of matches is half the number of teams
            matches += n / 2;
            // The number of teams is reduced by half after each round
            n = n / 2;
        }
        
        return matches;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of teams. This is because with each iteration, the number of teams is halved, similar to a binary search.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space to store the number of matches and teams.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is logarithmic because we divide the problem size by 2 with each iteration, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Recognizing that the number of matches in a single-elimination tournament is one less than the number of teams. This is because each match eliminates one team, and all but one team must be eliminated.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The formula to calculate the number of matches is simply `n-1`, where `n` is the number of teams.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the result without any unnecessary operations, achieving a constant time complexity.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This solution is already at its simplest form, requiring only a single operation to calculate the result.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        // The number of matches in a single-elimination tournament is n-1
        return n - 1;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, which is constant time. This is because we perform a single operation regardless of the input size.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution is optimal because it calculates the result in constant time with a single operation, which is the most efficient way to solve this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Understanding the structure of a single-elimination tournament and recognizing patterns that lead to efficient solutions.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Looking for direct calculations or formulas that can simplify the solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Simplifying the problem by identifying the key insight that leads to the optimal solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving tournaments or competitions where understanding the structure can lead to efficient solutions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Overcomplicating the solution by simulating the tournament instead of recognizing the direct formula.
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring the solution works for small inputs (e.g., `n = 2`) and large inputs.
- Performance pitfalls: Failing to recognize the logarithmic or constant time complexity solutions and instead opting for less efficient approaches.
- Testing considerations: Testing with various inputs to ensure the solution works correctly for different tournament sizes.
