## Create a DataFrame from List

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/create-a-dataframe-from-list/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem requires creating a DataFrame from a given list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the DataFrame. The input list can contain any type of data, including integers, strings, and floats.
- Expected output format: The expected output is a pandas DataFrame created from the input list.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The solution should handle empty lists, lists with varying lengths, and lists containing different data types.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`
  - Output: A pandas DataFrame with three rows and three columns.
  - Input: `[["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e", "f"], ["g", "h", "i"]]`
  - Output: A pandas DataFrame with three rows and three columns.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward approach is to directly create a pandas DataFrame from the input list using the `pd.DataFrame()` function.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Import the pandas library.
  2. Create a pandas DataFrame from the input list using `pd.DataFrame()`.
  3. Return the created DataFrame.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is the most straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
// Note: The problem statement is in Python, not C++. 
// Here is the equivalent code in Python:
import pandas as pd

def create_dataframe(input_list):
    # Create a pandas DataFrame from the input list
    df = pd.DataFrame(input_list)
    return df
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of rows and $m$ is the number of columns in the input list. This is because creating a pandas DataFrame involves iterating over each element in the input list.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, as the created DataFrame requires memory to store all the elements from the input list.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time and space complexities are due to the iteration over the input list and the storage of the created DataFrame, respectively.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach, as creating a pandas DataFrame from a list is a straightforward and efficient operation.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same steps as in the brute force approach apply.
- Proof of optimality: The optimal approach is the most efficient way to create a pandas DataFrame from a list, as it directly utilizes the optimized `pd.DataFrame()` function.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is not possible, as the `pd.DataFrame()` function is already optimized for performance.

```python
import pandas as pd

def create_dataframe(input_list):
    # Create a pandas DataFrame from the input list
    df = pd.DataFrame(input_list)
    return df
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of rows and $m$ is the number of columns in the input list.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, as the created DataFrame requires memory to store all the elements from the input list.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach is the most efficient way to create a pandas DataFrame from a list, as it directly utilizes the optimized `pd.DataFrame()` function.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem demonstrates the use of pandas DataFrames and the `pd.DataFrame()` function.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires a straightforward approach to creating a pandas DataFrame from a list.
- Optimization techniques learned: The problem does not require any optimization techniques beyond using the optimized `pd.DataFrame()` function.
