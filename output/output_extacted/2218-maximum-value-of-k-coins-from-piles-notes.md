## Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-of-k-coins-from-piles/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of piles where each pile contains a list of integers representing the values of coins in the pile, and an integer k, find the maximum value of k coins from the piles.
- Expected output format: The maximum value of k coins that can be obtained.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The piles are non-empty and k is within the range of the number of coins in the piles.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - Input: `piles = [[100], [100], [100], [100], [100], [100], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 700]], k = 7`
      Output: `1740`
    - Input: `piles = [[100, 100], [100, 100], [100, 100], [100, 100], [100, 100], [100, 100], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 700]], k = 7`
      Output: `1740`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of coins from the piles.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of k coins from the piles.
  2. For each combination, calculate the total value.
  3. Keep track of the maximum value found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to explore all possibilities, but it's not efficient due to its high complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int max_value(vector<vector<int>>& piles, int k) {
    int n = piles.size();
    int max_val = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        if (__builtin_popcount(mask) == k) {
            int val = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (mask & (1 << i)) {
                    val += piles[i].back();
                }
            }
            max_val = max(max_val, val);
        }
    }
    return max_val;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where n is the number of piles. This is because we generate all possible combinations of piles (2^n) and for each combination, we iterate over the piles to calculate the total value.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum value and the current combination.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity is due to the brute force nature of the approach, where we explore all possible combinations of piles.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a dynamic programming approach to store the maximum value of coins for each pile and each number of coins.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the coins in each pile in descending order.
  2. Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum value of j coins from the first i piles.
  3. Initialize the first row of dp with the maximum value of coins from the first pile.
  4. For each subsequent row, iterate over the number of coins and update dp[i][j] with the maximum value of coins from the current pile and the previous piles.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of coins from the piles and store the maximum value for each number of coins.

```cpp
int max_value(vector<vector<int>>& piles, int k) {
    int n = piles.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int m = piles[i - 1].size();
        vector<int> prefix(m + 1, 0);
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            prefix[j] = prefix[j - 1] + piles[i - 1][m - j];
        }
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
            for (int x = 0; x <= min(j, m); x++) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - x] + prefix[x]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][k];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k \cdot m)$, where n is the number of piles, k is the number of coins, and m is the maximum number of coins in a pile. This is because we iterate over the piles, the number of coins, and the coins in each pile.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, as we use a 2D array to store the maximum value of coins for each pile and each number of coins.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of coins from the piles and store the maximum value for each number of coins, resulting in the optimal solution.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, sorting, and iteration.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a 2D array to store the maximum value of coins for each pile and each number of coins.
- Optimization techniques learned: Sorting the coins in each pile in descending order and using a prefix sum array to calculate the maximum value of coins.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the knapsack problem or the subset sum problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the first row of the dp array correctly or not updating the dp array correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: When the number of coins is 0 or when the number of piles is 0.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a prefix sum array to calculate the maximum value of coins, resulting in a higher time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, such as different numbers of piles, coins, and values, to ensure that it works correctly.
