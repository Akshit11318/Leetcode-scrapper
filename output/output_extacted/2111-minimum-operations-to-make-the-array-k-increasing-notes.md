## Minimum Operations to Make the Array K-Increasing
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-k-increasing/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`, find the minimum number of operations to make the array k-increasing.
- The array is k-increasing if for each `i`, `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - k]`.
- The only allowed operation is to increment any element of the array by 1.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of operations to make the array k-increasing.

**Input Format and Constraints:**
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= arr.length`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

**Expected Output Format:**
- The minimum number of operations to make the array k-increasing.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases to Consider:**
- The array can be empty, in which case no operations are needed.
- `k` can be equal to the length of the array, in which case the array is already k-increasing if it is non-decreasing.

**Example Test Cases with Explanations:**
- `arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, `k = 1`: The array is not k-increasing, and we need to increment each element by 1 to make it non-decreasing. The minimum number of operations is 10.
- `arr = [4, 1, 5, 3, 2]`, `k = 2`: The array is not k-increasing, and we need to increment some elements to make it 2-increasing. The minimum number of operations is 3.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of increments to make the array k-increasing.
- We can use a recursive approach to try all possible increments for each element.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kIncreasing(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int res = INT_MAX;
        vector<int> tmp = arr;
        
        function<void(int, int)> dfs = [&](int idx, int cnt) {
            if (idx == n) {
                res = min(res, cnt);
                return;
            }
            if (idx >= k - 1) {
                int prev = tmp[idx - k + 1];
                for (int i = prev; i <= tmp[idx]; i++) {
                    tmp[idx] = i;
                    dfs(idx + 1, cnt + i - arr[idx]);
                }
            } else {
                dfs(idx + 1, cnt);
            }
        };
        
        dfs(0, 0);
        return res;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot 10^9)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. This is because in the worst case, we need to try all possible increments for each element.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. This is because we need to store the temporary array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations of increments, which leads to an exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we need to store the temporary array.

### Optimal Approach
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
- We can maintain a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations to make the subarray `arr[i - k + 1..i]` k-increasing.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kIncreasing(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> dp(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int prev = i >= k ? arr[i - k] : -1;
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int j = i - 1; j >= i - k + 1; j--) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[i]) {
                    prev = arr[j];
                }
                if (prev != -1 && arr[j] < prev) {
                    cnt += prev - arr[j];
                    prev = prev;
                } else {
                    prev = arr[j];
                }
            }
            dp[i] = cnt;
        }
        
        int res = *min_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
        return res;
    }
};
```

However, the optimal solution uses a **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** approach. The idea is to find the length of the LIS in the array `arr` when considering every `k`-th element.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kIncreasing(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> res(k);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            vector<int> dp;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j += k) {
                auto it = lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), arr[j]);
                if (it == dp.end()) {
                    dp.push_back(arr[j]);
                } else {
                    *it = arr[j];
                }
            }
            res[i] = dp.size();
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            sum += res[i];
        }
        return n - sum;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. This is because we use a binary search approach to find the position to insert the element in the LIS.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. This is because we need to store the LIS.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach uses a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum number of operations to make the array k-increasing. The LIS approach is optimal because it finds the maximum number of elements that can be kept without incrementing, which minimizes the number of operations.
