## Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/keep-multiplying-found-values-by-two/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` and an integer `initialValue`.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 50`, `s` consists of lowercase English letters and digits, `1 <= initialValue <= 10^5`.
- Expected output: The result of the operation described in the problem statement.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling non-numeric characters, multiple occurrences of the same digit, and the possibility of `initialValue` exceeding the maximum limit during the operation.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `s = "leetcode", initialValue = 7`, expected output: `72`.
- `s = "a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9", initialValue = 1`, expected output: `256`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through the string `s`, and whenever a digit is found, multiply the current `initialValue` by 2.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the result, starting with `initialValue`.
  2. Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
  3. Check if the character is a digit.
  4. If it is, multiply the current result by 2.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the problem statement without considering any optimizations.

```cpp
int findFinalValue(string s, int initialValue) {
    for (char c : s) {
        if (isdigit(c)) {
            initialValue *= 2;
        }
    }
    return initialValue;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate through the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we only use a constant amount of space to store the result and do not use any data structures that scale with input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The iteration through the string causes the linear time complexity, and the constant space usage is due to only using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem does not require us to keep track of any additional information other than the current `initialValue`. Thus, the brute force approach is already optimal in terms of time complexity because it must at least read the input string once.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same as the brute force approach, as no further optimization is possible without changing the problem's requirements.
- Proof of optimality: Any algorithm must read the input at least once to determine the occurrences of digits, making $O(n)$ the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
int findFinalValue(string s, int initialValue) {
    for (char c : s) {
        if (isdigit(c)) {
            initialValue *= 2;
        }
    }
    return initialValue;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of space is used.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most efficient algorithm possible because it must at least read the input string once, and it does so in linear time with constant space usage.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional checks, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct implementation of problem statements without considering optimizations first.
- Optimization techniques learned: Recognizing when the initial approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation and basic arithmetic problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty string or `initialValue` being outside the specified range.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling non-numeric characters and ensuring the result does not exceed the maximum limit.
- Performance pitfalls: Assuming a more complex solution is needed when the problem can be solved with a simple, direct approach.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with different inputs, including edge cases and boundary values.
