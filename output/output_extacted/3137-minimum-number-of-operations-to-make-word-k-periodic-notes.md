## Minimum Number of Operations to Make Word K-Periodic
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-word-k-periodic/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `word` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= k <= word.length <= 1000`.
- Expected output: The minimum number of operations to make `word` k-periodic.
- Key requirements: To make a word k-periodic, it must have the same sequence of characters repeating every k characters.
- Edge cases: When `word.length` is exactly divisible by `k`, and when `word.length` is not divisible by `k`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible substrings of length `k` and count the number of operations needed to make the rest of the string match this substring.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all substrings of length `k`.
  2. For each substring, count the number of operations needed to make the rest of the string match this substring.
  3. Return the minimum count.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that considers all possibilities.

```cpp
int minOperations(string word, int k) {
    int n = word.length();
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all substrings of length k
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
        string substr = word.substr(i, k);
        int ops = 0;
        
        // Count the number of operations needed to make the rest of the string match this substring
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (word[j] != substr[j % k]) {
                ops++;
            }
        }
        
        minOps = min(minOps, ops);
    }
    
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the string and $k$ is the period. This is because we generate all substrings of length $k$ and for each substring, we count the number of operations needed to make the rest of the string match this substring.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, where $k$ is the period. This is because we need to store the substring of length $k$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we use nested loops to generate all substrings and count the number of operations. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the substring.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of generating all substrings of length `k`, we can use the fact that the word is k-periodic if and only if the first `k` characters are repeated throughout the string.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable `ops` to 0.
  2. For each character in the string, check if it matches the corresponding character in the first `k` characters.
  3. If it doesn't match, increment `ops`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only needs to iterate through the string once, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$.

```cpp
int minOperations(string word, int k) {
    int n = word.length();
    int ops = 0;
    
    // Check if each character matches the corresponding character in the first k characters
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (word[i] != word[i % k]) {
            ops++;
        }
    }
    
    return ops;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we only need to iterate through the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only need to use a constant amount of space to store the variable `ops`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only needs to iterate through the string once, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, string manipulation, and optimization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using the properties of k-periodic words to simplify the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary iterations and using the fact that the word is k-periodic to reduce the number of operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving string manipulation and optimization.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as when `word.length` is exactly divisible by `k`.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `word.length` is not divisible by `k`, and when `k` is greater than `word.length`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary iterations or not optimizing the solution.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different inputs and edge cases to ensure it works correctly.
