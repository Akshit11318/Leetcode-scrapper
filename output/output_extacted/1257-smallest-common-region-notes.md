## Smallest Common Region

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-common-region/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input consists of four lists of strings representing the regions where four people live. Each person has a list of regions where they live. We need to find the smallest common region among all four people.
- Expected output format: The output should be the smallest common region.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  * If there are multiple common regions with the same length, we should return the one that comes first alphabetically.
  * We should handle the case where there is no common region.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  * For example, if the input is `[["Earth","North America","South America"],["North America","United States","Canada"],["South America","Brazil"],["Brazil","Amazonas"]],` the output should be `"Brazil"`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to compare each region of one person with each region of the other three people to find the common regions.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each region of the first person.
  2. For each region of the first person, iterate over each region of the other three people.
  3. If a region is common to all four people, add it to the list of common regions.
  4. Finally, return the smallest common region.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it has a high time complexity due to the nested iterations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findSmallestRegion(vector<vector<string>>& regions, string region1, string region2) {
        // Create a set of regions for each person
        unordered_set<string> person1, person2, person3, person4;
        for (const auto& region : regions[0]) person1.insert(region);
        for (const auto& region : regions[1]) person2.insert(region);
        for (const auto& region : regions[2]) person3.insert(region);
        for (const auto& region : regions[3]) person4.insert(region);
        
        // Initialize the smallest common region
        string smallestCommonRegion = "";
        
        // Iterate over each region of the first person
        for (const auto& region : person1) {
            // Check if the region is common to all four people
            if (person2.find(region) != person2.end() && person3.find(region) != person3.end() && person4.find(region) != person4.end()) {
                // If this is the first common region or it's smaller than the current smallest common region, update the smallest common region
                if (smallestCommonRegion.empty() || region.length() < smallestCommonRegion.length() || (region.length() == smallestCommonRegion.length() && region < smallestCommonRegion)) {
                    smallestCommonRegion = region;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return smallestCommonRegion;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^4)$ where $n$ is the number of regions for each person. This is because we have four nested iterations over the regions.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of regions for each person. This is because we store the regions in sets.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity occurs because of the brute force approach with nested iterations. The space complexity occurs because we store the regions in sets.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a `unordered_map` to store the regions and their frequencies. Then, we can iterate over the regions and find the common ones.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a `unordered_map` to store the regions and their frequencies.
  2. Iterate over the regions of each person and update the frequencies in the map.
  3. Iterate over the map and find the regions with frequency 4 (i.e., the common regions).
  4. Finally, return the smallest common region.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a lower time complexity than the brute force approach because we only iterate over the regions once.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because we only iterate over the regions once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findSmallestRegion(vector<vector<string>>& regions, string region1, string region2) {
        // Create a map to store the regions and their frequencies
        unordered_map<string, int> regionFrequency;
        
        // Iterate over the regions of each person and update the frequencies in the map
        for (const auto& regionList : regions) {
            for (const auto& region : regionList) {
                regionFrequency[region]++;
            }
        }
        
        // Initialize the smallest common region
        string smallestCommonRegion = "";
        
        // Iterate over the map and find the regions with frequency 4 (i.e., the common regions)
        for (const auto& pair : regionFrequency) {
            if (pair.second == 4) {
                // If this is the first common region or it's smaller than the current smallest common region, update the smallest common region
                if (smallestCommonRegion.empty() || pair.first.length() < smallestCommonRegion.length() || (pair.first.length() == smallestCommonRegion.length() && pair.first < smallestCommonRegion)) {
                    smallestCommonRegion = pair.first;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return smallestCommonRegion;
    }
};
```

- Edge cases to watch for: 
  * Empty input lists
  * Input lists with different lengths
- Performance pitfalls: 
  * Using a brute force approach with high time complexity
  * Not using a map to store frequencies, resulting in higher time complexity
- Testing considerations: 
  * Testing with different input sizes and edge cases
  * Testing with different types of input (e.g., strings, integers)
