## Maximum Number of Groups with Increasing Length
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-groups-with-increasing-length/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `groups` representing the number of groups and an integer `minSize` representing the minimum size of the first group.
- Constraints: `1 <= groups <= 1000`, `1 <= minSize <= groups`.
- Expected Output: The maximum number of groups that can be formed with increasing length.
- Key Requirements: The size of each group should be greater than the previous group.
- Edge Cases: Handle cases where it's impossible to form groups with increasing length.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Start with the minimum size for the first group and try to form subsequent groups with increasing sizes.
- Check all possible combinations of group sizes that satisfy the condition of increasing lengths.
- Keep track of the maximum number of groups that can be formed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxGroups(int groups, int minSize) {
        int maxSize = groups;
        int maxGroupCount = 0;
        for (int size = minSize; size <= maxSize; size++) {
            int remaining = groups - size;
            int groupCount = 1;
            int nextSize = size + 1;
            while (remaining >= nextSize) {
                remaining -= nextSize;
                groupCount++;
                nextSize++;
            }
            maxGroupCount = max(maxGroupCount, groupCount);
        }
        return maxGroupCount;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of groups. This is because we have a nested loop structure where the outer loop iterates over possible group sizes, and the inner loop tries to form as many groups as possible with increasing sizes.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store variables like `maxGroupCount`, `remaining`, and `nextSize`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks all possible combinations of group sizes, leading to a quadratic time complexity. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The problem can be solved using a mathematical approach. The maximum number of groups can be formed when the size of each group increases by 1.
- We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the maximum number of groups.
- The sum of the first $n$ natural numbers is given by $S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.
- We want to find the largest $n$ such that $S_n \leq groups$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxGroups(int groups, int minSize) {
        int n = (int)sqrt(2.0 * groups);
        while ((n * (n + 1)) / 2 > groups) {
            n--;
        }
        int maxSize = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
        if (minSize > maxSize) return 0;
        return n;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the number of groups. This is because we use a while loop that runs until we find the largest $n$ that satisfies the condition.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store variables like `n` and `maxSize`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a mathematical formula to find the maximum number of groups, eliminating the need for brute force checking of all possible combinations.
