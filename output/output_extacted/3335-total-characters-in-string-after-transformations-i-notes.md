## Total Characters in String After Transformations I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/total-characters-in-string-after-transformations-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters and spaces.
- Expected output format: The function should return the total number of characters in the string after transformations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The transformations involve replacing each word with its length as a string, and the input string can be empty or contain multiple spaces.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `s = "hello world"`
  - Output: `8`
  - Explanation: After replacing each word with its length as a string, the resulting string is `"5 5"`, which has a total of 8 characters.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first step is to split the input string into words, then for each word, replace it with its length as a string.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Split the input string into words using spaces as delimiters.
  2. For each word, calculate its length and convert it to a string.
  3. Join all the word lengths (as strings) back together with spaces in between.
  4. Calculate the total number of characters in the resulting string.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly follows the problem's description.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>

int totalCharacters(const std::string& s) {
    std::istringstream iss(s);
    std::string word;
    std::vector<std::string> wordLengths;

    // Split the input string into words and calculate their lengths
    while (iss >> word) {
        std::string lengthStr = std::to_string(word.length());
        wordLengths.push_back(lengthStr);
    }

    // Join the word lengths back together with spaces
    std::string result;
    for (const auto& lengthStr : wordLengths) {
        result += lengthStr + " ";
    }

    // Remove the trailing space
    if (!result.empty()) {
        result.pop_back();
    }

    // Return the total number of characters in the resulting string
    return result.length();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of characters in the input string, because we process each character once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might need to store all characters in the `wordLengths` vector and the `result` string.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we iterate through the input string once to split it into words and then process each word. The space complexity is also linear because we store the lengths of all words and the resulting string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of joining all word lengths back together into a string and then calculating the total number of characters, we can simply sum up the lengths of the word lengths (as strings) plus the number of spaces in between.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Split the input string into words.
  2. For each word, calculate its length and convert it to a string.
  3. Sum up the lengths of all word lengths (as strings).
  4. Add the number of spaces in between words to the total sum.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it avoids the unnecessary step of joining all word lengths back into a string, reducing the space complexity.

```cpp
int totalCharacters(const std::string& s) {
    std::istringstream iss(s);
    std::string word;
    int totalLength = 0;

    // Split the input string into words and calculate their lengths
    while (iss >> word) {
        std::string lengthStr = std::to_string(word.length());
        totalLength += lengthStr.length() + 1; // +1 for the space
    }

    // Subtract 1 because we added an extra space at the end
    if (totalLength > 0) {
        totalLength -= 1;
    }

    return totalLength;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of characters in the input string, because we process each character once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the `totalLength` and other variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we minimize both time and space complexities by avoiding unnecessary string operations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: String processing, word splitting, and character counting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Avoiding unnecessary string operations to optimize space complexity.
- Optimization techniques learned: Calculating the total length directly instead of joining strings and then calculating the length.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string processing problems that involve transformations and counting.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty input strings or strings with multiple consecutive spaces.
- Edge cases to watch for: Input strings with non-ASCII characters or very large input strings that could cause performance issues.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient string operations that could lead to high time or space complexities.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with various input cases to ensure correctness and performance.
