## Task Scheduler II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem provides a list of tasks and their corresponding cooldown periods. The goal is to find the minimum number of days required to complete all tasks without violating the cooldown constraints.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of days required to complete all tasks.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The cooldown period for each task, the number of tasks, and the possibility of having multiple tasks with the same cooldown period.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - `tasks = [1, 2, 1], cooldown = 2` should return `4` because the task sequence is `1 -> idle -> 2 -> idle -> 1`.
    - `tasks = [1, 1, 2, 1], cooldown = 2` should return `7` because the task sequence is `1 -> idle -> 1 -> idle -> 2 -> idle -> 1`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves simulating the task execution process by iterating through the tasks and applying the cooldown constraints.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize a `days` counter to keep track of the minimum number of days required.
    2. Initialize a `task_count` map to store the frequency of each task.
    3. Iterate through the tasks and apply the cooldown constraints.
    4. For each task, increment the `days` counter by the cooldown period if the task has been executed recently.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it has an exponential time complexity due to the recursive nature of the task execution process.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

int taskSchedulerII(std::vector<int>& tasks, int cooldown) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> task_count;
    int days = 0;
    for (int task : tasks) {
        if (task_count.find(task) != task_count.end()) {
            if (task_count[task] > days - cooldown) {
                days += cooldown - (days - task_count[task]);
            }
        }
        task_count[task] = days + 1;
        days++;
    }
    return days;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of tasks, because we iterate through the tasks once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of tasks, because we use a map to store the frequency of each task.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we iterate through the tasks once, and the space complexity is linear because we use a map to store the frequency of each task.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using a priority queue to store the tasks that are ready to be executed.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Initialize a `days` counter to keep track of the minimum number of days required.
    2. Initialize a `task_count` map to store the frequency of each task.
    3. Initialize a priority queue to store the tasks that are ready to be executed.
    4. Iterate through the tasks and apply the cooldown constraints.
    5. For each task, increment the `days` counter by the cooldown period if the task has been executed recently.
- Proof of optimality: The optimal solution has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>

int taskSchedulerII(std::vector<int>& tasks, int cooldown) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> task_count;
    std::queue<std::pair<int, int>> ready_tasks;
    int days = 0;
    for (int task : tasks) {
        if (task_count.find(task) != task_count.end()) {
            if (task_count[task] > days - cooldown) {
                days += cooldown - (days - task_count[task]);
            }
        }
        task_count[task] = days + 1;
        ready_tasks.push({task, days + cooldown});
        days++;
        if (!ready_tasks.empty() && ready_tasks.front().second <= days) {
            ready_tasks.pop();
        }
    }
    return days;
}
```
