## Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/final-array-state-after-k-multiplication-operations-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: We are given an array `initial` and an integer `k`. The array `initial` has `2n` elements where `n` is a positive integer.
- Expected output format: The final state of the array after `k` operations, where in each operation, we multiply the first `n` elements and the last `n` elements separately.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: We need to handle cases where `k` is 0 or when `initial` has less than 2 elements.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `initial = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `k = 2`, the output should be `[4, 8, 6, 8]` because:
    1. First operation: Multiply the first two elements (`1*2 = 2`) and the last two elements (`3*4 = 12`), and replace them in the array to get `[2, 2, 12, 12]`.
    2. Second operation: Multiply the first two elements (`2*2 = 4`) and the last two elements (`12*12 = 144`), and replace them in the array to get `[4, 8, 6, 8]` after taking the first digit of each product (`4` and `6`).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to simulate each operation `k` times. In each operation, we calculate the product of the first `n` elements and the product of the last `n` elements, and then update the array accordingly.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Calculate the size of the array `n`.
  2. For `k` times, perform the operation:
    - Calculate the product of the first `n` elements and the last `n` elements.
    - Update the first `n` elements with the product of the first `n` elements and the last `n` elements with the product of the last `n` elements.
  3. Return the updated array.

```cpp
vector<int> finalState(vector<int>& initial, int k) {
    int n = initial.size() / 2;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        long long firstProduct = 1;
        long long secondProduct = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            firstProduct *= initial[j];
            secondProduct *= initial[n + j];
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            initial[j] = firstProduct % 10;
            initial[n + j] = secondProduct % 10;
        }
    }
    return initial;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n)$, where $k$ is the number of operations and $n$ is half the size of the array, because in each operation, we iterate over the first and last `n` elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are modifying the input array in place and using a constant amount of space to store the products and loop variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear with respect to the number of operations and the size of the array because we perform a constant amount of work for each element in each operation. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store our variables, regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Since we are only interested in the last digit of the product, we can use the property of modular arithmetic that $(a \cdot b) \mod m = ((a \mod m) \cdot (b \mod m)) \mod m$ to avoid large intermediate results. Additionally, because the last digit of any number's product only depends on the last digit of the numbers being multiplied, we can simplify our calculation to only consider the last digit of each number in the array.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the size of the array `n`.
  2. Initialize the products of the first and last `n` elements to 1.
  3. For each element in the first and last `n` elements, multiply the corresponding product by the last digit of the element.
  4. Update the first `n` elements with the last digit of the product of the first `n` elements and the last `n` elements with the last digit of the product of the last `n` elements.
  5. Repeat steps 3-4 for `k` times.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to calculate the final state of the array. By only considering the last digit of each product, we avoid unnecessary calculations and reduce the risk of overflow.

```cpp
vector<int> finalState(vector<int>& initial, int k) {
    int n = initial.size() / 2;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        int firstProduct = 1;
        int secondProduct = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            firstProduct = (firstProduct * (initial[j] % 10)) % 10;
            secondProduct = (secondProduct * (initial[n + j] % 10)) % 10;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            initial[j] = firstProduct;
            initial[n + j] = secondProduct;
        }
    }
    return initial;
}
```
