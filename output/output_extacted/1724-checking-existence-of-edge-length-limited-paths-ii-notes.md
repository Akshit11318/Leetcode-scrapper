## Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/checking-existence-of-edge-length-limited-paths-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges, where each edge has a length. The task is to determine whether there is a path between two nodes within a certain distance limit.
- Expected output format: The solution should provide a boolean array indicating whether a path exists between each pair of nodes within the given distance limit.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where the graph is not connected, nodes have no edges, or the distance limit is zero.
- Example test cases with explanations: Test cases should cover various scenarios, including connected and disconnected graphs, different distance limits, and edge cases like zero distance limit or no edges.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward approach is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths between each pair of nodes and check if any path's total length is within the given distance limit.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over all pairs of nodes.
  2. For each pair, perform a BFS or DFS to find all possible paths.
  3. Calculate the total length of each path.
  4. Check if any path's length is within the given distance limit.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem by exploring all possible paths and checking their lengths.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Define a structure for an edge
struct Edge {
    int node;
    int length;
};

// Function to check if a path exists within the distance limit using BFS
bool bfs(const vector<vector<Edge>>& graph, int start, int end, int limit) {
    queue<pair<int, int>> q; // Queue for BFS, storing node and current path length
    vector<bool> visited(graph.size(), false); // Visited nodes

    q.push({start, 0}); // Start with the start node and a path length of 0
    visited[start] = true;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int currentNode = q.front().first;
        int currentLength = q.front().second;
        q.pop();

        if (currentNode == end) {
            return currentLength <= limit; // If we reached the end node within the limit, return true
        }

        for (const auto& edge : graph[currentNode]) {
            if (!visited[edge.node] && currentLength + edge.length <= limit) {
                q.push({edge.node, currentLength + edge.length});
                visited[edge.node] = true;
            }
        }
    }

    return false; // If no path is found within the limit, return false
}

// Brute force approach function
vector<bool> bruteForce(vector<vector<Edge>>& graph, int n, vector<int>& queries, int limit) {
    vector<bool> results;

    for (int query : queries) {
        int start = query / n;
        int end = query % n;

        bool result = bfs(graph, start, end, limit);
        results.push_back(result);
    }

    return results;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n^2)$, where $m$ is the number of queries and $n$ is the number of nodes, because for each query, we potentially explore all nodes and edges.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, for storing the graph and the visited nodes during BFS.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach explores all possible paths for each query, leading to high time complexity. The space complexity is due to the storage needed for the graph and temporary data structures during the search.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Utilize a union-find data structure to efficiently manage connected components and a priority queue to process edges in ascending order of their lengths.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort all edges by their lengths.
  2. Initialize a union-find data structure to keep track of connected components.
  3. Iterate through the sorted edges, adding each edge to the union-find structure if it does not form a cycle.
  4. For each query, use the union-find structure to check if the start and end nodes are in the same connected component and if the maximum edge length in the path between them does not exceed the limit.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that we only consider the minimum spanning tree of the graph, which minimizes the total length of edges used, and we process edges in order of increasing length, which allows us to efficiently determine connectivity and path lengths.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Define a structure for an edge
struct Edge {
    int node1;
    int node2;
    int length;
};

// Union-find data structure
class UnionFind {
public:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;

    UnionFind(int n) : parent(n), rank(n, 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    void unionNodes(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);

        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
};

// Optimal approach function
vector<bool> optimalApproach(vector<Edge>& edges, int n, vector<int>& queries, int limit) {
    // Sort edges by length
    sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(), [](const Edge& a, const Edge& b) {
        return a.length < b.length;
    });

    UnionFind uf(n);
    vector<bool> results(queries.size());

    for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); ++i) {
        int query = queries[i];
        int start = query / n;
        int end = query % n;

        // Process edges up to the limit
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            if (edge.length > limit) break;
            uf.unionNodes(edge.node1, edge.node2);
        }

        // Check connectivity
        results[i] = (uf.find(start) == uf.find(end));
    }

    return results;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \log m + n + q \cdot \alpha(n))$, where $m$ is the number of edges, $n$ is the number of nodes, $q$ is the number of queries, and $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly. This is because we sort the edges and then process each query using the union-find data structure.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, for storing the graph, the union-find data structure, and temporary data.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach minimizes the time complexity by processing edges in ascending order of their lengths and using a union-find data structure to efficiently manage connected components, making it impossible to further reduce the time complexity without changing the algorithm's nature.
