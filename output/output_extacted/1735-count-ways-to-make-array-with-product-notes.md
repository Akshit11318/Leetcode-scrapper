## Count Ways to Make Array With Product
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-make-array-with-product/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `k`.
- Output: The number of ways to make an array with a product of `k`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: `k` can be any positive integer, and the array can have any length.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For `k = 1`, there is only one way to make an array with a product of `1`, which is an array containing only `1`.
    - For `k = 2`, there are two ways to make an array with a product of `2`, which are `[2]` and `[1, 2]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can generate all possible arrays of all lengths and calculate their product.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Start with an empty array.
    2. Generate all possible arrays by adding numbers from `1` to `k` to the array.
    3. For each array, calculate the product of its elements.
    4. If the product is equal to `k`, increment the count of ways.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible combinations.

```cpp
int countWaysToMakeArray(int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int len = 1; len <= k; len++) {
        vector<vector<int>> arrays;
        generateArrays(arrays, vector<int>(), 1, k, len);
        for (auto& array : arrays) {
            int product = 1;
            for (int num : array) {
                product *= num;
            }
            if (product == k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

void generateArrays(vector<vector<int>>& arrays, vector<int> current, int start, int k, int len) {
    if (current.size() == len) {
        arrays.push_back(current);
        return;
    }
    for (int i = start; i <= k; i++) {
        current.push_back(i);
        generateArrays(arrays, current, i, k, len);
        current.pop_back();
    }
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k^{k})$, because in the worst case, we are generating all possible arrays of length up to `k`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k^{k})$, because we are storing all generated arrays.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations, resulting in exponential time and space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to store the count of ways to make arrays with products up to `k`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Create a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the count of ways to make arrays with a product of `i`.
    2. Initialize `dp[1] = 1`, because there is only one way to make an array with a product of `1`.
    3. For each `i` from `2` to `k`, iterate over all `j` from `1` to `i` and update `dp[i] += dp[i / j]` if `i` is divisible by `j`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a polynomial time complexity and uses a minimal amount of space.

```cpp
int countWaysToMakeArray(int k) {
    vector<int> dp(k + 1, 0);
    dp[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= k; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            if (i % j == 0) {
                dp[i] += dp[i / j];
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[k];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k^2)$, because we are iterating over all numbers up to `k` and for each number, we are iterating up to `k`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, because we are using a dynamic programming table of size `k + 1`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach has a polynomial time complexity and uses a minimal amount of space, making it optimal.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, exponential time complexity.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using dynamic programming to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing time complexity from exponential to polynomial using dynamic programming.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve counting ways to make arrays with certain properties.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the dynamic programming table correctly, not handling edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: `k = 1`, `k = 2`, and other small values of `k`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach with exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with small and large values of `k`, and verifying that the output is correct.
