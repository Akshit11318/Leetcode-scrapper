## Number of Pairs of Strings with Concatenation Equal to Target

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-pairs-of-strings-with-concatenation-equal-to-target/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given an array of strings `nums` and a target string `target`.
- Constraints: All strings in `nums` and `target` consist of lowercase letters only.
- Expected output format: Return the number of pairs of strings in the `nums` array whose concatenation is equal to the `target` string.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - A pair of strings can be in any order (e.g., `a` and `b` or `b` and `a`).
  - The same string can be used in multiple pairs.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `nums = ["1","2","3"], target = "32"` Output: `1` Explanation: The only pair that can be concatenated to form the target string is `"3"` and `"2"`.
  - Input: `nums = ["777","7","77","77","7777","77777","777777"], target = "7777"` Output: `4` Explanation: There are four pairs that can be concatenated to form the target string: `"777"` and `"7"`, `"77"` and `"77"`, `"777"` and `"77"`, and `"7"` and `"7770"`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each string in the `nums` array, try concatenating it with every other string in the array and check if the result equals the `target` string.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each string in the `nums` array.
  2. For each string, iterate over every other string in the `nums` array.
  3. Concatenate the two strings and check if the result equals the `target` string.
  4. If it does, increment the count of pairs.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward and ensures that all possible pairs are considered.

```cpp
int numOfPairs(vector<string>& nums, string target) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (i != j && nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \times m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings in `nums` and $m$ is the maximum length of a string in `nums`. This is because for each pair of strings, we potentially concatenate and compare them, which takes $O(m)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input and output, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and indices.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we consider all pairs of strings and perform string concatenation and comparison for each pair. The space complexity is low because we do not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of checking every pair of strings, we can iterate over the `nums` array and for each string, check if the `target` string starts with it. If it does, the remaining part of the `target` string must also be in the `nums` array for it to be a valid pair.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a count of pairs to 0.
  2. Iterate over each string in the `nums` array.
  3. For each string, check if the `target` string starts with it.
  4. If it does, calculate the remaining part of the `target` string after removing the current string from the beginning.
  5. Check if the remaining part is also in the `nums` array. If it is, increment the count of pairs.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that we consider all possible pairs without unnecessary iterations, reducing the time complexity significantly.

```cpp
int numOfPairs(vector<string>& nums, string target) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& str : nums) {
        if (target.size() >= str.size() && target.substr(0, str.size()) == str) {
            string remaining = target.substr(str.size());
            for (const auto& other : nums) {
                if (other == remaining) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings in `nums` and $m$ is the maximum length of a string in `nums`. This is because for each string, we potentially iterate over the rest of the strings to find a match.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input and output, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and indices.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of string comparisons needed to find all pairs, leveraging the fact that we can start by matching the beginning of the target string.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, string manipulation, and pair counting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Reducing the problem space by leveraging the structure of the input data (in this case, the strings and their concatenation properties).
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary comparisons and leveraging string operations to reduce the time complexity.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring that the solution correctly handles cases where the target string cannot be formed by concatenating any two strings in the input array.
- Performance pitfalls: Failing to optimize the solution for large inputs, leading to high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with various input scenarios to ensure correctness and performance.
