## Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-sort-a-binary-tree-by-level/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A binary tree where each node has a unique value.
- Constraints: The binary tree is not guaranteed to be balanced or sorted.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations required to sort the binary tree by level.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - Each level of the tree should be sorted in ascending order after the operations.
  - An operation is defined as swapping two nodes at the same level.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: 
    - Input: 
        ```
        2
       / \
      3   1
     / \
    4   5
        ```
    - Output: 3
    - Explanation: We can sort the tree by swapping nodes at the same level: Swap 3 and 1, then swap 4 and 5.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves generating all possible permutations of nodes at each level and checking if the tree is sorted after each permutation.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree.
  2. At each level, generate all permutations of the nodes.
  3. For each permutation, check if the tree is sorted.
  4. If the tree is sorted, calculate the number of operations required to achieve this permutation.
  5. Keep track of the minimum number of operations required to sort the tree.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

int minOperations(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> levels;
    std::vector<TreeNode*> queue = {root};
    
    while (!queue.empty()) {
        std::vector<int> level;
        int size = queue.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            TreeNode* node = queue.front();
            queue.erase(queue.begin());
            level.push_back(node->val);
            
            if (node->left) queue.push_back(node->left);
            if (node->right) queue.push_back(node->right);
        }
        
        levels.push_back(level);
    }
    
    int operations = 0;
    
    for (auto& level : levels) {
        std::vector<int> sortedLevel = level;
        std::sort(sortedLevel.begin(), sortedLevel.end());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < level.size(); i++) {
            if (level[i] != sortedLevel[i]) operations++;
        }
    }
    
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot 2^n)$, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we generate all permutations of nodes at each level.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we store all levels of the binary tree.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all permutations of nodes at each level, which results in exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can calculate the minimum number of operations required to sort each level by counting the number of inversions in the level.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree.
  2. At each level, count the number of inversions in the level.
  3. The minimum number of operations required to sort the tree is the sum of the inversions at each level.

```cpp
int minOperations(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> levels;
    std::vector<TreeNode*> queue = {root};
    
    while (!queue.empty()) {
        std::vector<int> level;
        int size = queue.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            TreeNode* node = queue.front();
            queue.erase(queue.begin());
            level.push_back(node->val);
            
            if (node->left) queue.push_back(node->left);
            if (node->right) queue.push_back(node->right);
        }
        
        levels.push_back(level);
    }
    
    int operations = 0;
    
    for (auto& level : levels) {
        for (int i = 0; i < level.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < level.size(); j++) {
                if (level[i] > level[j]) operations++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we count the number of inversions at each level.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we store all levels of the binary tree.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we only need to count the number of inversions at each level to calculate the minimum number of operations required to sort the tree.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Level-order traversal, counting inversions.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a queue to perform level-order traversal.
- Optimization techniques learned: Counting inversions to calculate the minimum number of operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving level-order traversal and counting inversions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for null nodes, not handling edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty tree, tree with one node.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach, not optimizing the solution.
- Testing considerations: Test the solution with different inputs, including edge cases.
