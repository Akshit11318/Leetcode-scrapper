## Count Nodes That Are Great Enough

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-that-are-great-enough/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a tree with `n` nodes and `edges` representing the connections between nodes, and a threshold value `limit`.
- Each node `i` has a value `val[i]`.
- A node is considered great if it is greater than or equal to its neighbors' values and greater than or equal to the given threshold `limit`.
- The task is to count the number of great nodes in the tree.

**Input Format and Constraints:**
- `n`: The number of nodes in the tree.
- `edges`: A list of pairs representing the edges between nodes.
- `val`: A list of values for each node.
- `limit`: The threshold value.

**Expected Output Format:**
- The number of great nodes in the tree.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases to Consider:**
- Handling the case where a node has no neighbors (i.e., it's a leaf node).
- Ensuring the correct comparison with the threshold value.
- Counting nodes that meet the criteria for being great.

**Example Test Cases with Explanations:**
- Example 1:
  - Input: `n = 5`, `edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[3,4]]`, `val = [4,1,1,1,1]`, `limit = 0`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: All nodes are great because they are either greater than or equal to their neighbors and the threshold value.
- Example 2:
  - Input: `n = 5`, `edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[3,4]]`, `val = [5,1,3,1,1]`, `limit = 3`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Only nodes 0 and 2 are great because they meet the conditions.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking each node against its neighbors and the threshold value.
- For each node, compare its value with its neighbors' values and the threshold value.
- Count the nodes that meet the criteria for being great.

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> neighbors;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x) {}
};

int countGreatNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& val, int limit) {
    int count = 0;
    vector<bool> visited(val.size(), false);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < val.size(); i++) {
        if (!visited[i] && isGreatNode(root, i, edges, val, limit)) {
            count++;
            visited[i] = true;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

bool isGreatNode(TreeNode* root, int nodeIndex, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& val, int limit) {
    // Find the current node's neighbors
    vector<int> neighbors;
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        if (edge[0] == nodeIndex) neighbors.push_back(edge[1]);
        if (edge[1] == nodeIndex) neighbors.push_back(edge[0]);
    }
    
    // Compare the node's value with its neighbors and the threshold
    for (auto& neighbor : neighbors) {
        if (val[nodeIndex] < val[neighbor]) return false;
    }
    if (val[nodeIndex] < limit) return false;
    
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ because for each node, we potentially check all other nodes as neighbors.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the visited nodes and the neighbors of each node.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking each node against all potential neighbors and the threshold, leading to high time complexity. The space complexity comes from storing the visited nodes and neighbors.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to realize that we only need to compare a node's value with its immediate neighbors and the threshold value.
- We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the tree efficiently.
- For each node, check if its value is greater than or equal to all its neighbors' values and the threshold value.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> neighbors;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x) {}
};

int countGreatNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& val, int limit) {
    int count = 0;
    
    // Create an adjacency list representation of the tree
    vector<vector<int>> adjList(val.size());
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        adjList[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        adjList[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }
    
    // Perform DFS to count great nodes
    function<void(int)> dfs = [&](int node) {
        bool isGreat = true;
        for (auto& neighbor : adjList[node]) {
            if (val[node] < val[neighbor]) {
                isGreat = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (val[node] < limit) isGreat = false;
        
        if (isGreat) count++;
        
        for (auto& neighbor : adjList[node]) {
            dfs(neighbor);
        }
    };
    
    dfs(0); // Start DFS from the root node
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of edges, because we visit each node and edge once during the DFS traversal.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ for storing the adjacency list and the recursion stack.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only visits each node and edge once, minimizing the number of comparisons needed to count great nodes.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of understanding the problem constraints and requirements.
- Using graph traversal algorithms (DFS/BFS) to solve tree-related problems efficiently.
- Optimizing the solution by reducing unnecessary comparisons and visits.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Incorrectly assuming the structure of the tree or the relationships between nodes.
- Failing to handle edge cases, such as nodes with no neighbors.
- Not optimizing the solution for large inputs, leading to performance issues.

By following this approach, you can efficiently solve the problem and count the great nodes in the tree.
