## Find the Count of Numbers Which Are Not Special

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-count-of-numbers-which-are-not-special/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two integers `n` and `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`.
- Expected Output: The count of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) that are not special.
- Key Requirements: A number `x` is special if there exists a number `y` such that `x` is divisible by `y` and `y` is divisible by `x`, or if `x` is equal to `k`.
- Edge Cases: Numbers that are not divisible by any number other than 1 and themselves (prime numbers) are not special.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check each number from 1 to `n` to see if it's special by testing divisibility with all numbers up to itself.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each number `x` from 1 to `n`.
  2. For each `x`, check if it's divisible by any number `y` (where `y` ranges from 2 to `x`).
  3. If `x` is divisible by `y`, and `y` is also divisible by `x`, then `x` is special.
  4. Additionally, if `x` equals `k`, then `x` is special.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the definition of a special number by checking all possible conditions for each number in the range.

```cpp
int countNumbers(int n, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; ++x) {
        bool isSpecial = false;
        for (int y = 1; y <= x; ++y) {
            if (x % y == 0 && y % x == 0) {
                isSpecial = true;
                break;
            }
            if (x == k) {
                isSpecial = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!isSpecial) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, because for each of the `n` numbers, we potentially iterate up to `n` times to check divisibility.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The nested loop structure leads to the quadratic time complexity, while the constant space usage is due to only using a fixed amount of space regardless of input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Recognize that a number `x` is special if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself (making it not prime) or if it equals `k`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a helper function to check if a number is prime.
  2. Iterate over each number from 1 to `n`.
  3. For each number, check if it's prime using the helper function. If it's not prime or if it equals `k`, it's special.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it reduces the time complexity significantly by only checking divisibility up to the square root of `x` when determining if `x` is prime, leveraging the fact that a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.

```cpp
bool isPrime(int x) {
    if (x <= 1) return false;
    if (x == 2) return true;
    if (x % 2 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 3; i * i <= x; i += 2) {
        if (x % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int countNumbers(int n, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; ++x) {
        if (isPrime(x) && x != k) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \sqrt{n})$, because for each number up to `n`, we potentially check divisibility up to its square root.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the best possible complexity for this problem under the given constraints because we must check each number at least once, and the prime check is optimized to only go up to the square root of the number.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Prime number checks, optimization of brute force approaches.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Reducing complexity by leveraging mathematical properties (e.g., prime numbers).
- Optimization techniques learned: Using helper functions for repeated operations, reducing iteration ranges.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving prime numbers, divisibility, and optimization.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases (e.g., `n` equals 1), incorrect loop ranges.
- Edge cases to watch for: Numbers less than or equal to 1, numbers equal to `k`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using overly broad iteration ranges, not optimizing repeated operations.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various values of `n` and `k`, including edge cases.
