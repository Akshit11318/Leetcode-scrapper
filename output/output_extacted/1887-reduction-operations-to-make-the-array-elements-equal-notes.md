## Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reduction-operations-to-make-the-array-elements-equal/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an array of integers as input and requires finding the minimum number of operations to make all elements in the array equal.
- Expected output format: The output should be the minimum number of operations required.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array can contain duplicate elements, and the goal is to find the most frequent element and calculate the minimum operations to transform all elements to this most frequent element.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `nums = [5,1,3]`
  - Output: `3`
  - Explanation: Transform 5 to 3 in one operation, and 1 to 3 in two operations.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to try all possible elements in the array as the target element and calculate the number of operations required to transform all other elements to this target.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each unique element in the array.
  2. For each unique element, calculate the number of operations required to transform all other elements to this element.
  3. Keep track of the minimum number of operations found across all unique elements.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that considers all possibilities but is inefficient due to its high time complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reductionOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> count;
        for (int num : nums) {
            count[num]++;
        }
        
        int minOperations = INT_MAX;
        for (auto& pair : count) {
            int operations = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num != pair.first) {
                    operations += abs(num - pair.first);
                }
            }
            minOperations = min(minOperations, operations);
        }
        
        return minOperations;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because for each unique element, we potentially iterate through the entire array again.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the count of each unique element.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested iterations, leading to a high time complexity. The space complexity is due to the map used to store the count of unique elements.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of trying all elements as the target, we can directly find the most frequent element and calculate the operations required to transform all other elements to this most frequent element.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Count the frequency of each element in the array.
  2. Find the most frequent element.
  3. Calculate the number of operations required to transform all elements to the most frequent element.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly identifies the most efficient target element (the most frequent one) and calculates the minimum operations required to make all elements equal to this target.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a linear time complexity and is the most efficient way to solve the problem given the constraints.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reductionOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> count;
        for (int num : nums) {
            count[num]++;
        }
        
        int maxCount = 0;
        for (auto& pair : count) {
            maxCount = max(maxCount, pair.second);
        }
        
        int operations = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count[num] == maxCount) continue;
            operations += abs(num - num); // This line is just a placeholder, actual calculation depends on the specific problem constraints
            // For this problem, we can simply count the number of elements that are not the most frequent
            operations += 1;
        }
        
        // However, the above approach does not accurately calculate the number of operations as per the problem statement.
        // A more accurate approach involves understanding that the number of operations is the sum of the indices of the non-majority elements in their sorted order.
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int majority = nums[nums.size() / 2];
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] != majority) {
                result += i;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

However, the optimal solution can be simplified by understanding the nature of the problem. The number of operations required to make all elements equal is actually the sum of the indices of the elements in their sorted order, excluding the most frequent element.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reductionOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int result = 0;
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                index++;
            }
            if (nums[i] != nums[0]) {
                result += index;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to sorting, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ if we consider the sorting as in-place, or $O(n)$ if we consider the space required for sorting.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to the most frequent element, leveraging the properties of sorting.
