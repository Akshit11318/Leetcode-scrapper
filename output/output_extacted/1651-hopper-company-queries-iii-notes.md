## Hopper Company Queries III

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/hopper-company-queries-iii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D array `rides` representing different ride options with their start and end times, and an integer `k` representing the number of queries.
- Constraints: $1 \leq k \leq 10^5$ and $1 \leq rides.length \leq 10^5$, where each ride is an array of three integers: start time, end time, and profit.
- Expected output format: An array of integers representing the maximum profit that can be obtained for each query.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - Each query corresponds to a specific ride.
    - A ride can only be taken once.
    - The profit of a ride is only added to the total profit if the ride is taken.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - `rides = [[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]]`, `k = 3`, the output should be `[3,4,5]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each query, calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained by considering all possible rides and their corresponding profits.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize an array to store the maximum profit for each query.
    2. Iterate over each query and calculate the maximum profit by considering all possible rides.
    3. For each ride, check if it can be taken (i.e., its start time is greater than or equal to the end time of the previous ride).
    4. If a ride can be taken, add its profit to the total profit.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and considers all possible scenarios, making it a natural first thought.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> maxProfit(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& rides, int k) {
        std::vector<int> max_profits(k);
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int max_profit = 0;
            for (const auto& ride : rides) {
                if (ride[0] >= i) {
                    max_profit = std::max(max_profit, ride[2]);
                }
            }
            max_profits[i] = max_profit;
        }
        return max_profits;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of rides. This is because for each query, we iterate over all rides.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, where $k$ is the number of queries. This is because we store the maximum profit for each query.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we consider all possible rides for each query, and the space complexity is moderate because we store the maximum profit for each query.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of considering all rides for each query, we can use a more efficient data structure, such as a binary search tree or a priority queue, to store the rides and their corresponding profits.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Sort the rides based on their end times.
    2. Initialize a priority queue to store the rides that can be taken.
    3. Iterate over each query and update the priority queue accordingly.
    4. For each query, the maximum profit is the maximum profit of the rides in the priority queue.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible rides that can be taken for each query and uses a efficient data structure to store and retrieve the rides.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> maxProfit(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& rides, int k) {
        std::sort(rides.begin(), rides.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        std::priority_queue<int> pq;
        std::vector<int> max_profits(k);
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            while (!rides.empty() && rides[0][1] <= i) {
                pq.push(rides[0][2]);
                rides.erase(rides.begin());
            }
            if (!pq.empty()) {
                max_profits[i] = pq.top();
                pq.pop();
            }
        }
        return max_profits;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + k \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of rides. This is because we sort the rides and use a priority queue.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rides. This is because we store the rides in the priority queue.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a efficient data structure to store and retrieve the rides, and it considers all possible rides that can be taken for each query.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: sorting, priority queues, and efficient data structures.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using efficient data structures to reduce time complexity.
- Optimization techniques learned: using priority queues to store and retrieve rides.
- Similar problems to practice: problems involving efficient data structures and optimization techniques.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not handling edge cases, such as empty input or invalid input.
- Edge cases to watch for: rides with invalid start or end times, or rides with zero profit.
- Performance pitfalls: using inefficient data structures or algorithms, such as brute force approaches.
- Testing considerations: testing with different input sizes and edge cases to ensure correctness and efficiency.
