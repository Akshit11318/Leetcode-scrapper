## String Transformation
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/string-transformation/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a string `s`, a dictionary `dictionary` containing a list of strings, and a string `target`, determine if it's possible to transform `s` into `target` by changing one character at a time, where each intermediate string is in `dictionary`.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if `s` can be transformed into `target`, `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The length of `s`, `target`, and all strings in `dictionary` are the same.
  - All characters in `s`, `target`, and all strings in `dictionary` are lowercase English letters.
  - `s` is not equal to `target`.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - For `s = "abc"`, `target = "bcd"`, and `dictionary = ["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"]`, the function should return `true` because `abc` can be transformed into `bcd` by changing one character at a time, with each intermediate string in `dictionary`.
  - For `s = "abc"`, `target = "bca"`, and `dictionary = ["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"]`, the function should return `false` because there's no sequence of transformations from `abc` to `bca` using strings from `dictionary`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible transformations of `s` into `target` by changing one character at a time and check if each intermediate string is in `dictionary`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start with `s`.
  2. Generate all possible strings by changing one character at a time.
  3. Check if each generated string is in `dictionary`.
  4. If a string is in `dictionary`, repeat steps 2-3 with this new string until `target` is reached or no more transformations are possible.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive search that guarantees finding a transformation if one exists.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

bool stringTransformation(string s, vector<string>& dictionary, string target) {
    unordered_set<string> dictSet(dictionary.begin(), dictionary.end());
    vector<string> queue;
    queue.push_back(s);
    unordered_set<string> visited;
    visited.insert(s);
    
    while (!queue.empty()) {
        string current = queue.front();
        queue.erase(queue.begin());
        
        if (current == target) return true;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < current.size(); i++) {
            for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
                string next = current;
                next[i] = c;
                
                if (dictSet.count(next) && visited.find(next) == visited.end()) {
                    queue.push_back(next);
                    visited.insert(next);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N \cdot M \cdot 26)$, where $N$ is the length of `s` (and `target`), $M$ is the number of strings in `dictionary`, and $26$ is the number of lowercase English letters. This is because in the worst case, for each string in the queue, we generate $N \cdot 26$ new strings and check if they are in `dictionary`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(M + N \cdot M)$, for storing the `dictionary` as a set and the queue and visited set.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high due to the generation of all possible transformations and checking them against `dictionary`. The space complexity is due to storing all the necessary data structures.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to efficiently explore all possible transformations. This is more efficient than the brute force approach because it avoids redundant explorations by using a queue and marking visited states.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a queue with the starting string `s` and mark it as visited.
  2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a string and generate all its possible transformations by changing one character at a time.
  3. For each transformation, check if it is in `dictionary` and has not been visited before. If so, mark it as visited and enqueue it.
  4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the queue is empty or `target` is found.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it explores all possible transformations in the shortest number of steps (i.e., it uses the minimum number of operations to find a transformation or determines that no transformation exists).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

bool stringTransformation(string s, vector<string>& dictionary, string target) {
    unordered_set<string> dictSet(dictionary.begin(), dictionary.end());
    queue<string> q;
    q.push(s);
    unordered_set<string> visited;
    visited.insert(s);
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        string current = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        if (current == target) return true;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < current.size(); i++) {
            for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
                string next = current;
                next[i] = c;
                
                if (dictSet.count(next) && visited.find(next) == visited.end()) {
                    q.push(next);
                    visited.insert(next);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: BFS, string manipulation, and efficient exploration of state spaces.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using BFS to solve problems that involve exploring a large state space efficiently.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding redundant explorations by marking visited states.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string transformation problems, graph traversal problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not marking visited states, not checking for the existence of a string in `dictionary` before exploring its transformations.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where `s` is equal to `target`, handling the case where `dictionary` is empty.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient data structure to store `dictionary`, not using BFS to explore the state space efficiently.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it works correctly.
