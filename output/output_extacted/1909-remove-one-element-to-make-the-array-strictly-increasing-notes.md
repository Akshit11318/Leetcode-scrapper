## Remove One Element to Make the Array Strictly Increasing

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-one-element-to-make-the-array-strictly-increasing/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums`.
- Constraints: The array will have at least 2 elements and at most 10^5 elements. Each element will be an integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
- Expected output: Return `true` if it is possible to remove at most one element to make the array strictly increasing, otherwise return `false`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling arrays with duplicate elements, arrays that are already strictly increasing, and arrays where removing one element can make them strictly increasing.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `nums = [10,5,2,5,10]`, Output: `false`
  - Input: `nums = [5,1,5,5,5]`, Output: `false`
  - Input: `nums = [1,2,10,5,7]`, Output: `false`
  - Input: `nums = [1,1]`, Output: `false`
  - Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`, Output: `true`
  - Input: `nums = [1,2,1]`, Output: `true`
  - Input: `nums = [2,3,1,4]`, Output: `true`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible array that can be formed by removing one element from the given array.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate over the array and for each element, create a new array by removing the current element.
  2. Check if the new array is strictly increasing.
  3. If any of the new arrays are strictly increasing, return `true`.
  4. If none of the new arrays are strictly increasing, return `false`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeIncreasing(vector<int>& nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            vector<int> temp = nums;
            temp.erase(temp.begin() + i);
            if (isStrictlyIncreasing(temp)) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    bool isStrictlyIncreasing(vector<int>& nums) {
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. The outer loop runs $n$ times, and for each iteration, we create a new array and check if it's strictly increasing, which takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we create a new array of size $n-1$ in each iteration of the outer loop.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking every possible array that can be formed by removing one element, resulting in quadratic time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the creation of a new array in each iteration.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of checking every possible array, we can iterate over the array once and keep track of the number of elements that need to be removed to make the array strictly increasing.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a variable `removed` to 0, which keeps track of the number of elements that need to be removed.
  2. Iterate over the array, and for each element, check if it's less than or equal to the previous element.
  3. If the current element is less than or equal to the previous element, increment `removed`.
  4. If `removed` becomes greater than 1, return `false`.
  5. If the loop completes and `removed` is 0 or 1, return `true`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeIncreasing(vector<int>& nums) {
        int removed = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
                removed++;
                if (removed > 1) return false;
                // Check if removing the current or previous element makes the array strictly increasing
                if (i > 1 && nums[i] <= nums[i - 2] && i < nums.size() - 1 && nums[i - 1] >= nums[i + 1]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. We only iterate over the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `removed` variable.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the array, and it correctly handles all possible cases where removing one element can make the array strictly increasing.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional statements, and optimization techniques.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking every possible array, and then optimizing the approach by iterating over the array once.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by iterating over the array once.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases, such as arrays with duplicate elements or arrays that are already strictly increasing.
- Edge cases to watch for: Arrays with duplicate elements, arrays that are already strictly increasing, and arrays where removing one element can make them strictly increasing.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that results in quadratic time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input arrays, including edge cases and arrays with varying sizes.
