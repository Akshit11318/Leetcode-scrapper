## Check If It Is a Good Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-it-is-a-good-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.
- Expected output format: A boolean indicating whether the array is good.
- Key requirements: A good array is defined as an array where the greatest common divisor of all the numbers in the array is greater than 1.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `nums = [12,15,24]`, Output: `true`, Explanation: The greatest common divisor of 12, 15, and 24 is 3.
  - Input: `nums = [4,6,8]`, Output: `true`, Explanation: The greatest common divisor of 4, 6, and 8 is 2.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all numbers in the array, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers and then apply it to all pairs of numbers in the array.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Define a helper function to calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
  2. Initialize the GCD with the first element of the array.
  3. Iterate through the rest of the array, updating the GCD by calculating the GCD of the current GCD and the current number.
  4. After iterating through all numbers, check if the final GCD is greater than 1.

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isGoodArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Helper function to calculate GCD using Euclidean algorithm
        int gcd(int a, int b) {
            if (b == 0) return a;
            return gcd(b, a % b);
        }

        // Initialize GCD with the first element
        int g = nums[0];

        // Iterate through the rest of the array to find the GCD of all numbers
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            g = gcd(g, nums[i]);
        }

        // Check if the GCD is greater than 1
        return g > 1;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log m)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array and $m$ is the maximum value in the array. This is because for each element, we are potentially calculating the GCD which takes $\log m$ time in the worst case using the Euclidean algorithm.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input array, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the GCD.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the GCD calculations for each pair of numbers, and the space complexity is constant because we only store a single variable to keep track of the GCD.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The provided brute force approach is already optimal for this problem because it uses the most efficient method (Euclidean algorithm) to calculate the GCD and applies it to all elements in the array in a single pass.
- No further optimization is possible without changing the fundamental approach to calculating the GCD of all elements in an array.

```cpp
// The code provided in the brute force section is already optimal.
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log m)$, where $n$ is the number of elements and $m$ is the maximum value in the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the input array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the best possible time complexity because we must at least read the input array once (which takes $O(n)$ time) and for each element, we must perform some operation to determine if it contributes to a GCD greater than 1. The Euclidean algorithm is the most efficient method for calculating the GCD of two numbers, and applying it iteratively to all numbers in the array is the most straightforward approach.
