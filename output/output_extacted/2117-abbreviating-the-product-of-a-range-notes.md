## Abbreviating the Product of a Range
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/abbreviating-the-product-of-a-range/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given an integer `left` and an integer `right`, representing a range of integers from `left` to `right` (inclusive).
- Constraints: `1 <= left <= right <= 10^6`
- Expected output format: A string representing the abbreviated product of all numbers in the range.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The product of all numbers in the range might be very large, so it needs to be abbreviated to fit within the limits of a string.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `left = 1` and `right = 4`, the product is `1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`, which can be abbreviated as `"24"`.
  - For `left = 2` and `right = 7`, the product is `2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 = 5040`, which can be abbreviated as `"2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7"`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the product of all numbers in the range and then try to abbreviate it by factoring out prime numbers.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Calculate the product of all numbers in the range.
  2. Find the prime factorization of the product.
  3. Abbreviate the product by representing each prime factor as `prime^exponent`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by calculating the product and then attempting to abbreviate it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool isPrime(int num) {
    if (num < 2) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(num); i++) {
        if (num % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Function to find prime factors and their exponents
std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> primeFactors(int num) {
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> factors;
    for (int i = 2; i <= num; i++) {
        if (isPrime(i)) {
            int count = 0;
            while (num % i == 0) {
                num /= i;
                count++;
            }
            if (count > 0) factors.push_back({i, count});
        }
    }
    return factors;
}

// Brute force approach to abbreviate the product of a range
std::string abbreviateProduct(int left, int right) {
    long long product = 1;
    for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        product *= i;
    }
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> factors = primeFactors(product);
    std::string abbreviated;
    for (const auto& factor : factors) {
        if (factor.second > 1) {
            abbreviated += std::to_string(factor.first) + "^" + std::to_string(factor.second) + " * ";
        } else {
            abbreviated += std::to_string(factor.first) + " * ";
        }
    }
    // Remove the trailing " * "
    if (!abbreviated.empty()) {
        abbreviated.pop_back();
        abbreviated.pop_back();
    }
    return abbreviated;
}

int main() {
    int left = 2, right = 7;
    std::cout << abbreviateProduct(left, right) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the product of the range, due to the prime factorization step.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(\sqrt{n})$ for storing the prime factors.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves calculating the product of all numbers in the range and then finding its prime factorization, which leads to high time and space complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of calculating the product of all numbers and then finding its prime factorization, we can directly calculate the prime factorization of each number in the range and sum up the exponents.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate through each number in the range.
  2. For each number, find its prime factorization and add the exponents to a running total for each prime.
  3. Abbreviate the product by representing each prime factor as `prime^exponent`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach avoids the need to calculate the product of the entire range, reducing the time and space complexities significantly.

```cpp
// Optimal approach to abbreviate the product of a range
std::string abbreviateProductOptimal(int left, int right) {
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> primeFactors;
    for (int num = left; num <= right; num++) {
        for (int i = 2; i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                bool found = false;
                for (auto& factor : primeFactors) {
                    if (factor.first == i) {
                        factor.second++;
                        found = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!found) {
                    primeFactors.push_back({i, 1});
                }
                while (num % i == 0) {
                    num /= i;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    std::string abbreviated;
    for (const auto& factor : primeFactors) {
        if (factor.second > 1) {
            abbreviated += std::to_string(factor.first) + "^" + std::to_string(factor.second) + " * ";
        } else {
            abbreviated += std::to_string(factor.first) + " * ";
        }
    }
    // Remove the trailing " * "
    if (!abbreviated.empty()) {
        abbreviated.pop_back();
        abbreviated.pop_back();
    }
    return abbreviated;
}

int main() {
    int left = 2, right = 7;
    std::cout << abbreviateProductOptimal(left, right) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
