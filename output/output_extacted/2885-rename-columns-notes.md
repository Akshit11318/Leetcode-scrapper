## Rename Columns

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/rename-columns/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D array representing a table with column names and rows of data.
- Constraints: The number of columns in the table is between 1 and 26 (inclusive).
- Expected output format: The modified table with column names renamed according to the given rules.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The new column names should be in the format "columnX" where X is the column index + 1, and the original data in the table should remain unchanged.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Test case 1: 
    - Input: `table = [["a","b","c"],["d","e","f"]]`
    - Expected output: `[["column1","column2","column3"],["d","e","f"]]`
  - Test case 2:
    - Input: `table = [["aa","bb","cc"],["dd","ee","ff"]]`
    - Expected output: `[["column1","column2","column3"],["dd","ee","ff"]]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can simply replace the first row of the table with the new column names.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a new array to store the new column names.
  2. Iterate over the columns in the table and generate the new column name for each column.
  3. Replace the first row of the table with the new column names.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive solution that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
vector<vector<string>> renameColumns(vector<vector<string>>& table) {
    int columns = table[0].size();
    vector<string> newColumnNames;
    
    // Generate new column names
    for (int i = 0; i < columns; i++) {
        string columnName = "column" + to_string(i + 1);
        newColumnNames.push_back(columnName);
    }
    
    // Replace the first row with new column names
    table[0] = newColumnNames;
    
    return table;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of columns in the table, since we are iterating over the columns once to generate the new column names.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, since we are storing the new column names in a separate array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are performing a constant amount of work for each column, and the space complexity is also linear because we are storing the new column names in a separate array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved in a single pass by directly modifying the first row of the table.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate over the columns in the table.
  2. For each column, generate the new column name and replace the corresponding element in the first row of the table.
- Proof of optimality: This solution has the same time complexity as the brute force approach but uses less space because it does not require a separate array to store the new column names.

```cpp
vector<vector<string>> renameColumns(vector<vector<string>>& table) {
    int columns = table[0].size();
    
    // Generate new column names and replace the first row
    for (int i = 0; i < columns; i++) {
        table[0][i] = "column" + to_string(i + 1);
    }
    
    return table;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of columns in the table.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we are modifying the table in-place and not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we are performing the minimum amount of work necessary to solve the problem, and we are not using any unnecessary space.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: In-place modification, iteration over a data structure.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Directly addressing the problem statement, optimizing space usage.
- Optimization techniques learned: In-place modification, reducing unnecessary space usage.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve modifying a data structure in-place.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking the input size, not handling edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: An empty table, a table with a single row.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary space, performing unnecessary work.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input sizes, test the function with edge cases.
