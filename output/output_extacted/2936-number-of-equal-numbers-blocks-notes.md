## Number of Equal Number Blocks

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-equal-numbers-blocks/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Output: The number of blocks of size `k` that contain all equal numbers.
- Key requirements: The array `nums` can contain any integer, and `k` is a positive integer.
- Edge cases: When `k` is larger than the length of `nums`, or when `nums` is empty.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2], k = 2` should return `4`.
- `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], k = 3` should return `3`.
- `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 5` should return `1`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate over the array `nums` in blocks of size `k`.
- For each block, check if all elements are equal.
- If they are, increment the count of equal blocks.

```cpp
int countEqualBlocks(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= nums.size() - k; i++) {
        bool isBlockEqual = true;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < i + k; j++) {
            if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
                isBlockEqual = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isBlockEqual) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. This is because for each block of size `k`, we are potentially checking all `k` elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the count and indices.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inefficient because it checks every block of size `k` individually, leading to a high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to realize that we can use a single pass through the array to count the equal blocks.
- We can use a `set` to store the unique elements in each block and check if the size of the set is 1 (indicating all elements are equal).

```cpp
int countEqualBlocks(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= nums.size() - k; i++) {
        set<int> uniqueElements;
        for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
            uniqueElements.insert(nums[j]);
        }
        if (uniqueElements.size() == 1) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

However, we can further optimize this by using a single loop and avoiding the use of `set` for each block. We can directly compare elements in the block.

```cpp
int countEqualBlocks(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= nums.size() - k; i++) {
        bool isBlockEqual = true;
        for (int j = 1; j < k; j++) {
            if (nums[i + j] != nums[i]) {
                isBlockEqual = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isBlockEqual) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. This is still the same as the brute force because we are checking each block of size `k`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the count and indices.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we must check each block of size `k` at least once to determine if it contains all equal numbers.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: block comparison, single pass through the array.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using a single loop to iterate over the array, comparing elements within each block.
- Optimization techniques learned: avoiding unnecessary data structures like `set`, directly comparing elements.
- Similar problems to practice: other problems involving block comparison or single pass through an array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: using `set` unnecessarily, not handling edge cases properly.
- Edge cases to watch for: when `k` is larger than the length of `nums`, or when `nums` is empty.
- Performance pitfalls: using inefficient data structures or algorithms.
- Testing considerations: testing with different sizes of `nums` and `k`, testing with different types of input (e.g., all equal elements, all different elements).
