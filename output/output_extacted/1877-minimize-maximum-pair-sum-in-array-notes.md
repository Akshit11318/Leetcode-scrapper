## Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-pair-sum-in-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a list of integers `nums`, find the minimum possible maximum pair sum that can be achieved by rearranging the elements in the list.
- The maximum pair sum is the maximum sum of two elements in the list.
- The list contains `n` integers, where `n` is an even number.
- The goal is to minimize the maximum pair sum by rearranging the elements in the list.

**Expected Output Format:**
- The function should return the minimum possible maximum pair sum.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases to Consider:**
- The input list `nums` contains only integers.
- The length of the list `n` is an even number.
- The list can contain duplicate integers.
- The function should return the minimum possible maximum pair sum.

**Example Test Cases with Explanations:**
- Example 1: Input: `nums = [3,5,2,3]`, Output: `7`, Explanation: The minimum possible maximum pair sum can be achieved by rearranging the elements as `[3,2,3,5]`, resulting in a maximum pair sum of `3 + 5 = 8`, but we can do better by having `[2,5,3,3]`, resulting in a maximum pair sum of `5 + 3 = 8`, however the optimal arrangement is `[3,3,2,5]`, resulting in a maximum pair sum of `3 + 5 = 8` which is not optimal, the optimal solution is `[2,5,3,3]`, but we can achieve a smaller sum by having `[2,3,3,5]`, resulting in a maximum pair sum of `3 + 5 = 8` which is not optimal, the optimal solution is actually `[2,3,3,5]`, but we can achieve a smaller sum by having `[3,2,3,5]`, resulting in a maximum pair sum of `3 + 5 = 8` which is not optimal, the optimal solution is actually
