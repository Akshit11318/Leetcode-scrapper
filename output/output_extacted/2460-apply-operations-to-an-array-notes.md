## Apply Operations to an Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-an-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer `index` where `1 <= index <= n`, apply the following operations to `nums`:
    - If `nums[index - 1]` is even, divide it by 2.
    - If `nums[index - 1]` is odd, multiply it by 2.
- Expected output format: Return the modified array after applying the operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
    - `1 <= n <= 50`
    - `1 <= index <= n`
    - `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - Example 1: `nums = [1,2,4,6]`, `index = 2`
        - `nums[1]` is even, so we divide it by 2 to get `nums = [1,1,4,6]`.
    - Example 2: `nums = [3,2,2,4]`, `index = 3`
        - `nums[2]` is even, so we divide it by 2 to get `nums = [3,2,1,4]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The problem seems straightforward. We just need to check the value at the given index and apply the corresponding operation.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Check if the value at `nums[index - 1]` is even or odd.
    2. If it's even, divide it by 2.
    3. If it's odd, multiply it by 2.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement without requiring additional insights.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> applyOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int index) {
    // Check if the value at nums[index - 1] is even or odd
    if (nums[index - 1] % 2 == 0) {
        // If it's even, divide it by 2
        nums[index - 1] /= 2;
    } else {
        // If it's odd, multiply it by 2
        nums[index - 1] *= 2;
    }
    return nums;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we're only performing a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we're not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The operations are independent of the input size, so the time and space complexities are constant.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem doesn't require any additional insights beyond the brute force approach. The operations are simple and don't have any dependencies that could be optimized further.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach is the same as the brute force approach, since we're already performing the minimum number of operations required to solve the problem.
- Proof of optimality: The problem requires us to perform a single operation based on the value at a specific index. We can't reduce the number of operations further, so the optimal approach is already achieved.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The problem is too simple, and the operations are independent of the input size, so there's no room for further optimization.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> applyOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int index) {
    // Check if the value at nums[index - 1] is even or odd
    if (nums[index - 1] % 2 == 0) {
        // If it's even, divide it by 2
        nums[index - 1] /= 2;
    } else {
        // If it's odd, multiply it by 2
        nums[index - 1] *= 2;
    }
    return nums;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Simple conditional statements and basic arithmetic operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Directly addressing the problem statement without requiring additional insights.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, since the problem is too simple and already optimized.
- Similar problems to practice: Other simple problems that require basic arithmetic operations and conditional statements.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to check for even or odd values, or using incorrect operators for division and multiplication.
- Edge cases to watch for: None, since the problem doesn't have any edge cases that require special handling.
- Performance pitfalls: None, since the problem is too simple and doesn't have any performance-critical components.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input values, including even and odd numbers, to ensure it works correctly in all cases.
