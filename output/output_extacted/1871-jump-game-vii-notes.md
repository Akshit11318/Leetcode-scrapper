## Jump Game VII
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-vii/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-vii/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given an array `nums` and integers `start` and `end`.
- Constraints: `0 <= start < end < nums.length`.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if we can reach the index `end` from index `start`, otherwise return `false`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Array can contain both positive and negative integers.
  - `start` and `end` indices are within the bounds of the array.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = [1,1,1,1,1], start = 0, end = 4`, the output should be `true` because we can jump from index `0` to `4` in one step.
  - For `nums = [0,0,0,0,0], start = 0, end = 4`, the output should be `false` because we cannot move from index `0` to `4`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible jumps from the `start` index until we reach the `end` index or we cannot make any more jumps.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start at the `start` index.
  2. Try all possible jumps from the current index.
  3. If we reach the `end` index, return `true`.
  4. If we cannot make any more jumps, return `false`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to solve the problem by trying all possible jumps.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canReach(vector<int>& nums, int start) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        return dfs(nums, start, visited);
    }
    
    bool dfs(vector<int>& nums, int i, vector<bool>& visited) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= nums.size() || visited[i]) return false;
        if (nums[i] == 0) return true;
        visited[i] = true;
        return dfs(nums, i + nums[i], visited) || dfs(nums, i - nums[i], visited);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$ in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we try all possible jumps from each index.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for the recursion stack and the `visited` array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is exponential because we try all possible jumps from each index, and the space complexity is linear because we need to keep track of the visited indices.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) to try all possible jumps from the `start` index.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Start at the `start` index.
  2. Try all possible jumps from the current index.
  3. If we reach the `end` index, return `true`.
  4. If we cannot make any more jumps, return `false`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it tries all possible jumps from the `start` index in a systematic way.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canReach(vector<int>& nums, int start) {
        int n = nums.size();
        queue<int> q;
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        q.push(start);
        visited[start] = true;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int i = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (i == 0) return true;
            if (i + nums[i] < n && !visited[i + nums[i]]) {
                q.push(i + nums[i]);
                visited[i + nums[i]] = true;
            }
            if (i - nums[i] >= 0 && !visited[i - nums[i]]) {
                q.push(i - nums[i]);
                visited[i - nums[i]] = true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: BFS, DFS, and recursion.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Trying all possible jumps from the `start` index.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a queue to avoid revisiting the same indices.
- Similar problems to practice: Jump Game, Jump Game II, and Jump Game III.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking the bounds of the array, not handling the case where the `start` index is the same as the `end` index.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where the `start` index is the same as the `end` index, the case where the array contains only zeros.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a recursive approach without memoization, not using a queue to avoid revisiting the same indices.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases and corner cases.
