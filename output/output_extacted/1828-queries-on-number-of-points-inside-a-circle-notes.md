## Queries on Number of Points Inside a Circle

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-on-number-of-points-inside-a-circle/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input consists of two arrays: `points` and `queries`. `points` is an array of pairs representing points in a 2D space, and `queries` is an array of triples representing circles defined by a center point and a radius. The task is to count the number of points inside each query circle.
- Expected output format: The function should return an array of integers where the i-th integer represents the number of points inside the i-th query circle.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - A point is considered inside a circle if its distance from the center of the circle is strictly less than the radius of the circle.
  - The input arrays can be empty, and the function should handle this case correctly.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: points = [[1,3],[3,5],[5,7],[2,2]], queries = [[2,3,1],[4,6,2]]. The function should return [2,3] because there are 2 points inside the first query circle and 3 points inside the second query circle.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating over each query and for each query, iterating over all points to calculate the distance from the point to the center of the query circle.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each query circle.
  2. For each query circle, iterate over all points.
  3. Calculate the distance from the current point to the center of the current query circle.
  4. If the distance is less than the radius of the query circle, increment the count of points inside the query circle.
  5. After checking all points for the current query circle, add the count of points inside the query circle to the result array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly follows from the problem statement.

```cpp
vector<int> countPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int count = 0;
        for (auto& point : points) {
            int dx = point[0] - query[0];
            int dy = point[1] - query[1];
            int distance = dx * dx + dy * dy;
            if (distance < query[2] * query[2]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        result.push_back(count);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the number of queries and $m$ is the number of points. This is because for each query, we iterate over all points.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the result array, where $n$ is the number of queries.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because of the nested iteration over queries and points. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the count of points for each query.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal for this problem because we must check each point against each query circle to determine if it's inside. However, we can slightly optimize the calculation of the distance by avoiding the square root operation, as we only need to compare the squared distance with the squared radius.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate over each query circle.
  2. For each query circle, iterate over all points.
  3. Calculate the squared distance from the current point to the center of the current query circle.
  4. If the squared distance is less than the squared radius of the query circle, increment the count of points inside the query circle.
  5. After checking all points for the current query circle, add the count of points inside the query circle to the result array.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has the same time complexity as the brute force approach but with a slight optimization in the distance calculation.

```cpp
vector<int> countPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int count = 0;
        for (auto& point : points) {
            int dx = point[0] - query[0];
            int dy = point[1] - query[1];
            int distanceSquared = dx * dx + dy * dy;
            if (distanceSquared < query[2] * query[2]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        result.push_back(count);
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional checks, and distance calculation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The need to check each element against every other element in a different array.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary calculations (like square root) when possible.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving geometric calculations or comparisons between elements of different arrays.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating distances or comparing them incorrectly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input arrays or queries with zero radius.
- Performance pitfalls: Unnecessary calculations or iterations.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with different input sizes, edge cases, and query configurations.
