## Minimum Operations to Make a Special Number
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-special-number/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `num` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= num <= 10^9`, `1 <= k <= 10^6`.
- Expected Output: The minimum number of operations to make `num` a special number, where a special number is defined as a number that can be divided by `k` without leaving a remainder.
- Key Requirements:
  - Find the minimum number of operations to make `num` a special number.
  - An operation is defined as either adding or subtracting 1 from `num`.
- Edge Cases:
  - If `num` is already a special number, return 0.
  - If `num` is 0, return 0.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `num = 5`, `k = 3`, Output: 1 (5 is not divisible by 3, but 6 is).
  - `num = 6`, `k = 3`, Output: 0 (6 is already divisible by 3).

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The brute force approach involves trying all possible operations (addition or subtraction of 1) from `num` until we find a special number.
- We start from `num` and keep adding or subtracting 1 until we find a number that is divisible by `k`.
- This approach is straightforward but inefficient for large inputs.

```cpp
int minOperations(int num, int k) {
    int operations = 0;
    while (num % k != 0) {
        num++;
        operations++;
    }
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k)$, where $k$ is the divisor, because in the worst case, we might need to add $k$ to `num` to make it divisible by $k$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we might need to perform many operations to find a special number, and the space complexity is low because we only use a few variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach involves finding the remainder of `num` divided by `k`.
- If the remainder is 0, then `num` is already a special number, and we return 0.
- If the remainder is not 0, we calculate the minimum number of operations required to make `num` a special number by either adding or subtracting the remainder from `num`.
- This approach is efficient because it directly calculates the minimum number of operations required.

```cpp
int minOperations(int num, int k) {
    int remainder = num % k;
    if (remainder == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return min(remainder, k - remainder);
    }
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only perform a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make `num` a special number, without trying all possible operations.
