## Satisfiability of Equality Equations
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/satisfiability-of-equality-equations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of strings `equations`, where each string is an equation in the form of either `"a==b"` or `"a!=b"`.
- Constraints: `1 <= equations.length <= 500`, `equations[i].length == 3`, `a` and `b` are lowercase letters.
- Expected Output: A boolean indicating whether the given equations are satisfiable.
- Key Requirements: Determine if it's possible to assign values to variables such that all equations are satisfied.
- Example Test Cases:
  - Input: `["a==b","b!=a"]` Output: `false` Explanation: There is no way to assign values to variables such that both equations are satisfied.
  - Input: `["b==a","a==b"]` Output: `true` Explanation: We can assign the same value to both `a` and `b`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible assignments of values to variables and check if all equations are satisfied.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible assignments of values (true or false) to variables.
  2. For each assignment, iterate through all equations and check if they are satisfied.
  3. If we find an assignment where all equations are satisfied, return true. If we've tried all assignments and none satisfy all equations, return false.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement by attempting to satisfy all conditions through brute force.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool equationsPossible(vector<string>& equations) {
    vector<bool> assignments(26, true); // Assuming 26 lowercase letters
    for (int i = 0; i < equations.size(); i++) {
        char a = equations[i][0], b = equations[i][3];
        if (equations[i][1] == '=') {
            // Try to assign the same value to a and b
            assignments[a - 'a'] = assignments[b - 'b'];
        } else {
            // Try to assign different values to a and b
            assignments[a - 'a'] = !assignments[b - 'b'];
        }
    }
    // Check all equations with the current assignment
    for (int i = 0; i < equations.size(); i++) {
        char a = equations[i][0], b = equations[i][3];
        if (equations[i][1] == '=') {
            if (assignments[a - 'a'] != assignments[b - 'b']) return false;
        } else {
            if (assignments[a - 'a'] == assignments[b - 'b']) return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{26} \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of equations. This is because we are trying all possible assignments of values to variables and then checking each equation for each assignment.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the assignments of values to variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high due to the brute force nature of trying all possible assignments, and the space complexity is low because we only need a fixed amount of space to store the assignments.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a union-find data structure to group variables that are equal.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a union-find data structure with each variable in its own set.
  2. Iterate through the equality equations and union the sets of variables that are equal.
  3. Iterate through the inequality equations and check if the variables are in the same set. If they are, return false.
  4. If we've checked all equations and haven't returned false, return true.
- This approach is optimal because it directly addresses the problem statement in a more efficient manner than the brute force approach.

```cpp
class UnionFind {
public:
    vector<int> parent;
    UnionFind(int n) : parent(n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    void unionSets(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
        }
    }
};

bool equationsPossible(vector<string>& equations) {
    UnionFind uf(26);
    // First, union the sets of variables that are equal
    for (const string& equation : equations) {
        if (equation[1] == '=') {
            uf.unionSets(equation[0] - 'a', equation[3] - 'a');
        }
    }
    // Then, check the inequality equations
    for (const string& equation : equations) {
        if (equation[1] == '!') {
            if (uf.find(equation[0] - 'a') == uf.find(equation[3] - 'a')) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \alpha(n))$, where $n$ is the number of equations and $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly. This is because we are using a union-find data structure to group variables that are equal.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store the parent array for the union-find data structure.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a union-find data structure to efficiently group variables that are equal, and it only needs to iterate through the equations twice.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not using a union-find data structure, not checking for inequality equations correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where there are no equations, handling the case where there are only equality equations.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a union-find data structure, which can lead to high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases and large inputs.
