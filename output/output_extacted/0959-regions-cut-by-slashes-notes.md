## Regions Cut by Slashes
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/regions-cut-by-slashes/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a list of strings representing a grid, where each string contains '/' or '\' characters, and the grid size is `n x n`.
- Expected output format: The output is the number of regions in the grid after all slashes have been applied.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The grid can be of any size, and the slashes can be in any orientation.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `[" /","/ "]` Output: `2`
  - Input: `[" /","  "]` Output: `1`
  - Input: `["\\","/"]` Output: `4`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Create a grid and apply each slash to the grid, then count the number of regions.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a grid with all cells set to `0`.
  2. For each slash, update the corresponding cells in the grid.
  3. Use a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of regions in the grid.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward way to solve the problem, but it may not be efficient for large grids.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int regionsBySlashes(vector<string>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        vector<vector<int>> g(n * 3, vector<int>(n * 3, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '/') {
                    g[i * 3][j * 3 + 2] = 1;
                    g[i * 3 + 1][j * 3 + 1] = 1;
                    g[i * 3 + 2][j * 3] = 1;
                }
                if (grid[i][j] == '\\') {
                    g[i * 3][j * 3] = 1;
                    g[i * 3 + 1][j * 3 + 1] = 1;
                    g[i * 3 + 2][j * 3 + 2] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n * 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n * 3; j++) {
                if (g[i][j] == 0) {
                    dfs(g, i, j);
                    res++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& g, int x, int y) {
        if (x < 0 || x >= g.size() || y < 0 || y >= g[0].size() || g[x][y] == 1) return;
        g[x][y] = 1;
        dfs(g, x + 1, y);
        dfs(g, x - 1, y);
        dfs(g, x, y + 1);
        dfs(g, x, y - 1);
    }
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where `n` is the size of the grid.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where `n` is the size of the grid.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is $O(n^2)$ because we iterate over the grid once to apply the slashes and again to count the regions. The space complexity is $O(n^2)$ because we create a new grid to store the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of the connected regions.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a Union-Find data structure with `n * n * 4` nodes, where each node represents a corner of a cell in the grid.
  2. For each cell in the grid, if there is no slash, union the corresponding nodes.
  3. For each slash, union the corresponding nodes.
  4. Count the number of connected regions by counting the number of roots in the Union-Find data structure.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a Union-Find data structure, which has an amortized time complexity of $O(\alpha(n))$, where $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.

```cpp
class UnionFind {
public:
    vector<int> parent;
    UnionFind(int n) : parent(n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) parent[i] = i;
    }
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }
    void unionNodes(int x, int y) {
        int rootx = find(x);
        int rooty = find(y);
        if (rootx != rooty) parent[rootx] = rooty;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int regionsBySlashes(vector<string>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        UnionFind uf(n * n * 4);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int index = (i * n + j) * 4;
                if (i > 0) uf.unionNodes(index, (i - 1) * n * 4 + j * 4 + 2);
                if (j > 0) uf.unionNodes(index + 3, i * n * 4 + (j - 1) * 4 + 1);
                if (grid[i][j] != '/') {
                    uf.unionNodes(index, index + 1);
                    uf.unionNodes(index + 2, index + 3);
                }
                if (grid[i][j] != '\\') {
                    uf.unionNodes(index, index + 3);
                    uf.unionNodes(index + 1, index + 2);
                }
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n * n * 4; i++) {
            if (uf.find(i) == i) res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Union-Find data structure, depth-first search (DFS).
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a Union-Find data structure to keep track of connected regions.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a Union-Find data structure to reduce the time complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve counting connected regions, such as "Number of Islands" and "Max Area of Island".

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the Union-Find data structure correctly, not using the `find` and `union` methods correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: The grid can be empty, the grid can have a size of 1, the grid can have all slashes or no slashes.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a naive approach that has a high time complexity, not using a Union-Find data structure.
- Testing considerations: Test the solution with different grid sizes, test the solution with different slash patterns, test the solution with edge cases.
