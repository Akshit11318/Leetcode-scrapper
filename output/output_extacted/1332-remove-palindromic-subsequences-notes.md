## Remove Palindromic Subsequences
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-palindromic-subsequences/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s`.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 1000`, `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- Expected Output: The minimum number of operations to remove all characters from `s` by only removing palindromic subsequences.
- Key Requirements: Identify palindromic subsequences and remove them in the minimum number of operations.
- Edge Cases: Single-character strings, already palindromic strings, non-palindromic strings.
- Example Test Cases:
  - Input: `"ababa"` - Output: `1` (Remove the entire string as it's a palindrome).
  - Input: `"abb"` - Output: `2` (Remove `"bb"` and then `"a"`).

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible subsequence to see if it's a palindrome and can be removed.
- Step-by-step breakdown: Generate all possible subsequences, check if each is a palindrome, and then try to remove them one by one to see the minimum number of operations required.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to ensure all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool isPalindrome(const string& s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] != s[right]) return false;
        left++, right--;
    }
    return true;
}

int removePalindromeSubseq(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    if (isPalindrome(s)) return 1;
    // Brute force approach would involve generating all subsequences and checking
    // However, this is highly inefficient and not practical for strings of length > 10
    // The idea here is to realize that for any non-palindromic string, we can remove all characters in 2 operations:
    // 1. Remove all one type of character (e.g., all 'a's).
    // 2. Remove the remaining characters (which are now all of another type, thus a palindrome).
    return 2;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    cout << removePalindromeSubseq(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the string, because in the worst case, we might need to check the entire string to determine if it's a palindrome.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ since we're not using any additional space that scales with input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the palindrome check, and the space complexity is constant because we're only using a fixed amount of space to store indices and the input string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Realize that any string can be reduced to an empty string in at most 2 operations by removing all occurrences of one character type first (if the string is not a palindrome), which leaves a palindrome that can be removed in one operation.
- Detailed breakdown: If the string is already a palindrome, it can be removed in one operation. If not, we can remove all characters of one type in the first operation and then remove the remaining characters (which form a palindrome) in the second operation.
- Proof of optimality: It's impossible to do better than 2 operations for non-palindromic strings because at least one operation is required to change the string, and a second operation is needed to remove the remaining characters, which could be a palindrome after the first operation.

```cpp
int removePalindromeSubseq(string s) {
    if (isPalindrome(s)) return 1;
    return 2;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the string, for checking if the string is a palindrome.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're using constant space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to remove all characters from any string, leveraging the property that any string can be reduced to a palindrome (or empty string) in at most one operation, and then removed in one operation.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concept: Understanding the properties of palindromes and how they can be manipulated.
- Problem-solving pattern: Identifying that the problem can be solved by considering the properties of the input string (palindromic or not) and applying a simple, logical approach.
- Optimization technique: Realizing that not all problems require complex algorithms; sometimes, a simple, logical approach can yield the optimal solution.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Overcomplicating the problem with unnecessary algorithms or data structures.
- Not considering the properties of palindromic strings and their implications for the problem.
- Failing to recognize that the optimal solution can often be found by considering the simplest, most straightforward approaches first.
