## Find the Largest Area of Square Inside Two Rectangles
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-largest-area-of-square-inside-two-rectangles/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two rectangles defined by their coordinates (x, y) and dimensions (w, h).
- Constraints: $0 \leq x, y, w, h \leq 10^5$.
- Expected output format: The largest area of a square that can fit inside both rectangles.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Rectangles may not intersect, may be identical, or one may be completely inside the other.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - When rectangles do not intersect, the area should be 0.
  - When one rectangle is completely inside the other, the area should be the area of the smaller rectangle.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Find all possible squares that can fit inside both rectangles and calculate their areas.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through all possible square sizes from 1 to the minimum side length of the two rectangles.
  2. For each square size, iterate through all possible positions within the rectangles.
  3. Check if the square can fit inside both rectangles at the current position.
  4. If it can, calculate the area of the square.
  5. Keep track of the maximum area found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, intuitive approach that checks all possibilities.

```cpp
int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
    int maxArea = 0;
    for (int size = 1; size <= min(min(C - A, D - B), min(G - E, H - F)); size++) {
        for (int x = A; x <= C - size; x++) {
            for (int y = B; y <= D - size; y++) {
                if (x + size <= G && y + size <= H && x >= E && y >= F) {
                    maxArea = max(maxArea, size * size);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^4)$ where $n$ is the minimum side length of the two rectangles. This is due to the four nested loops.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum area.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks all possible square sizes and positions, leading to high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The largest square that can fit inside both rectangles will have its sides equal to the minimum of the overlapping widths and heights of the two rectangles.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the overlapping width and height of the two rectangles.
  2. The side length of the largest square is the minimum of these two values.
  3. Calculate the area of the square.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the maximum possible square area without checking all possibilities.

```cpp
int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
    int overlapWidth = max(0, min(C, G) - max(A, E));
    int overlapHeight = max(0, min(D, H) - max(B, F));
    int sideLength = min(overlapWidth, overlapHeight);
    return sideLength * sideLength;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only perform a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the maximum possible square area without checking all possibilities, resulting in constant time complexity.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Direct calculation, minimization of overlapping areas.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Looking for the minimum of overlapping dimensions to find the maximum square area.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding brute force by directly calculating the optimal solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the maximum rectangle inside two rectangles, calculating the intersection area of two rectangles.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating the overlapping width and height, not handling cases where rectangles do not intersect.
- Edge cases to watch for: Rectangles not intersecting, one rectangle being completely inside the other.
- Performance pitfalls: Using brute force approaches for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with different rectangle positions and sizes.
