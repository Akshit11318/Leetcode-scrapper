## The Number of Seniors and Juniors to Join the Company II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-seniors-and-juniors-to-join-the-company-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves two integer arrays `seniors` and `juniors`, where each element represents the age of a senior or junior employee. The goal is to find the number of seniors and juniors that can join the company given certain constraints.
- Expected output format: The output should be the maximum number of seniors and juniors that can join the company.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The constraints include the maximum age difference allowed between seniors and juniors, as well as the requirement that each senior must be paired with a junior.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `seniors = [1,2,3,5]`, `juniors = [1,2,3,7]`, `difference = 3`. The output should be `3`.
  - Example 2: `seniors = [1,1,1]`, `juniors = [1,1,1]`, `difference = 0`. The output should be `1`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to use nested loops to iterate over the `seniors` and `juniors` arrays, checking each pair to see if the age difference is within the allowed limit.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `count` to store the maximum number of seniors and juniors that can join the company.
  2. Iterate over the `seniors` array.
  3. For each senior, iterate over the `juniors` array.
  4. Check if the age difference between the current senior and junior is within the allowed limit.
  5. If it is, increment the `count` variable.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it has a high time complexity due to the nested loops.

```cpp
int maxNumOfSeniors(vector<int>& seniors, vector<int>& juniors, int difference) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < seniors.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < juniors.size(); j++) {
            if (abs(seniors[i] - juniors[j]) <= difference) {
                count++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the size of the `seniors` array and $m$ is the size of the `juniors` array. This is because we are using nested loops to iterate over the arrays.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity occurs because we are checking every possible pair of seniors and juniors, resulting in a large number of iterations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can sort the `seniors` and `juniors` arrays, and then use a two-pointer technique to find the maximum number of seniors and juniors that can join the company.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the `seniors` and `juniors` arrays in ascending order.
  2. Initialize two pointers, `seniorPtr` and `juniorPtr`, to the beginning of the `seniors` and `juniors` arrays, respectively.
  3. Initialize a variable `count` to store the maximum number of seniors and juniors that can join the company.
  4. Iterate over the `seniors` array using the `seniorPtr`.
  5. For each senior, move the `juniorPtr` forward until we find a junior whose age is within the allowed limit of the current senior.
  6. If we find such a junior, increment the `count` variable and move the `seniorPtr` forward.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we are only iterating over the arrays once, resulting in a much lower time complexity than the brute force approach.

```cpp
int maxNumOfSeniors(vector<int>& seniors, vector<int>& juniors, int difference) {
    sort(seniors.begin(), seniors.end());
    sort(juniors.begin(), juniors.end());
    int count = 0;
    int seniorPtr = 0;
    int juniorPtr = 0;
    while (seniorPtr < seniors.size() && juniorPtr < juniors.size()) {
        if (abs(seniors[seniorPtr] - juniors[juniorPtr]) <= difference) {
            count++;
            seniorPtr++;
            juniorPtr++;
        } else if (seniors[seniorPtr] < juniors[juniorPtr]) {
            seniorPtr++;
        } else {
            juniorPtr++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + m \log m)$, where $n$ is the size of the `seniors` array and $m$ is the size of the `juniors` array. This is because we are sorting the arrays and then iterating over them once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable and the pointers.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: sorting, two-pointer technique.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using sorting and two pointers to find the maximum number of pairs that satisfy a certain condition.
- Optimization techniques learned: reducing the time complexity by using a more efficient algorithm.
- Similar problems to practice: problems involving finding the maximum number of pairs that satisfy a certain condition.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking for edge cases, such as an empty input array.
- Edge cases to watch for: handling cases where the input arrays are empty or have a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach with a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: testing the code with different input sizes and edge cases to ensure correctness and efficiency.
