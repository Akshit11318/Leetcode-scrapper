## Process Tasks Using Servers
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/process-tasks-using-servers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `servers`, `tasks`
- Constraints: `1 <= servers.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= tasks.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= weight[i] <= 10^4`, `1 <= processingTime[i] <= 10^4`
- Expected output: The `processingTime` at which each `task` is processed.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Ensure that each server is utilized efficiently, and that the `processingTime` is correctly calculated for each task.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Sort the `servers` based on their `weight` and `processingTime`.
- Iterate through each `task` and assign it to the server with the earliest available `processingTime`.
- Update the `processingTime` of the assigned server.

```cpp
vector<int> assignTasks(vector<vector<int>>& servers, vector<int>& tasks) {
    int n = servers.size(), m = tasks.size();
    vector<int> ans(m);
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        pq.push({0, i});
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int t = tasks[i];
        if (pq.empty()) {
            ans[i] = -1; // handle the case where there are no available servers
            continue;
        }
        auto [time, idx] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        ans[i] = max(i, time);
        pq.push({max(i, time) + servers[idx][1], idx});
    }
    return ans;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \log n)$, where $m$ is the number of tasks and $n$ is the number of servers. This is due to the use of a priority queue to manage the servers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of servers. This is due to the storage of the servers in the priority queue.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the iteration through each task and the use of the priority queue. The space complexity is due to the storage of the servers in the priority queue.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Use a priority queue to manage the servers, where the priority is the `processingTime` of the server.
- Iterate through each `task` and assign it to the server with the earliest available `processingTime`.
- Update the `processingTime` of the assigned server.

```cpp
vector<int> assignTasks(vector<vector<int>>& servers, vector<int>& tasks) {
    int n = servers.size(), m = tasks.size();
    vector<int> ans(m);
    priority_queue<pair<int, pair<int, int>>, vector<pair<int, pair<int, int>>>, greater<pair<int, pair<int, int>>>> pq;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        pq.push({0, {servers[i][0], i}});
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int t = tasks[i];
        auto [time, server] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        ans[i] = max(i, time);
        pq.push({max(i, time) + servers[server.second][1], server});
    }
    return ans;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: priority queues, sorting, and iteration.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using priority queues to manage resources, and iterating through each task to assign it to the most efficient resource.
- Optimization techniques learned: using priority queues to minimize the time complexity.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not handling the case where there are no available servers, or not updating the `processingTime` of the assigned server correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: ensuring that the `processingTime` is correctly calculated for each task, and handling the case where there are multiple servers with the same `weight` and `processingTime`.
- Performance pitfalls: using an inefficient data structure to manage the servers, such as a vector or array, instead of a priority queue.
