## Valid Perfect Square
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-perfect-square/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a non-negative integer `num`, determine if it is a perfect square.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if `num` is a perfect square, otherwise return `false`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where `num` is 0 or 1 (which are perfect squares), and cases where `num` is negative (which is not a valid input but is not present in this problem statement).
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `num = 16` returns `true` because `4^2 = 16`.
  - `num = 14` returns `false` because there is no integer `x` where `x^2 = 14`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One of the simplest ways to determine if a number is a perfect square is to iterate through all integers starting from 1 and check if the square of the integer equals the given number.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start with an integer `i = 1`.
  2. Calculate `i^2`.
  3. Check if `i^2 == num`. If true, return `true`.
  4. If `i^2 > num`, break the loop because any further squares will be larger.
  5. Increment `i` and repeat steps 2-4.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward method that directly checks for the condition of being a perfect square.

```cpp
bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
    if (num < 0) return false; // Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares
    if (num == 0 || num == 1) return true; // 0 and 1 are perfect squares

    int i = 1;
    while (i * i <= num) {
        if (i * i == num) return true;
        i++;
    }
    return false;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the input number `num`. This is because we are potentially iterating up to the square root of `num`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the while loop potentially running up to the square root of `num`, and the space complexity is constant because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of checking every integer up to the square root of `num`, we can use a binary search approach to find if there exists an integer `x` such that `x^2 == num`. This is because the sequence of squares of integers is monotonically increasing, making it suitable for binary search.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the range of possible values for `x`. Initially, `low = 1` and `high = num`.
  2. While `low <= high`, calculate the midpoint `mid` of the range.
  3. Calculate `mid^2`.
  4. If `mid^2 == num`, return `true`.
  5. If `mid^2 < num`, update `low` to `mid + 1`.
  6. If `mid^2 > num`, update `high` to `mid - 1`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it reduces the search space by half at each step, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.

```cpp
bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
    if (num < 0) return false; // Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares
    if (num == 0 || num == 1) return true; // 0 and 1 are perfect squares

    int low = 1, high = num;
    while (low <= high) {
        long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // Using long long to avoid overflow
        long long square = mid * mid;
        if (square == num) return true;
        if (square < num) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return false;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the input number `num`. This is because we are performing a binary search.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most efficient algorithm for this problem because it uses binary search, which is the fastest way to search in a sorted array or sequence.
