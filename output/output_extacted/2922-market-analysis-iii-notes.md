## Market Analysis III
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/market-analysis-iii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: `views`, `likes`, `replies`, `description`, `title`
- Constraints: 
  - The number of rows in the table will be in the range [1, 1000].
  - `id` will be a unique integer in the range [1, 1000].
  - `views`, `likes`, `replies` will be integers in the range [0, 1000].
  - `description` and `title` will be strings.
- Expected output format: The number of videos that satisfy all conditions
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling cases where `description` or `title` are empty strings
  - Ensuring `views`, `likes`, and `replies` are within the specified range
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Test case 1: One video with all conditions satisfied
  - Test case 2: Multiple videos with some conditions satisfied
  - Test case 3: No videos satisfy all conditions

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over each video and check if all conditions are satisfied.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a counter for videos that satisfy all conditions.
  2. Iterate over each video in the table.
  3. For each video, check if the `views` are greater than or equal to the threshold, the `likes` are greater than or equal to the threshold, and the `replies` are greater than or equal to the threshold.
  4. Also, check if the `description` contains the keyword and the `title` contains the keyword.
  5. If all conditions are satisfied, increment the counter.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be efficient for large datasets.

```cpp
int market_analysis(vector<vector<int>>& views, vector<int>& likes, vector<int>& replies, vector<string>& descriptions, vector<string>& titles, string keyword) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < views.size(); i++) {
        if (views[i][0] >= views[i][1] && likes[i] >= views[i][1] && replies[i] >= views[i][1] && descriptions[i].find(keyword) != string::npos && titles[i].find(keyword) != string::npos) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of videos, because we iterate over each video once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store the counter and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we iterate over each video, and the space complexity is constant because we use a fixed amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal in terms of time complexity because we must check each video at least once.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a counter for videos that satisfy all conditions.
  2. Iterate over each video in the table.
  3. For each video, check if the `views` are greater than or equal to the threshold, the `likes` are greater than or equal to the threshold, and the `replies` are greater than or equal to the threshold.
  4. Also, check if the `description` contains the keyword and the `title` contains the keyword.
  5. If all conditions are satisfied, increment the counter.
- Proof of optimality: The time complexity is optimal because we must check each video at least once.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We cannot avoid checking each video, so the time complexity is already optimal.

```cpp
int market_analysis(vector<vector<int>>& views, vector<int>& likes, vector<int>& replies, vector<string>& descriptions, vector<string>& titles, string keyword) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < views.size(); i++) {
        if (views[i][0] >= views[i][1] && likes[i] >= views[i][1] && replies[i] >= views[i][1] && descriptions[i].find(keyword) != string::npos && titles[i].find(keyword) != string::npos) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional checks, and string manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking each element in a dataset and counting the number of elements that satisfy certain conditions.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve checking each element in a dataset and counting the number of elements that satisfy certain conditions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Off-by-one errors, incorrect conditional checks, and incorrect string manipulation.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty strings, invalid input, and boundary cases.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases and boundary cases.
