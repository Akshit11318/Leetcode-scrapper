## Maximum Element Sum of a Complete Subset of Indices

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-element-sum-of-a-complete-subset-of-indices/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of integers `nums`, where each integer is represented as a pair of `(value, index)`, and a list of integers `k`, find the maximum element sum of a complete subset of indices.
- Expected output format: The maximum element sum.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The subset must be complete, meaning that for any pair of indices `(i, j)` in the subset, all indices `k` such that `i <= k <= j` must also be in the subset.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `nums = [(1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)]`, `k = [0, 1, 2, 3]`. The maximum element sum is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`.
  - `nums = [(1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)]`, `k = [0, 2]`. The maximum element sum is `1 + 3 = 4`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible subsets of indices and calculate the sum of elements for each subset.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of indices.
  2. For each subset, check if it is complete.
  3. For each complete subset, calculate the sum of elements.
  4. Keep track of the maximum sum found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that checks all possible subsets.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxSum(std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& nums, std::vector<int>& k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int max_sum = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        std::vector<int> subset;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                subset.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        if (isComplete(subset)) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i : subset) {
                sum += nums[i].first;
            }
            max_sum = std::max(max_sum, sum);
        }
    }
    return max_sum;
}

bool isComplete(std::vector<int>& subset) {
    std::sort(subset.begin(), subset.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < subset.size() - 1; i++) {
        if (subset[i + 1] - subset[i] > 1) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. The $2^n$ term comes from generating all possible subsets, and the $n \log n$ term comes from sorting the subset to check if it is complete.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we need to store the current subset.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates all possible subsets, which leads to an exponential time complexity. The sorting step adds a logarithmic factor to the time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to build up the maximum sum for each complete subset.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a table `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the maximum sum for the complete subset ending at index `i`.
  2. For each index `i`, calculate `dp[i]` by considering all possible previous indices `j` such that the subset from `j` to `i` is complete.
  3. Update `dp[i]` with the maximum sum found.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, which is optimal because we need to consider all pairs of indices.

```cpp
int maxSum(std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& nums, std::vector<int>& k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> dp(n, 0);
    dp[0] = nums[0].first;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i] = nums[i].first;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (isComplete(j, i)) {
                dp[i] = std::max(dp[i], dp[j] + nums[i].first);
            }
        }
    }
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

bool isComplete(int j, int i) {
    for (int k = j + 1; k < i; k++) {
        if (nums[k].second != nums[k - 1].second + 1) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, subset generation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems, using dynamic programming to build up the solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the knapsack problem or the longest common subsequence problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` table correctly, not considering all possible previous indices when calculating `dp[i]`.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input, input with a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an exponential-time algorithm when a polynomial-time algorithm is possible.
- Testing considerations: Testing with small inputs to verify the correctness of the implementation, testing with large inputs to verify the performance.
