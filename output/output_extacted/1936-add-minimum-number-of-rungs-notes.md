## Add Minimum Number of Rungs
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/add-minimum-number-of-rungs/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: You are given a list of integers `ladders` representing the heights of rungs on a ladder, and an integer `k` representing the maximum distance between two rungs.
- Expected output format: Return the minimum number of additional rungs that need to be added to the ladder such that the distance between any two adjacent rungs does not exceed `k`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input list `ladders` is sorted in ascending order, and `k` is a positive integer.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `ladders = [3,6,8,10]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `1` because we can add a rung at height `9` to satisfy the condition.
  - For `ladders = [3,6,8,10]` and `k = 2`, the output should be `3` because we need to add rungs at heights `4`, `5`, and `9` to satisfy the condition.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating over the list of ladders and checking the distance between each pair of adjacent rungs. If the distance exceeds `k`, we add a new rung at the maximum possible height that does not exceed `k`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `count` to store the number of additional rungs needed.
  2. Iterate over the list of ladders.
  3. For each pair of adjacent rungs, calculate the distance between them.
  4. If the distance exceeds `k`, calculate the number of new rungs needed to bring the distance within `k`.
  5. Update the `count` variable accordingly.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be the most efficient solution.

```cpp
int addRungs(vector<int>& ladders, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < ladders.size(); i++) {
        int diff = ladders[i] - ladders[i - 1];
        if (diff > k) {
            count += (diff - 1) / k;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of ladders, because we are iterating over the list of ladders once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are iterating over the list of ladders, and the space complexity is constant because we are using a fixed amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using the same approach as the brute force solution, but with a more efficient implementation.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable `count` to store the number of additional rungs needed.
  2. Iterate over the list of ladders.
  3. For each pair of adjacent rungs, calculate the distance between them.
  4. If the distance exceeds `k`, calculate the number of new rungs needed to bring the distance within `k`.
  5. Update the `count` variable accordingly.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it has a linear time complexity and uses a constant amount of space.

```cpp
int addRungs(vector<int>& ladders, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < ladders.size(); i++) {
        int diff = ladders[i] - ladders[i - 1];
        if (diff > k) {
            count += (diff - 1) / k;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of ladders, because we are iterating over the list of ladders once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it has a linear time complexity and uses a constant amount of space, making it the most efficient solution possible.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem demonstrates the use of iteration and conditional statements to solve a problem.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem involves identifying the distance between each pair of adjacent rungs and calculating the number of new rungs needed to bring the distance within `k`.
- Optimization techniques learned: The problem involves optimizing the solution by using a more efficient implementation.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve iteration and conditional statements, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a list.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: One common error is to forget to initialize the `count` variable or to use an incorrect formula to calculate the number of new rungs needed.
- Edge cases to watch for: One edge case is when the distance between two adjacent rungs is equal to `k`, in which case no new rungs are needed.
- Performance pitfalls: One performance pitfall is to use a nested loop to iterate over the list of ladders, which would result in a quadratic time complexity.
- Testing considerations: The solution should be tested with different input values, including edge cases, to ensure that it produces the correct output.
