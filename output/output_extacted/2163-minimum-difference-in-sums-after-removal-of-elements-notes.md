## Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-in-sums-after-removal-of-elements/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two arrays of integers `nums1` and `nums2`, and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= k <= min(length of nums1, length of nums2)`.
- Output: The minimum possible difference between the sums of two arrays after removing `k` elements from each array.
- Key requirements: Find the minimum difference by considering all possible combinations of removing `k` elements from each array.
- Example test cases:
  - `nums1 = [1, 7, 5], nums2 = [2, 3, 4], k = 1`. Expected output: `2`.
  - `nums1 = [2, 7, 6], nums2 = [1, 4, 10], k = 1`. Expected output: `2`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves generating all possible combinations of removing `k` elements from each array and calculating the difference in sums.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all combinations of `k` indices for `nums1` and `nums2`.
  2. For each pair of combinations, calculate the sums of the remaining elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.
  3. Calculate the absolute difference between the sums.
  4. Keep track of the minimum difference found.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k) {
    int n = nums1.size();
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;

    // Generate all combinations of k indices
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
        if (__builtin_popcount(mask) != k) continue;

        int sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) == 0) sum1 += nums1[i];
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) == 0) sum2 += nums2[i];
        }

        minDiff = min(minDiff, abs(sum1 - sum2));
    }

    return minDiff;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums1` (or `nums2`). The $2^n$ factor comes from generating all possible combinations of `k` indices, and the $n$ factor comes from calculating the sums for each combination.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space required for the input arrays.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible combinations, which leads to an exponential time complexity. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the minimum difference and other variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution involves using a two-pointer technique to find the minimum difference between the sums of two arrays after removing `k` elements.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Sort `nums1` and `nums2` in ascending order.
  2. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the beginning of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.
  3. Initialize the sums of `nums1` and `nums2` by summing all elements.
  4. Remove `k` elements from `nums1` and `nums2` by subtracting the smallest elements from the sums.
  5. Calculate the absolute difference between the updated sums.
  6. Keep track of the minimum difference found.

```cpp
int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k) {
    sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    sort(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());

    int sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
    for (int num : nums1) sum1 += num;
    for (int num : nums2) sum2 += num;

    int minDiff = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i <= k; ++i) {
        int tempSum1 = sum1;
        int tempSum2 = sum2;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            tempSum1 -= nums1[j];
            tempSum2 -= nums2[j];
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < k - i; ++j) {
            tempSum1 -= nums1[nums1.size() - 1 - j];
            tempSum2 -= nums2[nums2.size() - 1 - j];
        }
        minDiff = min(minDiff, abs(tempSum1 - tempSum2));
    }

    return minDiff;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + k^2)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums1` (or `nums2`). The $n \log n$ factor comes from sorting the arrays, and the $k^2$ factor comes from removing `k` elements and calculating the sums.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space required for the input arrays.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it involves sorting the arrays and removing the smallest elements, which minimizes the difference between the sums.
