## Encode Number
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-number/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A non-negative integer `num`.
- Output: The encoded number as a string, using the `encodeNumber` function.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input `num` can range from 0 to 2^31 - 1.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - `encodeNumber(0)` returns "0".
  - `encodeNumber(1)` returns "1".
  - `encodeNumber(12345)` returns the encoded string representation of the number.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can directly convert the integer into a string and return it.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Convert the integer to a string using the `to_string` function.
  2. Return the resulting string.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This is the most straightforward way to solve the problem.

```cpp
string encodeNumber(int num) {
    return to_string(num);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log n)$, where n is the input number, because converting an integer to a string takes time proportional to the number of digits in the integer.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(\log n)$, because the resulting string has a length proportional to the number of digits in the integer.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because the `to_string` function iterates over each digit in the integer, converting it to a character and adding it to the resulting string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem statement doesn't specify any particular encoding scheme, so the most efficient encoding scheme is to simply convert the integer to a string.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Convert the integer to a string using the `to_string` function.
  2. Return the resulting string.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(\log n)$ and a space complexity of $O(\log n)$, which is the best possible complexity for this problem.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must at least iterate over each digit in the integer to convert it to a string.

```cpp
string encodeNumber(int num) {
    return to_string(num);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log n)$, where n is the input number, because converting an integer to a string takes time proportional to the number of digits in the integer.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(\log n)$, because the resulting string has a length proportional to the number of digits in the integer.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has the best possible time and space complexities for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: String conversion, time and space complexity analysis.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct conversion is often the most efficient approach when no specific encoding scheme is specified.
- Optimization techniques learned: Analyzing the time and space complexities of different approaches to determine the most efficient solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string conversion problems, such as converting integers to hexadecimal or binary strings.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to handle edge cases, such as negative integers or integers with leading zeros.
- Edge cases to watch for: Negative integers, integers with leading zeros, and integers with a large number of digits.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient encoding schemes or algorithms with high time or space complexities.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and large integers.
