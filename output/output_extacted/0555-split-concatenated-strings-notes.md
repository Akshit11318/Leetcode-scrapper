## Split Concatenated Strings
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/split-concatenated-strings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 200`.
- Expected output format: return `true` if a split is possible, `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements: find a way to split the string `s` into the concatenation of two strings `a` and `b` such that `a` and `b` are not empty, and the concatenation of `b` and `a` is also a valid split.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `s = "abcabc"`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: We can split the string as `"abc" + "abc"`, and the concatenation of `"abc"` and `"abc"` is `"abcabc"`, which is a valid split.
  - Input: `s = "aaaaaa"`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: We can split the string as `"aa" + "aaaa"`, and the concatenation of `"aaaa"` and `"aa"` is `"aaaaaa"`, which is a valid split.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: try all possible splits of the string `s` and check if the concatenation of the two parts is a valid split.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible splits of the string `s`.
  2. For each split, check if the concatenation of the two parts is a valid split.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: it's a straightforward and intuitive approach to solve the problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isConcatenated(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            string a = s.substr(0, i);
            string b = s.substr(i);
            if (isConcatenatedHelper(a, b)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    bool isConcatenatedHelper(string a, string b) {
        string concatenated = b + a;
        int n = concatenated.length();
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            string a1 = concatenated.substr(0, i);
            string b1 = concatenated.substr(i);
            if (a1 == a && b1 == b) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we have two nested loops that iterate over the string, and inside the loops, we perform a string concatenation operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we create new strings in the `isConcatenated` and `isConcatenatedHelper` methods.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time and space complexities because we generate all possible splits of the string and perform string concatenation operations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: instead of generating all possible splits of the string `s`, we can use a hashmap to store the substrings of `s` and check if the concatenation of two substrings is a valid split.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Create a hashmap to store the substrings of `s`.
  2. Iterate over the string `s` and check if the concatenation of two substrings is a valid split.
- Proof of optimality: this approach is optimal because we only iterate over the string `s` once and use a hashmap to store the substrings, which reduces the time complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isConcatenated(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        unordered_set<string> substrings;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            string a = s.substr(0, i);
            string b = s.substr(i);
            if (isConcatenatedHelper(a, b, substrings)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    bool isConcatenatedHelper(string a, string b, unordered_set<string>& substrings) {
        string concatenated = b + a;
        int n = concatenated.length();
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            string a1 = concatenated.substr(0, i);
            string b1 = concatenated.substr(i);
            if (substrings.count(a1) && substrings.count(b1)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        substrings.insert(a);
        substrings.insert(b);
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: string manipulation, hashmap usage, and optimization techniques.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using a hashmap to store substrings and checking for valid splits.
- Optimization techniques learned: reducing time complexity by using a hashmap and iterating over the string only once.
- Similar problems to practice: string manipulation problems, such as finding the longest common substring or the shortest common supersequence.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking for edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with only one character.
- Edge cases to watch for: strings with repeated characters or strings with a length of 1.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach or not optimizing the solution.
- Testing considerations: testing the solution with different inputs, such as strings with different lengths or characters.
