## Maximum XOR After Operations
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-after-operations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`.
- Expected output format: The maximum XOR of any two numbers in the array after applying bitwise AND operations with any number in the array.
- Key requirements: Find the maximum XOR after applying bitwise AND operations with any number in the array.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `nums = [2, 4]`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: `2 AND 2 = 2`, `2 XOR 2 = 0`, `4 AND 4 = 4`, `4 XOR 4 = 0`, `2 AND 4 = 0`, `2 XOR 4 = 6`, `4 AND 2 = 0`, `4 XOR 2 = 6`. The maximum XOR is `6`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to apply the bitwise AND operation with every possible pair of numbers in the array and then find the XOR of the result.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible pairs of numbers from the array.
  2. For each pair, apply the bitwise AND operation.
  3. For each result, find the XOR with every number in the array.
  4. Keep track of the maximum XOR found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to explore all possibilities, but it's inefficient due to its high time complexity.

```cpp
int maximumXORAfterOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int max_xor = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            int and_result = nums[i] & nums[j];
            for (int k = 0; k < nums.size(); k++) {
                int xor_result = and_result ^ nums[k];
                max_xor = max(max_xor, xor_result);
            }
        }
    }
    return max_xor;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, due to the three nested loops.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as no additional space is used that scales with input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach explores all possible pairs of numbers and then applies XOR with every number, leading to a cubic time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The maximum XOR after applying bitwise AND operations with any number in the array can be found by considering the properties of bitwise operations.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. The maximum XOR of two numbers $a$ and $b$ is $a \oplus b$.
  2. The bitwise AND operation with any number $c$ will not increase the maximum XOR, as $a \& c$ and $b \& c$ will either be equal or less than $a$ and $b$.
  3. Therefore, we can simply find the maximum XOR of any two numbers in the array without considering the bitwise AND operation.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly finds the maximum XOR without unnecessary operations.

```cpp
int maximumXORAfterOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int max_xor = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            int xor_result = nums[i] ^ nums[j];
            max_xor = max(max_xor, xor_result);
        }
    }
    return max_xor;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as no additional space is used that scales with input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly finds the maximum XOR without considering unnecessary operations.
