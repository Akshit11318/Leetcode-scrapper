## Minimum Penalty for a Shop
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-penalty-for-a-shop/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input consists of a 2D array `items` where each element is an array of two integers representing the penalty and the quality of an item. The goal is to find the minimum penalty to buy `k` items, where `k` is a given integer.
- Expected output format: The function should return the minimum penalty.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input array can be empty, and `k` can be larger than the number of items.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If `items = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `k = 2`, the function should return `4` because we can buy the first item with a penalty of `1` and the second item with a penalty of `3`, and then return the second item to get a penalty of `1 + 3 - 3 = 1`, and then buy the first item again to get a total penalty of `1 + 3 = 4`.
  - If `items = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `k = 3`, the function should return `6` because we can buy the first item with a penalty of `1`, the second item with a penalty of `3`, and then buy the first item again to get a total penalty of `1 + 3 + 2 = 6`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach is to try all possible combinations of buying and returning items to find the minimum penalty.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: We can use a recursive function to try all possible combinations of buying and returning items.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is intuitive because it tries all possible solutions.

```cpp
int minimumPenalty(vector<vector<int>>& items, int k) {
    int n = items.size();
    int minPenalty = INT_MAX;
    
    function<void(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int i, int count, int penalty) {
        if (i == n || count == k) {
            minPenalty = min(minPenalty, penalty);
            return;
        }
        
        // Buy the item
        dfs(i + 1, count + 1, penalty + items[i][0]);
        
        // Return the item
        if (count > 0) {
            dfs(i + 1, count - 1, penalty - items[i][0]);
        }
    };
    
    dfs(0, 0, 0);
    
    return minPenalty;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$ because we try all possible combinations of buying and returning items.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ because of the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations of buying and returning items, which leads to an exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to store the minimum penalty for each number of items bought.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: We can use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum penalty to buy `j` items from the first `i` items.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of buying and returning items.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The dynamic programming approach has a polynomial time complexity, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
int minimumPenalty(vector<vector<int>>& items, int k) {
    int n = items.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, INT_MAX));
    
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
            // Don't buy the item
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
            
            // Buy the item
            if (j > 0) {
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + items[i - 1][0]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][k];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(nk)$ because we fill up the `dp` array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(nk)$ because of the `dp` array.
> - **Optimality proof:** The dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of buying and returning items.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming and recursion.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using dynamic programming to store the minimum penalty for each number of items bought.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the 0/1 knapsack problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` array correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where `k` is larger than the number of items.
- Performance pitfalls: Using the brute force approach, which has an exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
