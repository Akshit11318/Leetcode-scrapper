## Vowel Spellchecker
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/vowel-spellchecker/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: The problem takes in three parameters: `wordlist`, `queries`, and returns a list of strings.
- Input constraints: `1 <= wordlist.length <= 5000`, `1 <= queries.length <= 5000`, `1 <= wordlist[i].length <= 7`, `1 <= queries[i].length <= 7`.
- Expected output format: The function should return a list of strings, where each string is the first word in `wordlist` that matches the corresponding query.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - A word matches a query if they are identical or if the query is a prefix of the word with all vowels replaced by a wildcard character.
  - If no word in `wordlist` matches the query, return an empty string.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `wordlist = ["word","world","row","word"]`, `queries = ["word","world","row","word"]`. The function should return `["word","world","row","word"]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate through each query and check every word in the `wordlist` to see if it matches.
- We can use a simple string comparison for identical matches and a custom function to check for prefix matches with vowels replaced by a wildcard character.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement without requiring any additional data structures or complex algorithms.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

vector<string> spellchecker(vector<string>& wordlist, vector<string>& queries) {
    vector<string> result;
    for (const string& query : queries) {
        bool found = false;
        for (const string& word : wordlist) {
            if (word == query) {
                result.push_back(word);
                found = true;
                break;
            }
            if (word.size() >= query.size()) {
                bool match = true;
                for (int i = 0; i < query.size(); ++i) {
                    if (query[i] != word[i] && query[i] != '*' && word[i] != 'a' && word[i] != 'e' && word[i] != 'i' && word[i] != 'o' && word[i] != 'u') {
                        match = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (match) {
                    result.push_back(word);
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        if (!found) {
            result.push_back("");
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times m \times k)$, where $n$ is the number of queries, $m$ is the number of words in the `wordlist`, and $k$ is the maximum length of a word. This is because we are iterating through each query, then through each word, and finally checking each character in the word.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of queries. This is because we are storing the result for each query.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is straightforward but inefficient because it involves nested loops and string comparisons, leading to high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a combination of sets and maps to store the words and their variants with vowels replaced by a wildcard character.
- We can then iterate through each query and check if it matches any word in the sets or maps.
- This approach is optimal because it reduces the time complexity of checking each query from $O(m \times k)$ to $O(k)$.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>

vector<string> spellchecker(vector<string>& wordlist, vector<string>& queries) {
    unordered_set<string> words;
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> prefix, vowel;
    
    for (const string& word : wordlist) {
        words.insert(word);
        string v = word;
        for (char& c : v) {
            if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u') {
                c = '*';
            }
        }
        vowel[v].push_back(word);
        for (int i = 1; i <= word.size(); ++i) {
            string p = word.substr(0, i);
            prefix[p].push_back(word);
        }
    }
    
    vector<string> result;
    for (const string& query : queries) {
        if (words.count(query)) {
            result.push_back(query);
        } else {
            string v = query;
            for (char& c : v) {
                if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u') {
                    c = '*';
                }
            }
            if (vowel.count(v)) {
                result.push_back(vowel[v][0]);
            } else {
                for (int i = 1; i <= query.size(); ++i) {
                    string p = query.substr(0, i);
                    if (prefix.count(p)) {
                        result.push_back(prefix[p][0]);
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (result.size() == queries.size()) {
                    result.push_back("");
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times k + m \times k)$, where $n$ is the number of queries, $m$ is the number of words in the `wordlist`, and $k$ is the maximum length of a word. This is because we are iterating through each query and each word to build the sets and maps, and then checking each query against the sets and maps.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \times k)$, where $m$ is the number of words in the `wordlist` and $k$ is the maximum length of a word. This is because we are storing all the words and their variants in the sets and maps.

- The use of string manipulation to replace vowels with a wildcard character.
- The concept of prefix matching to find words that match a query.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not using data structures to reduce time complexity.
- Not handling edge cases such as empty strings or queries.
- Not using string manipulation to replace vowels with a wildcard character.
- Not using prefix matching to find words that match a query.
