## Find Subsequence of Length K with the Largest Sum
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-subsequence-of-length-k-with-the-largest-sum/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the subsequence of length `k` with the largest sum.
- Expected output format: Return the subsequence as a list of integers.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The subsequence must have exactly `k` elements, and the sum of the elements in the subsequence must be maximized.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `nums = [2,1,3,3]` and `k = 2`, the output should be `[3,3]` because the sum of this subsequence is `6`, which is the maximum possible sum for a subsequence of length `2`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward approach to solve this problem is to generate all possible subsequences of length `k` from the given array `nums` and then calculate the sum of each subsequence.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsequences of length `k` from `nums`.
  2. For each subsequence, calculate its sum.
  3. Keep track of the subsequence with the maximum sum found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a natural first step to consider all possible solutions (subsequences) and evaluate them one by one.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> maxSubsequence(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Generate all possible subsequences of length k
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    std::vector<int> maxSubseq;
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;
    
    std::function<void(int, std::vector<int>&)> backtrack = 
        [&backtrack, &nums, &visited, &maxSubseq, &maxSum, &k](int start, std::vector<int>& currentSubseq) {
            if (currentSubseq.size() == k) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int num : currentSubseq) {
                    sum += num;
                }
                if (sum > maxSum) {
                    maxSum = sum;
                    maxSubseq = currentSubseq;
                }
                return;
            }
            
            for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
                if (!visited[i]) {
                    visited[i] = true;
                    currentSubseq.push_back(nums[i]);
                    backtrack(i + 1, currentSubseq);
                    currentSubseq.pop_back();
                    visited[i] = false;
                }
            }
        };
    
    std::vector<int> currentSubseq;
    backtrack(0, currentSubseq);
    
    return maxSubseq;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$ because in the worst case, we generate all possible subsequences of the given array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the current subsequence and the maximum subsequence found.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible subsequences, which leads to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the recursive call stack and the storage of the maximum subsequence.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a priority queue to keep track of the `k` largest numbers in the array, as the sum of these numbers will be the maximum possible sum for a subsequence of length `k`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a priority queue with the first `k` elements of the array.
  2. Iterate over the rest of the array, and for each element, if it's larger than the smallest element in the priority queue, remove the smallest element and add the current element to the queue.
  3. The elements in the priority queue at the end will be the subsequence with the maximum sum.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that we always keep the `k` largest numbers in the array, which will result in the maximum possible sum for a subsequence of length `k`.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a linear time complexity and uses a priority queue to efficiently keep track of the `k` largest numbers, making it the optimal solution.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

std::vector<int> maxSubsequence(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> pq;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (pq.size() < k) {
            pq.push(num);
        } else if (num > pq.top()) {
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(num);
        }
    }
    
    std::vector<int> maxSubseq;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        maxSubseq.push_back(pq.top());
        pq.pop();
    }
    
    std::reverse(maxSubseq.begin(), maxSubseq.end());
    
    return maxSubseq;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log k)$ because we iterate over the array and perform priority queue operations, which take logarithmic time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$ for storing the priority queue.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach ensures that we keep the `k` largest numbers in the array, resulting in the maximum possible sum for a subsequence of length `k`. The use of a priority queue allows for efficient maintenance of these `k` largest numbers.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Priority queues, subsequence generation, and optimization techniques.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using priority queues to keep track of the `k` largest numbers in an array.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing time complexity by using efficient data structures like priority queues.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the maximum subarray sum, finding the `k`th largest element in an array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly implementing the priority queue or not handling edge cases properly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `k` is larger than the size of the array or where the array is empty.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures that lead to high time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with different input sizes, edge cases, and corner cases to ensure correctness and efficiency.
