## Minimum Number of Food Buckets to Feed the Hamsters
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-food-buckets-to-feed-the-hamsters/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an integer array `hamsters` where `hamsters[i]` is the food requirement of the `i-th` hamster, and an integer `limit`, return the minimum number of buckets needed to feed all the hamsters, where each bucket can hold `limit` units of food.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of buckets required.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The total food requirement of the hamsters should not exceed the total capacity of the buckets.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - If `hamsters = [1,2,3]` and `limit = 3`, the minimum number of buckets needed is `2`, because one bucket can hold `3` units of food for the first and second hamsters, and the second bucket can hold `3` units of food for the third hamster.
    - If `hamsters = [3,1,2]` and `limit = 3`, the minimum number of buckets needed is `2`, because one bucket can hold `3` units of food for the first hamster, and the second bucket can hold `3` units of food for the second and third hamsters.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can calculate the total food requirement of all the hamsters and then divide it by the capacity of each bucket to get the minimum number of buckets needed.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Calculate the total food requirement of all the hamsters.
    2. Divide the total food requirement by the capacity of each bucket and round up to the nearest integer.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it may not be the most efficient solution.

```cpp
int minimumBuckets(vector<int>& hamsters, int limit) {
    int totalFood = 0;
    for (int food : hamsters) {
        totalFood += food;
    }
    return (totalFood + limit - 1) / limit;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of hamsters, because we need to iterate over all the hamsters to calculate their total food requirement.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only need a constant amount of space to store the total food requirement and the minimum number of buckets needed.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we need to iterate over all the hamsters, and the space complexity is constant because we only need a fixed amount of space to store the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach, because we need to calculate the total food requirement of all the hamsters and then divide it by the capacity of each bucket to get the minimum number of buckets needed.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Calculate the total food requirement of all the hamsters.
    2. Divide the total food requirement by the capacity of each bucket and round up to the nearest integer.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it uses the minimum number of buckets needed to feed all the hamsters.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we need to feed all the hamsters, and this solution uses the minimum number of buckets needed to do so.

```cpp
int minimumBuckets(vector<int>& hamsters, int limit) {
    int totalFood = 0;
    for (int food : hamsters) {
        totalFood += food;
    }
    return (totalFood + limit - 1) / limit;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of hamsters, because we need to iterate over all the hamsters to calculate their total food requirement.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only need a constant amount of space to store the total food requirement and the minimum number of buckets needed.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it uses the minimum number of buckets needed to feed all the hamsters.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem demonstrates the use of basic arithmetic operations to solve a real-world problem.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires calculating the total food requirement of all the hamsters and then dividing it by the capacity of each bucket to get the minimum number of buckets needed.
- Optimization techniques learned: The problem does not require any optimization techniques, because the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Similar problems to practice include calculating the minimum number of items needed to meet a certain demand, or calculating the minimum number of resources needed to complete a task.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: A common implementation error is to forget to round up to the nearest integer when dividing the total food requirement by the capacity of each bucket.
- Edge cases to watch for: An edge case to watch for is when the total food requirement is exactly divisible by the capacity of each bucket, in which case we do not need to round up.
- Performance pitfalls: A performance pitfall is to use a loop to calculate the minimum number of buckets needed, instead of using a single arithmetic operation.
- Testing considerations: A testing consideration is to test the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly in all scenarios.
