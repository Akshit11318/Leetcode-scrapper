## Count of Integers
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-integers/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-integers/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an integer `n`, find the number of integers from `1` to `n` (inclusive) that are not divisible by either `2` or `3`.
- Expected output format: The count of integers.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle edge cases where `n` is `0`, `1`, or a negative number.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `n = 5`, the integers are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`. Only `1` and `5` are not divisible by `2` or `3`, so the output is `2`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over all integers from `1` to `n` and check if each integer is not divisible by either `2` or `3`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a counter variable `count` to `0`.
  2. Iterate over all integers `i` from `1` to `n`.
  3. For each `i`, check if it is not divisible by `2` and not divisible by `3`.
  4. If the condition is met, increment `count`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly checks each integer, ensuring we do not miss any integers that meet the criteria.

```cpp
int countOfIntegers(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 != 0 && i % 3 != 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we iterate over all integers from `1` to `n`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The iteration over all integers leads to linear time complexity, and the constant space usage is due to only having a single variable to keep track of the count.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Realize that the pattern of numbers not divisible by `2` or `3` repeats every `6` numbers (i.e., `1`, `5` in every `6` numbers).
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate how many complete sets of `6` numbers are there from `1` to `n`.
  2. Determine the remaining numbers after the last complete set of `6`.
  3. Count the numbers not divisible by `2` or `3` in the remaining numbers.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it avoids checking each number individually, reducing the time complexity significantly.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach takes advantage of the periodic nature of the problem, making it the most efficient.

```cpp
int countOfIntegers(int n) {
    int count = (n / 6) * 2; // Complete sets of 6
    int remainder = n % 6;
    if (remainder >= 1) count++; // 1 is not divisible by 2 or 3
    if (remainder >= 5) count++; // 5 is not divisible by 2 or 3
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we perform a constant number of operations regardless of `n`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The use of the repeating pattern allows us to calculate the result directly, achieving constant time complexity.
