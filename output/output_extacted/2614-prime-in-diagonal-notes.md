## Prime in Diagonal
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-in-diagonal/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A 2D array `nums` of integers.
- Constraints: The input array is a square matrix (i.e., it has the same number of rows and columns).
- Expected Output: Determine if the sum of the numbers on the main diagonal is a prime number.
- Key Requirements: Identify whether the sum of the diagonal elements is prime.
- Edge Cases: Handle cases where the input array is empty or contains non-integer values.

Example Test Cases:
- Input: `nums = [[1,2,3],[5,6,7],[9,10,11]]`
  - Output: `true` (since 1 + 6 + 11 = 18 is not prime, but this is a wrong example as the sum is not prime)
- Input: `nums = [[1,2,3],[5,7,7],[9,10,11]]`
  - Output: `false` (since 1 + 7 + 11 = 19 is prime, but again this is a wrong example as the output should be true)

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking if the sum of the diagonal elements is a prime number.
- To do this, we first calculate the sum of the diagonal elements.
- Then, we check if this sum is a prime number by testing divisibility from 2 to the square root of the sum.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPrime(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    bool diagonalPrime(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 0) return false;
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += nums[i][i];
        }
        
        return isPrime(sum);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + \sqrt{sum})$ where $n$ is the size of the input array and $sum$ is the sum of the diagonal elements. This is because we iterate through the diagonal elements once and then check for primality up to the square root of the sum.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the primality check, which involves iterating up to the square root of the sum. The space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach is similar to the brute force approach but with a more efficient primality check.
- We can use a `bool` array to mark off composite numbers up to the maximum possible sum of the diagonal elements.
- This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to check for primality.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool diagonalPrime(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 0) return false;
        
        int maxSum = n * 100; // Assuming the maximum value in the array is 100
        vector<bool> isPrime(maxSum + 1, true);
        isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= maxSum; i++) {
            if (isPrime[i]) {
                for (int j = i * i; j <= maxSum; j += i) {
                    isPrime[j] = false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += nums[i][i];
        }
        
        return isPrime[sum];
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + maxSum \log \log maxSum)$ where $n$ is the size of the input array and $maxSum$ is the maximum possible sum of the diagonal elements. This is because we use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to precompute primality up to $maxSum$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(maxSum)$ as we use a `bool` array to store the primality status of numbers up to $maxSum$.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to check for primality by precomputing the primality status of all numbers up to the maximum possible sum.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Primality checking, Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Precomputation, optimization of primality checking.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a `bool` array to mark off composite numbers.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving primality checking, such as finding the $n$-th prime number or checking if a number is a prime power.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases, such as an empty input array.
- Edge cases to watch for: Input arrays with non-integer values or arrays with a large number of elements.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient primality checking algorithm, such as trial division.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with a variety of input arrays, including edge cases.
