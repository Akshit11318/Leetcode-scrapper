## Earliest Second to Mark Indices II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-second-to-mark-indices-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the earliest second to mark the indices of the elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `k`.
- Expected output format: Return a list of indices where the elements are greater than or equal to `k`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where `k` is larger than all elements in `nums`, or where `nums` is empty.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `nums = [3, 2, 1]`, `k = 2`. Output: `[0, 1]`.
  - Example 2: Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, `k = 4`. Output: `[]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over the `nums` array and check each element to see if it's greater than or equal to `k`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the indices of elements greater than or equal to `k`.
  2. Iterate over the `nums` array using a for loop, keeping track of the current index `i`.
  3. For each element, check if it's greater than or equal to `k`. If it is, add the current index `i` to the `result` list.
  4. After iterating over the entire array, return the `result` list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, intuitive solution that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
vector<int> earliestSecondToMarkIndicesII(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] >= k) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the `nums` array, since we're iterating over the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, since in the worst-case scenario (where all elements are greater than or equal to `k`), the size of the `result` list will be equal to the size of the `nums` array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we're doing a constant amount of work for each element in the array. The space complexity is also linear because we're potentially storing every index in the `result` list.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal because we must examine every element in the `nums` array at least once to determine if it's greater than or equal to `k`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach is the same as the brute force approach.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem since we must examine every element in the `nums` array.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must do at least a constant amount of work for each element in the array, resulting in a time complexity of at least $O(n)$.

```cpp
vector<int> earliestSecondToMarkIndicesII(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] >= k) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional statements, and dynamic array manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Examining each element in an array to determine if it meets a certain condition.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, since the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve examining each element in an array, such as finding the maximum or minimum element.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Off-by-one errors when iterating over the array, or forgetting to check if the `nums` array is empty before iterating over it.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `k` is larger than all elements in `nums`, or where `nums` is empty.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a data structure with a higher time complexity than necessary, such as using a `std::list` instead of a `std::vector`.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with a variety of inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it's working correctly.
