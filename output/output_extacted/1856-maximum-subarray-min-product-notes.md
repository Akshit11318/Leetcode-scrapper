## Maximum Subarray Min Product
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray-min-product/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray-min-product/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given an array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: Return the maximum value of the minimum product of any subarray of `nums` that contains at least one negative number.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where there are no negative numbers or where the array is empty.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = [1, 2, 3, 0, -4, -5]`, the maximum value of the minimum product is `-5`.
  - For `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function should return `0` because there are no negative numbers.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the maximum value of the minimum product of any subarray that contains at least one negative number, we can start by checking every possible subarray.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subarrays.
  2. For each subarray, check if it contains at least one negative number.
  3. If it does, calculate the product of all numbers in the subarray and keep track of the minimum product for this subarray.
  4. Update the maximum minimum product found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward to think about checking all possible subarrays, as it guarantees finding the correct answer.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int maxMinProduct(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxMinProduct = INT_MIN;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            bool hasNegative = false;
            long long product = 1;
            for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                product *= nums[k];
                if (nums[k] < 0) {
                    hasNegative = true;
                }
            }
            if (hasNegative) {
                maxMinProduct = std::max(maxMinProduct, product);
            }
        }
    }
    if (maxMinProduct == INT_MIN) {
        return 0;
    }
    return maxMinProduct;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we generate all possible subarrays ($O(n^2)$), and for each subarray, we calculate the product ($O(n)$).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not including the space needed for the input array, as we only use a constant amount of space to store variables like `maxMinProduct` and `product`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops to generate all possible subarrays and then another loop to calculate the product of each subarray, leading to high time complexity. The space complexity is low because we only use a fixed amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of checking all possible subarrays, we can utilize the property of the minimum product. The minimum product of a subarray is determined by the smallest number (or the most negative number if considering the impact of negative numbers) in that subarray. Additionally, we can take advantage of the fact that the product of a subarray is negative if and only if the subarray contains an odd number of negative numbers.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum minimum product and the current minimum product.
  2. Iterate through the array, maintaining the current minimum product. When encountering a negative number, update the maximum minimum product if necessary.
  3. When encountering a zero, reset the current minimum product because a zero in the subarray makes the product zero, which is the smallest possible product.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the array, reducing the time complexity significantly compared to the brute force approach.

```cpp
int maxMinProduct(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    long long maxMinProduct = LLONG_MIN;
    long long currentProduct = 1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        currentProduct *= nums[i];
        if (currentProduct < 0) {
            maxMinProduct = std::max(maxMinProduct, currentProduct);
        }
        if (nums[i] == 0) {
            currentProduct = 1;
        }
    }
    if (maxMinProduct == LLONG_MIN) {
        return 0;
    }
    return maxMinProduct;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store variables like `maxMinProduct` and `currentProduct`.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach reduces the time complexity from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n)$ by only considering the impact of negative numbers and utilizing the property of the product operation, making it the most efficient solution.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Utilizing the properties of operations (in this case, multiplication) to simplify the problem, and considering the impact of specific elements (negative numbers) on the outcome.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Looking for ways to reduce the number of operations or the size of the input by exploiting properties of the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Simplifying the problem by focusing on key elements (negative numbers) and using a single pass through the data.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding maximum or minimum values based on specific conditions, such as maximum subarray sum.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases properly (e.g., empty array, no negative numbers).
- Edge cases to watch for: Zeroes in the array, which can reset the product, and the absence of negative numbers, which affects the outcome.
- Performance pitfalls: Using brute force approaches for problems that have more efficient solutions based on the properties of the operations involved.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with arrays containing negative numbers, zeroes, and positive numbers, as well as edge cases like empty arrays or arrays with no negative numbers.
