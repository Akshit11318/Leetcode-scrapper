## Minimum Sum of Squared Difference
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-sum-of-squared-difference/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-sum-of-squared-difference/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of integers, each of length `n`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq nums1[i], nums2[i] \leq 10^6$.
- Expected output format: The minimum sum of squared differences between `nums1` and `nums2`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input arrays may contain duplicate elements, and the minimum sum of squared differences should be calculated after sorting both arrays.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `nums1 = [1, 7, 5]` and `nums2 = [2, 3, 5]`, the output should be $(1-2)^2 + (5-3)^2 + (7-5)^2 = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9$.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The problem asks for the minimum sum of squared differences between two arrays after sorting them. A straightforward approach would be to sort both arrays and then calculate the sum of squared differences between corresponding elements.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Sort both input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
  2. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of squared differences.
  3. Iterate through both sorted arrays simultaneously, calculating the squared difference between corresponding elements and adding it to `sum`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by sorting the arrays and then calculating the sum of squared differences.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int minSumSquareDiff(int* nums1, int nums1Size, int* nums2, int nums2Size) {
    std::sort(nums1, nums1 + nums1Size);
    std::sort(nums2, nums2 + nums2Size);
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1Size; i++) {
        sum += (long long)std::abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]) * std::abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input arrays, due to the sorting operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, assuming the input arrays can be modified in-place, or $O(n)$ if additional space is needed for sorting.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation, and the space complexity depends on whether the sorting algorithm used requires additional space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved optimally by sorting both arrays and then calculating the sum of squared differences between corresponding elements. This is because sorting ensures that the smallest differences are paired together, minimizing the sum of squared differences.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort both input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
  2. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of squared differences.
  3. Iterate through both sorted arrays simultaneously, calculating the squared difference between corresponding elements and adding it to `sum`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures that the smallest differences are paired together, minimizing the sum of squared differences.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int minSumSquareDiff(int* nums1, int nums1Size, int* nums2, int nums2Size) {
    std::sort(nums1, nums1 + nums1Size);
    std::sort(nums2, nums2 + nums2Size);
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1Size; i++) {
        sum += (long long)std::abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]) * std::abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
    }
    return sum;
}
```
