## Special Permutations
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/special-permutations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem requires finding the number of special permutations of the numbers from 1 to n, where a permutation is considered special if it satisfies the condition that the absolute difference between any two adjacent elements is less than or equal to `k`. The input is an integer `n` and an integer `k`.
- Expected output format: The problem requires finding the total count of such special permutations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The solution must handle cases where `n` and `k` are within the given constraints.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the special permutations are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 1, 3]`, `[3, 1, 2]`, `[3, 2, 1]`, `[1, 3, 2]`, and `[2, 3, 1]`, so the output should be `6`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to generate all permutations of the numbers from 1 to `n` and check each permutation to see if it satisfies the given condition.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Generate all permutations of the numbers from 1 to `n`.
  2. For each permutation, check if the absolute difference between any two adjacent elements is less than or equal to `k`.
  3. If the permutation satisfies the condition, increment the count of special permutations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it is not efficient for large values of `n` because it generates all permutations, which has a time complexity of $O(n!)$.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void generatePermutations(std::vector<int>& nums, int start, int end, int k, int& count) {
    if (start == end) {
        bool isValid = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) > k) {
                isValid = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isValid) {
            count++;
        }
    } else {
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            std::swap(nums[start], nums[i]);
            generatePermutations(nums, start + 1, end, k, count);
            std::swap(nums[start], nums[i]);
        }
    }
}

int specialPermutations(int n, int k) {
    std::vector<int> nums(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        nums[i] = i + 1;
    }
    int count = 0;
    generatePermutations(nums, 0, n - 1, k, count);
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because there are $n!$ permutations of the numbers from 1 to $n$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because the recursive call stack can go up to a depth of $n$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because the brute force approach generates all permutations, and the space complexity is moderate because of the recursive call stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to build up a table where each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the number of special permutations of the numbers from 1 to `i` that end with `j`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize a table `dp` of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0.
  2. For each number `i` from 1 to `n`, iterate over all numbers `j` from 1 to `i`.
  3. For each `j`, calculate the number of special permutations of the numbers from 1 to `i` that end with `j` by summing up the number of special permutations of the numbers from 1 to `i - 1` that end with a number `k` such that `abs(k - j) <= k`.
  4. Store the result in `dp[i][j]`.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it avoids generating all permutations and instead builds up the solution iteratively.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int specialPermutations(int n, int k) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            if (i == 1) {
                dp[i][j] = 1;
            } else {
                for (int p = 1; p <= i - 1; p++) {
                    if (abs(p - j) <= k) {
                        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][p];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    int count = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        count += dp[n][j];
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because there are three nested loops.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because of the table `dp`.
> - **Optimality proof:** The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it avoids generating all permutations and instead builds up the solution iteratively.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: dynamic programming, permutation generation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: building up a solution iteratively, avoiding brute force approaches.
- Optimization techniques learned: using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
- Similar problems to practice: other permutation-related problems, dynamic programming problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: incorrect initialization of the table `dp`, incorrect calculation of the number of special permutations.
- Edge cases to watch for: cases where `n` or `k` is 0 or negative.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach for large values of `n`.
- Testing considerations: testing the solution with different values of `n` and `k`, testing the solution with edge cases.
