## Find Circular Gift Exchange Chains

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-circular-gift-exchange-chains/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer `n` and two arrays `forward` and `backward` of size `n`, representing the forward and backward edges in the graph.
- Constraints: `2 <= n <= 1000`, `0 <= forward[i] <= n-1`, `0 <= backward[i] <= n-1`.
- Expected output format: The number of circular gift exchange chains.
- Key requirements: Find the number of circular gift exchange chains in the graph, where a circular chain is a path that starts and ends at the same node.
- Example test cases:
  - `n = 3`, `forward = [1,2,0]`, `backward = [0,0,0]`. Output: `3`.
  - `n = 4`, `forward = [1,2,3,0]`, `backward = [0,0,0,0]`. Output: `4`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible paths in the graph and check if they form a circular chain.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a visited array to keep track of visited nodes.
  2. Perform DFS from each node to generate all possible paths.
  3. Check if each path forms a circular chain by verifying if the last node is the same as the first node.
  4. Count the number of circular chains found.

```cpp
int findCircularGiftExchangeChains(int n, vector<int>& forward, vector<int>& backward) {
    int count = 0;
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        visited[i] = true;
        vector<int> path = {i};
        dfs(i, forward, backward, visited, path, count);
        visited[i] = false;
    }
    
    return count;
}

void dfs(int node, vector<int>& forward, vector<int>& backward, vector<bool>& visited, vector<int>& path, int& count) {
    if (visited[forward[node]]) {
        if (forward[node] == path[0]) {
            count++;
        }
        return;
    }
    
    visited[forward[node]] = true;
    path.push_back(forward[node]);
    dfs(forward[node], forward, backward, visited, path, count);
    path.pop_back();
    visited[forward[node]] = false;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because we are generating all possible paths in the graph using DFS.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because we are using a visited array and a path vector to keep track of visited nodes and the current path.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity because it generates all possible paths in the graph, which can be exponential in the number of nodes. The space complexity is linear because we are using a visited array and a path vector to keep track of visited nodes and the current path.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of generating all possible paths, we can use a Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and the hare" algorithm) to detect cycles in the graph.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a slow and fast pointer to the first node.
  2. Move the slow pointer one step at a time and the fast pointer two steps at a time.
  3. If the fast pointer catches up to the slow pointer, it means there is a cycle in the graph.
  4. Count the number of nodes in the cycle.
  5. Repeat the process for each node in the graph.

```cpp
int findCircularGiftExchangeChains(int n, vector<int>& forward, vector<int>& backward) {
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int slow = i;
        int fast = i;
        
        do {
            slow = forward[slow];
            fast = forward[forward[fast]];
        } while (slow != fast);
        
        if (slow == i) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because we are using Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm to detect cycles in the graph.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because we are using a constant amount of space to store the slow and fast pointers.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach is more efficient than the brute force approach because it uses a cycle-finding algorithm to detect cycles in the graph, which reduces the time complexity from exponential to quadratic.
