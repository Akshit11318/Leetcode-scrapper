## Maximum Frequency of an Element after Performing Operations II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-of-an-element-after-performing-operations-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A list of integers `nums` and two integers `k` and `f`.
- Expected output: The maximum frequency of an element in `nums` after performing operations.
- Key requirements: Perform operations on `nums` such that we can either increment or decrement an element by 1 to match `f`.
- Example test cases:
  - `nums = [1,2,4], k = 5, f = 3`, the maximum frequency of an element after performing operations is 3.
  - `nums = [1,2,4], k = 5, f = 1`, the maximum frequency of an element after performing operations is 3.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of incrementing or decrementing elements to match `f`.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate through each element in `nums`.
  2. For each element, try incrementing or decrementing it by 1 until it matches `f` or we run out of operations (`k`).
  3. Keep track of the frequency of each element after performing operations.
  4. Return the maximum frequency found.

```cpp
int maxFrequency(vector<int>& nums, int k, int f) {
    int n = nums.size();
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    int max_freq = 0;
    
    // Generate all possible combinations of incrementing or decrementing elements
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        unordered_map<int, int> curr_freq;
        int ops = k;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                // Increment element
                if (nums[i] + 1 > f) continue;
                if (ops < f - nums[i] - 1) continue;
                ops -= f - nums[i] - 1;
                curr_freq[f]++;
            } else {
                // Decrement element
                if (nums[i] - 1 < f) continue;
                if (ops < nums[i] - f - 1) continue;
                ops -= nums[i] - f - 1;
                curr_freq[f]++;
            }
        }
        
        // Update max frequency
        for (auto& pair : curr_freq) {
            max_freq = max(max_freq, pair.second);
        }
    }
    
    return max_freq;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the size of `nums`. This is because we generate all possible combinations of incrementing or decrementing elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of `nums`. This is because we use an unordered map to store the frequency of each element.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations of incrementing or decrementing elements, resulting in exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we use an unordered map to store the frequency of each element.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of trying all possible combinations, we can use a sliding window approach to find the maximum frequency.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Sort `nums` in ascending order.
  2. Initialize a sliding window with the first element of `nums`.
  3. Expand the sliding window to the right by incrementing the right pointer.
  4. For each element in the sliding window, calculate the number of operations required to make it equal to `f`.
  5. If the total number of operations exceeds `k`, shrink the sliding window from the left.
  6. Update the maximum frequency.

```cpp
int maxFrequency(vector<int>& nums, int k, int f) {
    int n = nums.size();
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int max_freq = 0;
    int left = 0;
    long long ops = 0;
    
    for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        ops += abs(nums[right] - f);
        
        while (ops > k) {
            ops -= abs(nums[left] - f);
            left++;
        }
        
        max_freq = max(max_freq, right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return max_freq;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the size of `nums`. This is because we sort `nums` in ascending order.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space required for sorting. This is because we use a constant amount of space to store the sliding window and the maximum frequency.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach uses a sliding window to find the maximum frequency, which is more efficient than trying all possible combinations. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, and the space complexity is constant.
