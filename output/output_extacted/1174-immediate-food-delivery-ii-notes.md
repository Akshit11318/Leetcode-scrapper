## Immediate Food Delivery II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/immediate-food-delivery-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves delivering food to customers in the shortest possible time. The input consists of `n` orders, each with a delivery time `deliveryTime`, and `n` customers, each with a preferred delivery time `preferredTime`. The goal is to find the minimum possible time to deliver all orders.
- Expected output format: The output should be the minimum possible time to deliver all orders.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The key requirement is to minimize the total delivery time while satisfying the preferred delivery times of all customers. Edge cases include when the number of orders is equal to the number of customers, when the delivery times are equal to the preferred times, and when there are duplicate delivery or preferred times.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `n = 3`, `deliveryTime = [1,2,3]`, and `preferredTime = [3,2,1]`, the minimum possible time to deliver all orders is 4.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to try all possible permutations of orders and customers to find the minimum possible time to deliver all orders.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: The brute force approach involves generating all possible permutations of orders and customers, calculating the total delivery time for each permutation, and returning the minimum time found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and ensures that all possible solutions are considered.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minTime(vector<int>& deliveryTime, vector<int>& preferredTime) {
    int n = deliveryTime.size();
    int minTime = INT_MAX;
    do {
        int time = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            time = max(time, preferredTime[i]) + deliveryTime[i];
        }
        minTime = min(minTime, time);
    } while (next_permutation(preferredTime.begin(), preferredTime.end()));
    return minTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$, where $n$ is the number of orders. This is because there are $n!$ possible permutations of orders and customers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space required for the input vectors. This is because the space usage does not grow with the size of the input.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because the brute force approach tries all possible permutations, resulting in exponential time complexity. The space complexity is low because the approach only uses a constant amount of space to store the minimum time found.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a greedy approach to assign orders to customers. Specifically, we can sort the orders by delivery time and the customers by preferred time, and then assign the order with the earliest delivery time to the customer with the earliest preferred time.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach involves sorting the orders and customers, and then iterating through the sorted lists to assign orders to customers.
- Proof of optimality: The optimality of this approach can be proven by showing that any other assignment would result in a longer total delivery time.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the total delivery time by assigning the order with the earliest delivery time to the customer with the earliest preferred time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minTime(vector<int>& deliveryTime, vector<int>& preferredTime) {
    int n = deliveryTime.size();
    vector<pair<int, int>> orders;
    vector<pair<int, int>> customers;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        orders.push_back({deliveryTime[i], i});
        customers.push_back({preferredTime[i], i});
    }
    sort(orders.begin(), orders.end());
    sort(customers.begin(), customers.end());
    int time = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        time = max(time, customers[i].first) + orders[i].first;
    }
    return time;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of orders. This is because the approach involves sorting the orders and customers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of orders. This is because the approach uses additional space to store the sorted lists of orders and customers.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimality of this approach can be proven by showing that any other assignment would result in a longer total delivery time. This is because the approach assigns the order with the earliest delivery time to the customer with the earliest preferred time, minimizing the total delivery time.
