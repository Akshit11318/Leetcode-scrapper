## Divisor Game
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `N` representing the initial number of stones.
- Output: `true` if the first player can win the game, `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements: The game involves two players, with the first player trying to win by making moves that leave the second player with a losing position. A move consists of choosing a divisor `x` of `N` and replacing `N` with `N - x`.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `N = 2`, Output: `true`
  - Input: `N = 3`, Output: `false`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves simulating the game for all possible moves and their outcomes.
- We start with the given number `N` and try all its divisors as potential moves.
- For each move, we recursively simulate the game with the updated number `N - x`, where `x` is the chosen divisor.
- We check if the current player can win by trying all possible moves and seeing if any of them lead to a winning position for the next player.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool divisorGame(int N) {
        vector<bool> dp(N + 1, false);
        for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
            for (int x = 1; x < i; x++) {
                if (i % x == 0 && !dp[i - x]) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[N];
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the input number. This is because for each number up to $N$, we potentially check all its divisors.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$, as we use a vector of size $N + 1$ to store the winning status for each number.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is quadratic because we have a nested loop structure, where the outer loop runs up to $N$, and the inner loop also potentially runs up to $N$ (in the worst case, when checking all divisors). The space complexity is linear because we store the results for each number up to $N$.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is recognizing that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number `N`.
- If `N` is even, the first player can always make a move that leaves the second player with an odd number, forcing the second player into a losing position.
- If `N` is odd, the first player cannot make a move that leaves the second player with an even number, as all divisors of an odd number are odd, leading to an odd number after subtraction.
- This observation simplifies the solution significantly, as we only need to check the parity of `N`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool divisorGame(int N) {
        return N % 2 == 0;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only perform a constant-time operation to check the parity of `N`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we do not use any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it directly addresses the problem's core, which is the parity of the input number `N`. No further optimization is possible as we have reduced the problem to a single, constant-time operation.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of recognizing patterns and simplifying problems to their core.
- Understanding how the parity of a number can affect the outcome of a game.
- The value of reducing complex problems to simple, constant-time operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Overcomplicating the solution by not recognizing the underlying pattern or simplification.
- Failing to consider the implications of the input's parity on the game's outcome.
- Not optimizing the solution to its simplest form, leading to unnecessary complexity.
