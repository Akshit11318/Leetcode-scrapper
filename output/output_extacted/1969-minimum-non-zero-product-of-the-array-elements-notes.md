## Minimum Non-Zero Product of the Array Elements

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-non-zero-product-of-the-array-elements/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `pmax` (the maximum possible value of the array elements), `seed` (the seed for the random number generator), and `mod` (the modulo value).
- Output: The minimum non-zero product of the array elements, modulo `mod`.
- Key requirements:
  - The product should be non-zero.
  - The product should be minimized.
  - The result should be modulo `mod`.
- Example test cases:
  - `pmax = 2`, `seed = 1`, `mod = 1000` => Output: `2`
  - `pmax = 3`, `seed = 2`, `mod = 1000` => Output: `3`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of numbers from `1` to `pmax` and calculate their products.
- We then check if the product is non-zero and keep track of the minimum product found.
- This approach comes to mind first because it is a straightforward way to solve the problem, but it is not efficient for large values of `pmax`.

```cpp
long long minNonZeroProduct(int pmax, int seed, int mod) {
    long long minProduct = LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = 1; i <= pmax; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j <= pmax; j++) {
            long long product = (long long)i * j;
            if (product != 0 && product < minProduct) {
                minProduct = product;
            }
        }
    }
    return minProduct % mod;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(pmax^2)$, where `pmax` is the maximum possible value of the array elements. This is because we are using two nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of numbers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the minimum product.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are trying all possible combinations of numbers, and the space complexity is low because we are only storing a single variable.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is that the minimum non-zero product is always `1` or the smallest prime number less than or equal to `pmax`.
- If `pmax` is `1`, the minimum non-zero product is `1`.
- If `pmax` is greater than `1`, the minimum non-zero product is `2`.
- We can prove that this is the optimal solution because any product greater than `2` will always be greater than `2`, and any product less than `2` will be `1` or `0`.

```cpp
long long minNonZeroProduct(int pmax, int seed, int mod) {
    if (pmax == 1) {
        return 1 % mod;
    } else {
        return 2 % mod;
    }
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are only checking a single condition and returning a constant value.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we are always returning the smallest possible non-zero product, and any other solution would require more operations or space.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The key algorithmic concept demonstrated is the importance of understanding the problem constraints and finding the simplest solution.
- The problem-solving pattern identified is the use of mathematical insights to simplify the problem.
- The optimization technique learned is the use of constant-time operations to reduce the time complexity.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- A common implementation error is to use a brute force approach without considering the problem constraints.
- An edge case to watch for is when `pmax` is `1`, because the minimum non-zero product is `1` in this case.
- A performance pitfall is to use a solution with high time complexity, because it will not scale well for large inputs.
