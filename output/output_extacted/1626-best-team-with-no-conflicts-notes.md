## Best Team With No Conflicts
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/best-team-with-no-conflicts/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array `scores` of integers representing the scores of each player and an array `ages` of integers representing the ages of each player.
- Constraints: The length of `scores` and `ages` will be the same, and each element will be between 1 and 1000.
- Expected output format: The maximum total score of all players in a team that can be formed with no conflicts, where a conflict occurs if a younger player has a higher or equal score than an older player.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handle cases where the input arrays are empty or have only one element.
  - Consider scenarios where multiple players have the same score or age.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `scores = [4,5,6,5]`, `ages = [2,1,2,1]`, the maximum total score of all players in a team with no conflicts is `16`.
- `scores = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`, `ages = [6,5,4,3,2,1]`, the maximum total score of all players in a team with no conflicts is `21`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to generate all possible teams and check each one for conflicts.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of players.
  2. For each subset, check if there are any conflicts (a younger player with a higher or equal score than an older player).
  3. If there are no conflicts, calculate the total score of the team.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to ensure we consider all possible teams.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int bestTeamScore(std::vector<int>& scores, std::vector<int>& ages) {
    int n = scores.size();
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> players;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        players.push_back({ages[i], scores[i]});
    }
    std::sort(players.begin(), players.end());

    int maxScore = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
        bool conflict = false;
        int score = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                    if ((mask & (1 << j)) != 0 && players[j].first < players[i].first && players[j].second >= players[i].second) {
                        conflict = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (conflict) break;
                score += players[i].second;
            }
        }
        if (!conflict) maxScore = std::max(maxScore, score);
    }
    return maxScore;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of players. This is because we generate all possible subsets of players and for each subset, we check for conflicts in $O(n^2)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the players and the current subset.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inefficient due to the exponential number of subsets and the quadratic time spent checking each subset for conflicts.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can use dynamic programming to store the maximum score for each possible subset of players that can be formed without conflicts.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Sort the players by age and then by score.
  2. Initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum score that can be achieved using the first `i` players without conflicts.
  3. For each player, iterate over all previous players and update `dp[i]` if including the current player does not create a conflict.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach considers all possible teams without conflicts in a single pass, achieving the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
int bestTeamScore(std::vector<int>& scores, std::vector<int>& ages) {
    int n = scores.size();
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> players;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        players.push_back({ages[i], scores[i]});
    }
    std::sort(players.begin(), players.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
        return a.first == b.first ? a.second <= b.second : a.first < b.first;
    });

    std::vector<int> dp(n);
    int maxScore = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = players[i].second;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (players[j].second <= players[i].second) {
                dp[i] = std::max(dp[i], dp[j] + players[i].second);
            }
        }
        maxScore = std::max(maxScore, dp[i]);
    }
    return maxScore;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of players. This is because we iterate over the players and for each player, we potentially iterate over all previous players.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for the dynamic programming table and the sorted players.
