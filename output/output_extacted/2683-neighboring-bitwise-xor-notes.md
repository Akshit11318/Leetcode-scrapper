## Neighboring Bitwise XOR
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/neighboring-bitwise-xor/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an integer `n`, representing the number of elements in the array. Each element in the array is a non-negative integer.
- Expected output format: The output should be an integer representing the maximum possible bitwise XOR of all elements in the array.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array should be filled with numbers from 0 to `n-1` such that the bitwise XOR of all neighboring elements is maximized.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `n = 2`, the maximum XOR is achieved with the array `[0, 1]`, resulting in a XOR of `1`.
  - For `n = 3`, the maximum XOR is achieved with the array `[0, 2, 1]`, resulting in a XOR of `3`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves generating all possible permutations of numbers from 0 to `n-1` and calculating the bitwise XOR of all neighboring elements for each permutation.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
  2. For each permutation, calculate the bitwise XOR of all neighboring elements.
  3. Keep track of the maximum XOR found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that involves checking all possible arrangements of numbers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int max_xor(vector<int>& nums) {
    int max_xor = 0;
    do {
        int xor_val = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            xor_val ^= (nums[i] ^ nums[i+1]);
        }
        max_xor = max(max_xor, xor_val);
    } while (next_permutation(nums.begin(), nums.end()));
    return max_xor;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> nums(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        nums[i] = i;
    }
    cout << max_xor(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n! \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. The reason for this complexity is that we are generating all permutations of the array, which takes $O(n!)$ time. For each permutation, we are calculating the bitwise XOR of all neighboring elements, which takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. The reason for this complexity is that we need to store the current permutation, which takes $O(n)$ space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible permutations of the array, which leads to a high time complexity. The space complexity is relatively low because we only need to store the current permutation.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves observing that the bitwise XOR of all neighboring elements can be maximized by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Start with an empty array.
  2. Alternate between adding the smallest and largest remaining numbers to the array.
  3. Continue this process until all numbers have been added to the array.
- Proof of optimality: The optimality of this approach can be proven by showing that any other arrangement of numbers will result in a lower bitwise XOR of neighboring elements.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The optimal approach already achieves the maximum possible bitwise XOR of neighboring elements, so further optimization is not possible.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int max_xor(int n) {
    vector<int> nums(n);
    int small = 0;
    int large = n - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            nums[i] = small++;
        } else {
            nums[i] = large--;
        }
    }
    int xor_val = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        xor_val ^= (nums[i] ^ nums[i+1]);
    }
    return xor_val;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << max_xor(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. The reason for this complexity is that we are iterating over the array once to construct the optimal arrangement of numbers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. The reason for this complexity is that we need to store the optimal arrangement of numbers, which takes $O(n)$ space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimality of this approach can be proven by showing that any other arrangement of numbers will result in a lower bitwise XOR of neighboring elements.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem demonstrates the importance of observing patterns and using greedy algorithms to solve optimization problems.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem involves identifying a pattern in the optimal arrangement of numbers and using this pattern to construct a solution.

- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve constructing optimal arrangements of numbers, such as the "Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons" problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: One common implementation error is to use a brute force approach instead of a greedy algorithm, which can result in a high time complexity.
- Edge cases to watch for: One edge case to watch for is when the input array is empty, in which case the function should return 0.
- Performance pitfalls: One performance pitfall is to use a brute force approach instead of a greedy algorithm, which can result in a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: The function should be tested with a variety of input arrays, including empty arrays and arrays with a large number of elements.
