## Count the Number of K-Free Subsets
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-k-free-subsets/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: `nums` - an array of integers, and `k` - an integer.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`, `1 <= k <= 1000`.
- Expected output format: The number of k-free subsets in the given array.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: A k-free subset is a subset that does not contain any pair of elements that sum up to k.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Example 1: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 5`. Output: `6`. Explanation: The k-free subsets are `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`, `[]`, `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Example 2: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 6`. Output: `7`. Explanation: The k-free subsets are `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`, `[1, 2]`, `[1, 3]`, `[]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To generate all possible subsets of the given array and check if each subset is k-free.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of the given array using bit manipulation.
  2. For each subset, check if it is k-free by iterating over all pairs of elements and checking if their sum equals k.
  3. If a subset is k-free, increment the count.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countKFreeSubsets(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int count = 0;
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            bool isKFree = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    if ((mask & (1 << i)) && (mask & (1 << j)) && nums[i] + nums[j] == k) {
                        isKFree = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!isKFree) break;
            }
            if (isKFree) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we generate all possible subsets and for each subset, we check all pairs of elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and the mask.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we generate all possible subsets, which is exponential in the size of the input array. The space complexity is low because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to store the count of k-free subsets for each prefix of the input array.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the count of k-free subsets for the first `i` elements with the last element being `j`.
  2. For each element in the input array, iterate over all possible last elements and update `dp[i][j]` accordingly.
  3. The final answer is stored in `dp[n][0]`, where `n` is the size of the input array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countKFreeSubsets(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(2, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1];
            dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][0];
            if (nums[i - 1] * 2 == k) {
                dp[i][1] = 0;
            } else if (k % 2 == 0 && nums[i - 1] == k / 2) {
                dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][1];
            } else {
                dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][1];
            }
        }
        return dp[n][0] + dp[n][1];
    }
};
```

However the above code will not work correctly as we need to track the numbers that are already in the subset.

A correct approach is to use a map to store the dp values.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countKFreeSubsets(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        map<int, int> dp;
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int num : nums) {
            map<int, int> newDp;
            for (auto& [mask, count] : dp) {
                newDp[mask] += count;
                int newMask = mask;
                bool valid = true;
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    if ((mask & (1 << i)) && (i + num == k)) {
                        valid = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (valid) {
                    newDp[newMask | (1 << num)] += count;
                }
            }
            dp = newDp;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (auto& [mask, count] : dp) {
            ans += count;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, bit manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using dp to store the count of k-free subsets for each prefix of the input array.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity from exponential to polynomial using dynamic programming.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling the edge cases correctly, not initializing the dp array correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: When the input array is empty, when k is 0.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a naive approach that generates all possible subsets, which has a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input arrays and values of k, testing the edge cases.
