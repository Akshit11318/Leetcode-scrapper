## Game Play Analysis IV
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-iv/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves analyzing game play data from two tables, `Activity` and `Games`. The `Activity` table contains information about player activities, including the player ID, game ID, event date, and team ID. The `Games` table contains game information, including the game ID and the install date. The goal is to find the fraction of players that logged in on the day they installed the game.
- Expected output format: The result should be a single decimal value representing the fraction of players who logged in on the day they installed the game.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The solution must handle cases where a player installs a game but does not log in on the same day, as well as cases where a player logs in on multiple days.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If a player installs a game and logs in on the same day, they should be counted in the numerator of the fraction.
  - If a player installs a game but does not log in on the same day, they should not be counted in the numerator.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating over each row in the `Activity` table and checking if the event date matches the install date of the corresponding game in the `Games` table.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each row in the `Activity` table.
  2. For each row, find the corresponding game in the `Games` table.
  3. Check if the event date matches the install date of the game.
  4. If the dates match, increment a counter to keep track of the number of players who logged in on the day they installed the game.
  5. After iterating over all rows, calculate the fraction of players who logged in on the day they installed the game by dividing the counter by the total number of unique players.

```cpp
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN a.event_date = g.install_date THEN a.player_id END) / 
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id) AS fraction
FROM 
  Activity a
JOIN 
  Games g ON a.game_id = g.game_id
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Activity` table, because we are iterating over each row once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we are storing the results of the join operation in memory.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are performing a single pass over the data, and the space complexity is linear because we are storing the results of the join operation.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using a single SQL query to perform the join operation and calculate the fraction of players who logged in on the day they installed the game.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Perform a join operation between the `Activity` and `Games` tables on the `game_id` column.
  2. Use a `CASE` statement to check if the event date matches the install date of the game.
  3. Use the `COUNT(DISTINCT)` function to count the number of unique players who logged in on the day they installed the game.
  4. Divide the count by the total number of unique players to calculate the fraction.

```cpp
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN a.event_date = g.install_date THEN a.player_id END) / 
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id) AS fraction
FROM 
  Activity a
JOIN 
  Games g ON a.game_id = g.game_id
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Activity` table, because we are performing a single pass over the data.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we are storing the results of the join operation in memory.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it performs the minimum number of operations necessary to calculate the fraction of players who logged in on the day they installed the game.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Join operations, `CASE` statements, and aggregate functions.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a single SQL query to perform complex operations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minimizing the number of operations necessary to calculate the desired result.
- Similar problems to practice: Other SQL problems involving join operations and aggregate functions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to use the `DISTINCT` keyword when counting unique players.
- Edge cases to watch for: Players who install a game but do not log in on the same day.
- Performance pitfalls: Performing unnecessary operations or using inefficient algorithms.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input data to ensure correctness.
