## Strong Password Checker II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/strong-password-checker-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A string `password` representing the password to be checked.
- Constraints: The password length is between 1 and 50 characters.
- Expected output format: A boolean indicating whether the password is strong or not.
- Key requirements: A strong password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
- Edge cases to consider: Handling passwords with varying lengths and compositions.

**Example Test Cases:**
- "IloveLe3tcode!" should return true because it meets all the requirements.
- "Me+You--IsMyDream" should return false because it does not contain a digit.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check each character in the password to ensure it meets the requirements.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Check the length of the password to ensure it's at least 8 characters long.
  2. Initialize flags to track the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
  3. Iterate through each character in the password, updating the flags as necessary.
  4. After checking all characters, verify that all flags are set to true.

```cpp
bool strongPasswordCheckerII(string password) {
    // Check length
    if (password.length() < 8) return false;

    bool hasLower = false, hasUpper = false, hasDigit = false, hasSpecial = false;
    for (char c : password) {
        if (islower(c)) hasLower = true;
        else if (isupper(c)) hasUpper = true;
        else if (isdigit(c)) hasDigit = true;
        else hasSpecial = true;
    }

    return hasLower && hasUpper && hasDigit && hasSpecial;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the password. This is because we're potentially checking each character in the password once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're using a constant amount of space to store the flags.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The linear time complexity is due to the single pass through the password string. The constant space complexity is because we're using a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The brute force approach is already optimal because we must check each character at least once to verify the password's strength.
- Detailed breakdown: The same as the brute force approach, as no further optimization is possible without sacrificing correctness.
- Proof of optimality: Any algorithm must check each character at least once, leading to a minimum time complexity of $O(n)$.

```cpp
bool strongPasswordCheckerII(string password) {
    if (password.length() < 8) return false;

    bool hasLower = false, hasUpper = false, hasDigit = false, hasSpecial = false;
    for (char c : password) {
        if (islower(c)) hasLower = true;
        else if (isupper(c)) hasUpper = true;
        else if (isdigit(c)) hasDigit = true;
        else hasSpecial = true;
    }

    return hasLower && hasUpper && hasDigit && hasSpecial;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the password.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most efficient solution because it checks each character exactly once, which is necessary to determine if the password is strong.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of checking each character in a string when verifying its properties.
- Understanding that sometimes, the brute force approach is optimal due to the nature of the problem.
- Recognizing that $O(n)$ time complexity is unavoidable when every element in the input must be examined.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not checking the length of the password before proceeding with other checks.
- Failing to initialize flags or update them correctly during iteration.
- Not verifying that all conditions (lowercase, uppercase, digit, special character) are met before returning true.

**Similar Problems to Practice:**
- Other string validation problems that require checking for specific patterns or properties.
- Problems involving flags or boolean variables to track conditions.
- Algorithms that require a single pass through the input data to achieve optimal performance.
