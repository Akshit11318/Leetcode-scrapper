## Non-overlapping Intervals
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `m x n` grid, where each cell can have a value of 0 or 1, indicating if an operation was performed on that cell.
- Input format and constraints: `m` and `n` are integers representing the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. `0 <= m, n <= 1000`.
- Expected output format: The maximum number of cells that can be covered by a square of size `s x s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `n`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The grid can be empty, or it can have all zeros or all ones. The square should be fully contained within the grid.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If the grid is `[[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]`, the maximum number of cells that can be covered by a square is 9.
  - If the grid is `[[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`, the maximum number of cells that can be covered by a square is 1.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can iterate through each cell in the grid and try to place a square of size `s x s` at that position.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each cell in the grid.
  2. For each cell, try to place a square of size `s x s` at that position.
  3. If the square is fully contained within the grid, count the number of cells in the square that have a value of 1.
  4. Keep track of the maximum number of cells that can be covered by a square.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible positions for the square.

```cpp
int maxCount(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& ops) {
    if (ops.empty()) return m * n;
    int minM = INT_MAX, minN = INT_MAX;
    for (auto& op : ops) {
        minM = min(minM, op[0]);
        minN = min(minN, op[1]);
    }
    return minM * minN;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we iterate through each operation once. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the minimum values of `m` and `n`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The maximum number of cells that can be covered by a square is equal to the minimum of `m` and `n`, where `m` and `n` are the minimum values of the row and column indices of the operations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize `minM` and `minN` to infinity.
  2. Iterate through each operation and update `minM` and `minN` to be the minimum of the current value and the row and column indices of the operation.
  3. Return the product of `minM` and `minN`.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum values of `m` and `n` and returns their product, which is the maximum number of cells that can be covered by a square.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This solution has a time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of operations, which is the minimum possible time complexity because we must iterate through each operation at least once.

```cpp
int maxCount(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& ops) {
    if (ops.empty()) return m * n;
    int minM = INT_MAX, minN = INT_MAX;
    for (auto& op : ops) {
        minM = min(minM, op[0]);
        minN = min(minN, op[1]);
    }
    return minM * minN;
}
```
