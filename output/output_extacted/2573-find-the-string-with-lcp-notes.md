## Find the String with LCP
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-string-with-lcp/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given a list of non-empty strings `strs`.
- Constraints: `1 <= strs.length <= 200`, `1 <= strs[i].length <= 200`.
- Expected output format: Return the longest common prefix of all the strings in `strs`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The input list `strs` may contain duplicate strings.
  - The input list `strs` may be empty, but according to the constraints, it's guaranteed to have at least one string.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]`, the output should be `"fl"`.
  - For `strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]`, the output should be `""`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Compare each character of the first string with the corresponding character of all other strings.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start with the first string in the list.
  2. Compare each character of the first string with the corresponding character of all other strings.
  3. If a mismatch is found, return the common prefix up to the mismatched character.
  4. If all characters match, return the entire first string as the common prefix.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to compare strings character by character.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findTheString(vector<string>& strs) {
        if (strs.empty()) {
            return "";
        }
        
        string result = strs[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < strs.size(); ++i) {
            int j = 0;
            while (j < result.size() && j < strs[i].size() && result[j] == strs[i][j]) {
                ++j;
            }
            result = result.substr(0, j);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings and $m$ is the maximum length of a string. This is because we're comparing each character of each string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the maximum length of a string. This is because we're storing the common prefix.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we're comparing each character of each string. The space complexity occurs because we're storing the common prefix.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the same approach as the brute force solution, but with a slight modification to make it more efficient.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Start with the first string in the list.
  2. Compare each character of the first string with the corresponding character of all other strings.
  3. If a mismatch is found, return the common prefix up to the mismatched character.
  4. If all characters match, return the entire first string as the common prefix.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we need to compare each character of each string at least once to find the common prefix.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We can't optimize this approach further because we need to compare each character of each string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findTheString(vector<string>& strs) {
        if (strs.empty()) {
            return "";
        }
        
        string result = strs[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < strs.size(); ++i) {
            int j = 0;
            while (j < result.size() && j < strs[i].size() && result[j] == strs[i][j]) {
                ++j;
            }
            result = result.substr(0, j);
            if (result.empty()) {
                return "";
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: String comparison, prefix matching.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Comparing each character of each string to find the common prefix.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, as the optimal solution is already quite efficient.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string comparison problems, such as finding the longest common suffix.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for an empty input list, not handling the case where the common prefix is empty.
- Edge cases to watch for: An empty input list, a list with a single string, a list with multiple strings that have a common prefix.
- Performance pitfalls: Not optimizing the comparison process, which can lead to a slower solution.
- Testing considerations: Test the solution with different input cases, including an empty list, a list with a single string, and a list with multiple strings that have a common prefix.
