## Minimum Cost to Convert String II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-convert-string-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` and an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of converting the `i-th` character of `s` to any other lowercase letter.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`, `s` consists of lowercase letters, and `1 <= cost.length == s.length`.
- Expected Output: The minimum cost to convert all characters in `s` to make all characters the same.
- Key Requirements: Find the minimum cost to make all characters the same by converting characters in `s` using the provided costs.
- Edge Cases: Consider when `s` is empty or when all characters in `s` are already the same.
- Example Test Cases:
  - Input: `s = "abc", cost = [1,5,3]`
    - Output: `3`
    - Explanation: Convert 'a' and 'b' to 'c', which costs 1 + 2 = 3.
  - Input: `s = "aa", cost = [2,2]`
    - Output: `0`
    - Explanation: No conversion is needed.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through all possible characters that can be the target for conversion and calculate the cost of converting all characters to this target character.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate through all lowercase letters (26 letters).
  2. For each letter, calculate the total cost of converting all characters in `s` to this letter.
  3. Keep track of the minimum cost found across all letters.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to consider all possibilities.

```cpp
int minCost(string s, vector<int>& cost) {
    int minCost = INT_MAX;
    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
        int totalCost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (s[i] != c) {
                totalCost += cost[i];
            }
        }
        minCost = min(minCost, totalCost);
    }
    return minCost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(26 \times n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`. This is because we iterate through all characters in `s` for each of the 26 possible target characters.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space to store the minimum cost and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested iterations: one over all possible target characters and another over the characters in `s`, leading to a time complexity that is linear in the length of `s` but multiplied by the constant factor of 26. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of iterating over all possible target characters and then calculating the cost for each, we can directly calculate the cost for each character in `s` by considering the costs of converting it to any other character.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the minimum cost.
  2. Iterate through each character in `s`.
  3. For each character, calculate the cost of converting it to every other possible character.
  4. Update the minimum cost if a lower cost is found.
- Proof of optimality: This approach considers all possible conversions and directly calculates the minimum cost without redundant iterations.

```cpp
int minCost(string s, vector<int>& cost) {
    int minCost = INT_MAX;
    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
        int totalCost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (s[i] != c) {
                totalCost += cost[i];
            }
        }
        minCost = min(minCost, totalCost);
    }
    return minCost;
}
```

However, we can actually simplify and optimize this further by recognizing that we don't need to explicitly iterate over all characters and then over the string. The key insight is to understand that for each character in the string, we're considering the cost of converting it to every other character. But since we're looking for the minimum cost across all possible conversions to a single character, we can simplify our approach by focusing on the cost array and the string itself.

A more optimal approach involves recognizing that the minimum cost to convert all characters to the same character is essentially the sum of costs of characters that are not the most frequent character (since converting to the most frequent character would minimize the cost). However, the provided problem statement and the initial approach do not directly lead to this simplification without considering the frequency of characters and their costs.

Given the initial setup and aiming for clarity and progression, the provided code in the optimal section is essentially the same as the brute force due to the oversight in directly applying a more efficient algorithm based on character frequencies and costs. The optimal solution should indeed consider the frequency of characters and the associated costs to minimize the conversion cost.

To truly optimize, consider the following:
- Calculate the frequency of each character in `s`.
- For each unique character, calculate the total cost of converting all other characters to it.
- The minimum of these costs is the optimal solution.

```cpp
int minCost(string s, vector<int>& cost) {
    int n = s.size();
    int minCost = INT_MAX;
    unordered_map<char, int> charFrequency;
    for (char c : s) {
        charFrequency[c]++;
    }
    
    for (auto& pair : charFrequency) {
        char targetChar = pair.first;
        int totalCost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (s[i] != targetChar) {
                totalCost += cost[i];
            }
        }
        minCost = min(minCost, totalCost);
    }
    return minCost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the length of `s` and $m$ is the number of unique characters in `s`. This is because we first count the frequency of each character and then iterate over the unique characters to calculate the minimum cost.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, for storing the frequency of each character.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach considers all possible conversions to each unique character in `s` and directly calculates the minimum cost, making it more efficient than the brute force approach by reducing the number of iterations over the string.
