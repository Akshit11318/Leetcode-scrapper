## TreeNode
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-node/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem defines a `TreeNode` class with an integer `val`, and pointers to its left and right children.
- Expected output format: N/A, as this problem focuses on defining the structure of a tree node.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Understanding the basic structure of a binary tree and how nodes are connected.
- Example test cases with explanations: Creating a sample binary tree with `TreeNode` instances and traversing it to demonstrate node connections.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves directly implementing the `TreeNode` class as described in the problem statement.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Define a class named `TreeNode`.
  2. Include an integer `val` to store the node's value.
  3. Declare pointers to the left and right child nodes.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the problem's description, making it the most straightforward implementation.

```cpp
// TreeNode class definition
class TreeNode {
public:
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, since creating a node or accessing its members takes constant time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as each node occupies a fixed amount of space regardless of the tree size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The operations on a `TreeNode` are basic and do not depend on the size of the input (the tree), leading to constant time and space complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is essentially the same as the brute force approach because the problem only asks for the definition of a `TreeNode` class, which is inherently straightforward and optimal given the constraints.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The definition provided in the brute force section is already optimal as it directly implements the required structure without any unnecessary overhead.
- Proof of optimality: Since the task is to define a basic class structure, any implementation that includes the required members (`val`, `left`, `right`) and properly initializes them is optimal.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The definition of a `TreeNode` is fundamental and does not allow for further simplification without omitting necessary information.

```cpp
// Same as the brute force approach
class TreeNode {
public:
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, for the same reasons as the brute force approach.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as each node's size is constant and does not scale with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** The implementation is minimal and necessary, making it optimal by definition.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Basic class definition in C++ and understanding of binary tree structures.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct implementation of problem requirements.
- Optimization techniques learned: Recognizing when a problem's requirements are already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving basic data structures like linked lists or stacks.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to initialize pointers to `NULL` or not including necessary class members.
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring the class can handle the creation of multiple nodes and their connections correctly.
- Performance pitfalls: Overcomplicating the class definition with unnecessary members or methods.
- Testing considerations: Verifying that nodes can be created and connected as expected, and that their values can be accessed correctly.
