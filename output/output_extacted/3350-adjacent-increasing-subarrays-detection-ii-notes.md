## Adjacent Increasing Subarrays Detection II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/adjacent-increasing-subarrays-detection-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of integers `nums`, return a boolean array where each element at index `i` represents whether the subarray `nums[i - 1]` and `nums[i]` is strictly increasing.
- Expected output format: A boolean array.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The input array can be empty or have a single element.
  - The first element of the output array should be `false` since there's no preceding element to form a subarray.
  - For the rest of the elements, compare each element with its preceding one to determine if the subarray is strictly increasing.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output should be `[false, true, true, true]` because each subarray of two consecutive elements is strictly increasing.
  - For input `[1, 1, 2, 3]`, the output should be `[false, false, true, true]` because only the subarrays `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are strictly increasing.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To determine if each subarray of two consecutive elements is strictly increasing, we simply need to compare each element with its preceding one.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty boolean array `result` of the same length as the input array `nums`.
  2. For the first element of `result`, set it to `false` since there's no preceding element to compare with.
  3. For each element in `nums` starting from the second element (index 1), compare it with its preceding element.
  4. If the current element is greater than its preceding element, set the corresponding element in `result` to `true`, indicating the subarray is strictly increasing. Otherwise, set it to `false`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's the most straightforward way to solve the problem by directly comparing each pair of consecutive elements.

```cpp
vector<bool> detectCapitalUse(string word) {
    int n = word.size();
    vector<bool> result(n, false);
    
    // The first element is always false
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (word[i] > word[i - 1]) {
            result[i] = true;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array, because we are iterating through the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we are creating a boolean array of the same length as the input array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a constant amount of work for each element in the array. The space complexity is also linear because we need to store the result for each element.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved in a single pass through the array, and there's no need for additional data structures beyond the output array.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the output array with the first element as `false`.
  2. Iterate through the input array starting from the second element, comparing each element with its predecessor.
  3. Update the output array accordingly based on the comparison.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the input array and uses a minimal amount of extra space (for the output array), which is unavoidable given the nature of the problem.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Any solution must at least read the input array once and produce an output array of the same length, so the time and space complexities of $O(n)$ are inherent to the problem.

```cpp
vector<bool> detectCapitalUse(string word) {
    int n = word.size();
    vector<bool> result(n, false);
    
    // The first element is always false
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = (word[i] > word[i - 1]);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string, because we make a single pass through the string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we create an output array of the same length as the input string.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution is optimal because it achieves the minimum possible time and space complexity required to solve the problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Single-pass iteration, comparison-based decision making.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct comparison of consecutive elements to determine a property of a sequence.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minimizing extra space usage, avoiding unnecessary operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other sequence analysis problems that require comparison of adjacent elements.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to handle the first element as a special case, incorrectly initializing the output array.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input array, single-element input array.
- Performance pitfalls: Using more complex data structures or algorithms than necessary, leading to higher time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Ensure that the solution correctly handles edge cases and produces the expected output for various input scenarios.
