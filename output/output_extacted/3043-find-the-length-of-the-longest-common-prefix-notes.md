## Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-length-of-the-longest-common-prefix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of strings `strs`, find the length of the longest common prefix among all strings in the array. 
- Expected output format: Return the length of the longest common prefix.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - If the array is empty, return 0.
    - If there is no common prefix, return 0.
    - If all strings are identical, return the length of the string.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - Input: `strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]`
      Output: `2`
      Explanation: The common prefix is "fl".
    - Input: `strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]`
      Output: `0`
      Explanation: There is no common prefix.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Compare each character of the first string with the corresponding character of every other string.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Iterate over the characters of the first string.
    2. For each character, compare it with the corresponding character of every other string.
    3. If a mismatch is found, return the length of the common prefix found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward to compare characters one by one.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) {
        if (strs.empty()) return 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < strs[0].size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < strs.size(); j++) {
                if (i == strs[j].size() || strs[j][i] != strs[0][i]) {
                    return i;
                }
            }
        }
        return strs[0].size();
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings and $m$ is the average length of the strings. This is because in the worst case, we need to compare each character of each string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the indices and the length of the common prefix.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the nested loops that compare characters across strings, and the space complexity is constant because we don't use any data structures that scale with input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of comparing the first string with every other string, we can compare the first two strings to find their common prefix, then compare this prefix with the next string, and so on.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Start with the first string as the common prefix.
    2. Iterate over the rest of the strings.
    3. For each string, compare it with the current common prefix.
    4. Update the common prefix to be the common prefix between the current string and the previous common prefix.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the strings, and it uses the minimum amount of comparisons necessary to find the common prefix.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) {
        if (strs.empty()) return 0;
        string prefix = strs[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < strs.size(); i++) {
            while (strs[i].find(prefix) != 0) {
                prefix.pop_back();
                if (prefix.empty()) return 0;
            }
        }
        return prefix.size();
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings and $m$ is the length of the longest string. This is because in the worst case, we need to compare each character of each string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, as we need to store the common prefix.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of comparisons needed to find the common prefix, and it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the prefix.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: 
    - **_String comparison_**: We compared strings character by character to find the common prefix.
    - **_Iterative approach_**: We iterated over the strings to find the common prefix.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: 
    - **_Divide and Conquer_**: We divided the problem into smaller sub-problems by comparing the common prefix with each string.
- Optimization techniques learned: 
    - **_Early termination_**: We terminated the algorithm early when we found a mismatch.
- Similar problems to practice: 
    - **_Longest Common Subsequence_**: Find the longest common subsequence between two strings.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: 
    - **_Off-by-one errors_**: Make sure to check the bounds of the strings correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: 
    - **_Empty strings_**: Handle the case where the input strings are empty.
- Performance pitfalls: 
    - **_Inefficient string comparison_**: Avoid using inefficient string comparison methods.
- Testing considerations: 
    - **_Test with different inputs_**: Test the algorithm with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.
