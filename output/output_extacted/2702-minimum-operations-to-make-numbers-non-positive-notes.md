## Minimum Operations to Make Numbers Non-Positive
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-numbers-non-positive/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq \text{length of } nums \leq 10^5$, $-10^5 \leq \text{each element in } nums \leq 10^5$.
- Expected Output: The minimum number of operations required to make all elements in `nums` non-positive by either subtracting 1 or dividing by 2.
- Key Requirements:
  - Each operation can be applied to any element in the array.
  - The goal is to minimize the total number of operations.
- Example Test Cases:
  - For `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the minimum operations would involve subtracting 1 from each number until they are non-positive.
  - For `nums = [4, 3, 6, 5, 2]`, the optimal strategy might involve dividing by 2 when possible to minimize operations.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves trying all possible combinations of operations (subtracting 1 or dividing by 2) on each element until all are non-positive.
- This approach is straightforward but inefficient due to its exponential time complexity.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int operations = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                // If the number is even, divide by 2 for efficiency
                num /= 2;
            } else {
                // If the number is odd, subtract 1 to make it even for the next step
                num -= 1;
            }
            operations++;
        }
    }
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`, and $m$ is the maximum value in `nums`. This is because in the worst-case scenario, we might need to perform an operation for each element up to its value.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the input array, since we only use a constant amount of space to store the `operations` counter.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we potentially iterate through each number's value, and the space complexity is low because we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is recognizing that for any positive number, the optimal strategy to make it non-positive involves either subtracting 1 or dividing by 2, whichever reduces the number of operations.
- For even numbers, dividing by 2 is always more efficient than subtracting 1 because it reduces the number more significantly.
- For odd numbers, subtracting 1 to make them even and then dividing by 2 is the optimal strategy.

The provided brute force approach is already quite efficient and aligns with the optimal strategy for this problem. It iterates through each number and applies the most efficient operation (either dividing by 2 if the number is even or subtracting 1 if it's odd) until all numbers are non-positive. Thus, the optimal approach is essentially the same as the brute force approach but is recognized as optimal due to its direct and efficient handling of each number.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int operations = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2;
            } else {
                num -= 1;
            }
            operations++;
        }
    }
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \log(m))$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`, and $m$ is the maximum value in `nums`. This is because the number of operations required to reduce a number to 0 is proportional to the logarithm of the number (due to division by 2).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the input array, since we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it applies the most efficient reduction operation at each step, ensuring the minimum number of operations to make each number non-positive.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of analyzing the problem to identify the most efficient operations (in this case, dividing by 2 when possible).
- Understanding how the choice of operation affects the overall complexity and efficiency of the solution.
- Recognizing that sometimes, the brute force approach can be surprisingly close to optimal, especially when the problem allows for a straightforward, efficient strategy.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the division by 2 operation for even numbers, which could lead to unnecessary increments.
- Failing to recognize the logarithmic reduction in the number of operations due to division, leading to an incorrect complexity analysis.
- Not validating the input or handling edge cases properly, which could result in incorrect results or crashes.
