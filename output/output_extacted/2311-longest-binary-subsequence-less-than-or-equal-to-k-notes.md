## Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest subsequence that is less than or equal to `k` when interpreted as a binary number.
- Input format and constraints: 
  - `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
  - `0 <= k <= 10^9`
- Expected output format: The length of the longest binary subsequence.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling cases where `k` is very large or very small.
  - Ensuring the subsequence is a valid binary number.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `s = "1011", k = 10` should return `5` because the longest subsequence is `"1011"` itself, which is `11` in decimal, less than `k`.
  - `s = "0110", k = 1` should return `3` because the longest subsequence that is less than or equal to `1` is `"0"`, but since we can choose any subsequence as long as it's less than or equal to `k`, we can choose `"011"`, which is `3` in length.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to generate all possible subsequences of `s` and check each one to see if it's less than or equal to `k`.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible subsequences of `s`.
  2. For each subsequence, convert it to a decimal number.
  3. Check if the decimal number is less than or equal to `k`.
  4. Keep track of the longest subsequence that meets the condition.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int longestSubsequence(std::string s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    int maxLength = 0;
    
    // Generate all possible subsequences
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        std::string subsequence;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                subsequence += s[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Convert subsequence to decimal
        int decimal = 0;
        for (char c : subsequence) {
            decimal = decimal * 2 + (c - '0');
        }
        
        // Check if decimal is less than or equal to k
        if (decimal <= k) {
            maxLength = std::max(maxLength, (int)subsequence.size());
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`. This is because we generate all possible subsequences (which is $2^n$) and for each, we potentially iterate through its length to convert it to decimal.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the current subsequence.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The exponential time complexity is due to generating all possible subsequences, which grows exponentially with the size of `s`. The linear space complexity is due to storing the subsequence as we generate and process it.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a two-pointer technique to track the longest subsequence that is less than or equal to `k`.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of `s`.
  2. Initialize a variable `current` to keep track of the current decimal value of the subsequence.
  3. Move the `right` pointer to the right, adding the new digit to `current`.
  4. If `current` exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right, subtracting the leftmost digit from `current`.
  5. Keep track of the maximum length of the subsequence that is less than or equal to `k`.

```cpp
int longestSubsequence(std::string s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    int maxLength = 0;
    int current = 0;
    int left = 0;
    
    for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        current = current * 2 + (s[right] - '0');
        
        while (current > k) {
            current -= (s[left] - '0') * (1 << (right - left));
            left++;
        }
        
        maxLength = std::max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`. This is because we make a single pass through `s`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, for storing the pointers and the current decimal value.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we make a single pass through `s` and use a constant amount of space, which is the best we can do given that we must examine each character at least once.
