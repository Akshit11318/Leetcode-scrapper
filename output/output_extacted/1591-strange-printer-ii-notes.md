## Strange Printer II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/strange-printer-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D array of integers `grid` where each cell represents a color.
- Constraints: `1 <= grid.length <= 9`, `1 <= grid[i].length <= 9`, `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 9`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of turns required to print all colors in the grid.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The printer can print a rectangle of the same color in one turn.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - For the grid `[[1,1],[1,2]]`, the output is `2` because we can print the first row in one turn and the second row in another turn.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of rectangles that can be printed in one turn.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible rectangles in the grid.
  2. For each rectangle, check if it contains all colors.
  3. If a rectangle contains all colors, try to print it in one turn and recursively solve the remaining grid.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward way to solve the problem, but it is inefficient due to the large number of possible rectangles.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int strangePrinter(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j] + 1;
                for (int k = i + 1; k <= j; k++) {
                    if (s[i] == s[k]) {
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i + 1][k - 1] + dp[k][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we have three nested loops.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is cubic because we have three nested loops. The space complexity is quadratic because we use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to solve the problem. We create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from index `i` to `j`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the `dp` array with zeros.
  2. Fill the `dp` array in a bottom-up manner. For each substring, try to find a character that is equal to the first character of the substring. If we find such a character, we can print the substring in one turn.
  3. If we cannot find a character that is equal to the first character of the substring, we need to print the substring in two turns.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it tries all possible ways to print the substring and chooses the minimum one.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int strangePrinter(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j] + 1;
                for (int k = i + 1; k <= j; k++) {
                    if (s[i] == s[k]) {
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i + 1][k - 1] + dp[k][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, recursion.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Divide and conquer, memoization.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a dynamic programming table to store intermediate results.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the `Longest Common Subsequence` problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the dynamic programming table correctly, not handling edge cases correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty string, string with only one character.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using memoization, not using a dynamic programming table.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
