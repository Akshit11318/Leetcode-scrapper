## Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-binary-array-elements-equal-to-one-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a binary array `nums`, return the minimum number of operations to make all elements in `nums` equal to one.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations required.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The input array `nums` contains only `0`s and `1`s.
  - The length of `nums` is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
  - Each element in `nums` is either `0` or `1`.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - For `nums = [1,0]`, the minimum number of operations to make all elements equal to one is `1`, as we can change the `0` to `1`.
  - For `nums = [0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]`, the minimum number of operations is `5`, as we need to change the `0`s to `1`s.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One straightforward way to solve this problem is to count the number of `0`s in the array, as changing a `0` to `1` requires one operation.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize a counter to store the number of `0`s in the array.
  2. Iterate over each element in the array.
  3. If an element is `0`, increment the counter.
  4. Return the counter as the minimum number of operations required.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is intuitive because we are directly counting the number of operations needed to change all `0`s to `1`s.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Initialize a counter for the number of 0s
        int count = 0;
        
        // Iterate over each element in the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            // If the element is 0, increment the counter
            if (num == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        // Return the counter as the minimum number of operations
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, because we are iterating over each element once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the counter.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are doing a constant amount of work for each element in the array. The space complexity is constant because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach, as we must examine each element in the array at least once to count the number of `0`s.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Use the `std::count` function from the `<algorithm>` library to count the number of `0`s in the array.
  2. Return the count as the minimum number of operations required.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has the same time complexity as the brute force approach, but uses a more concise and expressive way to count the number of `0`s.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We cannot do better than a linear time complexity because we must examine each element in the array at least once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Use std::count to count the number of 0s
        return count(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, because `std::count` iterates over each element once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because `std::count` uses a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has the same time complexity as the brute force approach, but is more concise and expressive.
