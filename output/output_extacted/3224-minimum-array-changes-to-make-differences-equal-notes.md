## Minimum Array Changes to Make Differences Equal

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-array-changes-to-make-differences-equal/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums` of length `n`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`.
- Expected Output: The minimum number of operations to make all differences between adjacent elements equal.
- Key Requirements: An operation is defined as adding or subtracting 1 from any element in the array.
- Edge Cases: An empty array or an array with a single element requires no operations.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves trying all possible operations on each element to see which set of operations results in the minimum number of changes while achieving the goal of equal differences.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible differences between adjacent elements.
  2. For each possible difference, try to adjust the array to have this difference between all adjacent elements.
  3. Count the number of operations required for each difference.
  4. Return the minimum number of operations found.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() <= 1) return 0; // Edge case handling
    
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    for (int diff = -1000000; diff <= 1000000; ++diff) { // Consider all possible differences
        int ops = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            int target = nums[i] + diff;
            ops += abs(nums[i + 1] - target); // Calculate operations needed for current difference
        }
        minOps = std::min(minOps, ops);
    }
    
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot 2 \cdot 10^6)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because for each of the $n-1$ pairs of adjacent elements, we consider $2 \cdot 10^6$ possible differences.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum operations and the current operations.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inefficient because it tries all possible differences, leading to a high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to realize that the median of the differences between adjacent elements will be the target difference that minimizes the total number of operations. This is because the median is the value that minimizes the sum of absolute differences in a set of numbers.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Calculate the differences between all pairs of adjacent elements.
  2. Find the median of these differences.
  3. Calculate the number of operations needed to adjust all differences to the median difference.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() <= 1) return 0; // Edge case handling
    
    std::vector<int> diffs;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
        diffs.push_back(nums[i + 1] - nums[i]); // Calculate differences
    }
    
    std::sort(diffs.begin(), diffs.end()); // Sort differences to find median
    int medianDiff = diffs[diffs.size() / 2]; // Median difference
    
    int ops = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
        ops += abs(nums[i + 1] - nums[i] - medianDiff); // Calculate operations needed
    }
    
    return ops;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we sort the differences, which takes $O(n \log n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we store the differences between adjacent elements.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the goal, based on the insight that the median difference is the optimal target.
