## Count the Number of Vowel Strings in Range
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-vowel-strings-in-range/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two strings `start` and `end`, both consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Constraints: `start` and `end` are both non-empty and contain at most 5 characters.
- Expected output format: An integer representing the number of vowel strings in the range `[start, end]`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - A string is considered a vowel string if all its characters are vowels.
  - The range is inclusive, meaning both `start` and `end` are included if they are vowel strings.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `start = "a"` and `end = "e"`, the output should be the number of vowel strings between "a" and "e" inclusive.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible strings between `start` and `end`, and then check each string to see if it is a vowel string.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible strings in the range `[start, end]`.
  2. For each string, check if all its characters are vowels.
  3. Count the number of strings that are vowel strings.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward way to ensure we do not miss any possible vowel strings in the range.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool isVowel(char c) {
    return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';
}

int countVowelStrings(const std::string& start, const std::string& end) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = start[0]; i <= end[0]; ++i) {
        char c = (char)i;
        if (isVowel(c)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::string start = "a";
    std::string end = "e";
    std::cout << countVowelStrings(start, end) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of possible characters in the range. This is because we are iterating over each character in the range once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the count and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are checking each character in the range once. The space complexity is constant because we are not using any data structures that grow with the input size.

### Optimal Approach
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Since we are only dealing with single-character strings, we can simply count the number of vowels in the range `[start, end]`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a count variable to 0.
  2. Iterate over each character in the range `[start, end]`.
  3. For each character, check if it is a vowel.
  4. If it is a vowel, increment the count.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the range, and it does not use any additional data structures.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool isVowel(char c) {
    return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';
}

int countVowelStrings(const std::string& start, const std::string& end) {
    int count = 0;
    for (char c = start[0]; c <= end[0]; ++c) {
        if (isVowel(c)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::string start = "a";
    std::string end = "e";
    std::cout << countVowelStrings(start, end) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional statements, and character manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking each character in a range to count the number of vowels.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a single pass over the range to minimize time complexity.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty range or a range with no vowels.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling ranges with non-vowel characters, and ensuring that the start and end characters are within the valid range.
- Performance pitfalls: Using additional data structures or making unnecessary passes over the range, which can increase time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different ranges, including edge cases, to ensure that the solution works correctly.
