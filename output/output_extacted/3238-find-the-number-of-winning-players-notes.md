## Find the Number of Winning Players
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-winning-players/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves a game where two players, `A` and `B`, play in a sequence. Each player's score is determined by their `skill` level and the `difficulty` of the game. The goal is to find the number of winning players for each game.
- Expected output format: Return the number of winning players for each game as an array, where the first element represents the number of winning players for player `A` and the second element represents the number of winning players for player `B`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where the `skill` levels are equal or where the `difficulty` is greater than the `skill` levels.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `skills = [4, 8], difficulties = [1, 2]`, the output should be `[2, 0]` because player `A` wins both games.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Compare the `skill` levels of each player with the `difficulty` of each game to determine the winning player.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each game.
  2. For each game, compare the `skill` levels of player `A` and player `B` with the `difficulty`.
  3. Determine the winning player for each game based on the comparison.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that involves comparing each player's `skill` level with the `difficulty` of each game.

```cpp
vector<int> findWinningPlayers(vector<int>& skills, vector<int>& difficulties) {
    int winA = 0, winB = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < skills.size(); i++) {
        if (skills[i] > difficulties[i]) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) winA++;
            else winB++;
        }
    }
    return {winA, winB};
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of games, because we iterate over each game once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store the count of winning players for each player.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a constant amount of work for each game, and the space complexity is constant because we use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach because we must compare each player's `skill` level with the `difficulty` of each game to determine the winning player.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate over each game.
  2. For each game, compare the `skill` levels of player `A` and player `B` with the `difficulty`.
  3. Determine the winning player for each game based on the comparison.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we must perform at least one comparison for each game to determine the winning player.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must iterate over each game at least once to determine the winning player.

```cpp
vector<int> findWinningPlayers(vector<int>& skills, vector<int>& difficulties) {
    int winA = 0, winB = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < skills.size(); i++) {
        if (skills[i] > difficulties[i]) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) winA++;
            else winB++;
        }
    }
    return {winA, winB};
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration and comparison.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Iterating over each game and comparing the `skill` levels with the `difficulty`.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve iterating over a sequence and comparing values.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the count of winning players to zero.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where the `skill` levels are equal or where the `difficulty` is greater than the `skill` levels.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a constant amount of space to store the count of winning players.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input values and edge cases.
