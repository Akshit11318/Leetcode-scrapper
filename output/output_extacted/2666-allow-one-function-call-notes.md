## Allow One Function Call
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/allow-one-function-call/description

**Problem Statement:**
- The problem asks to determine if it is possible to reach a target value by calling a function at most once. The function takes an integer `n` and returns `n + 1`.
- Input format and constraints: The input consists of a target integer `target` and an initial integer `n`. 
- Expected output format: The output should be a boolean indicating whether it is possible to reach the target value by calling the function at most once.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The function can only be called once, and the target value should be reachable by either not calling the function or calling it once.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible ways to reach the target value by either not calling the function or calling it once.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Check if the target value can be reached without calling the function.
  2. Check if the target value can be reached by calling the function once.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward to try all possible ways to reach the target value.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canReachTarget(int n, int target) {
        // Check if the target value can be reached without calling the function
        if (n == target) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Check if the target value can be reached by calling the function once
        if (n + 1 == target) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // If the target value cannot be reached in either way, return false
        return false;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only perform a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time and space complexities are constant because we only perform a fixed number of operations and use a fixed amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The function can only be called once, so we only need to check two possibilities: reaching the target value without calling the function or reaching the target value by calling the function once.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: We can simplify the solution by combining the two checks into a single conditional statement.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it only performs a constant number of operations and uses a constant amount of space.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We cannot further optimize the solution because we must check both possibilities to determine whether the target value can be reached.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canReachTarget(int n, int target) {
        // Check if the target value can be reached without calling the function or by calling it once
        return n == target || n + 1 == target;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Brute force approach, optimal approach, and complexity analysis.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking all possible ways to reach a target value.
- Optimization techniques learned: Simplifying the solution by combining conditional statements.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve checking all possible ways to reach a target value.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking all possible ways to reach the target value.
- Edge cases to watch for: The target value being equal to the initial value or the initial value plus one.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a non-constant amount of space or performing a non-constant number of operations.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input values to ensure it works correctly.
