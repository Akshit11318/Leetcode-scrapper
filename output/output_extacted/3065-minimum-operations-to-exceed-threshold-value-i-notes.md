## Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value I
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-exceed-threshold-value-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a threshold value `threshold`, a `target` value, and an array `nums`.
- Find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array greater than the threshold value.
- An operation is defined as adding `1` to each element in the array.

**Expected Output Format:**
- The function should return the minimum number of operations required.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases to Consider:**
- The array `nums` can be empty.
- The threshold value can be greater than the target value.
- All elements in the array must be greater than the threshold value after the operations.

**Example Test Cases with Explanations:**
- For `threshold = 5`, `target = 2`, and `nums = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8]`, the output should be `3`.
- For `threshold = 1`, `target = 6`, and `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`, the output should be `0`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to keep adding `1` to each element in the array until all elements are greater than the threshold value.
- We can use a loop to continuously add `1` to each element and check if all elements are greater than the threshold value.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
        int operations = 0;
        while (true) {
            bool allGreater = true;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num <= threshold) {
                    allGreater = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (allGreater) {
                break;
            }
            for (int& num : nums) {
                num++;
            }
            operations++;
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times m)$, where $n$ is the size of the array and $m$ is the maximum number of operations required. In the worst case, $m$ can be equal to the maximum element in the array minus the threshold value.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the number of operations.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are using a nested loop to continuously add `1` to each element and check if all elements are greater than the threshold value. The space complexity is constant because we only use a few variables to store the number of operations and the threshold value.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is that we can find the minimum number of operations required by finding the maximum difference between the threshold value and each element in the array.
- We can use a single loop to find the maximum difference and calculate the minimum number of operations required.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
        int maxDiff = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxDiff = max(maxDiff, threshold - num);
        }
        return maxDiff;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum difference.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we are using a single loop to find the maximum difference and calculate the minimum number of operations required. We are not using any unnecessary operations or data structures, and the time complexity is linear.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The key algorithmic concept demonstrated is the use of a single loop to find the maximum difference and calculate the minimum number of operations required.
- The problem-solving pattern identified is the use of a brute force approach to understand the problem and then optimizing it to find the optimal solution.
- The optimization technique learned is the use of a single loop to reduce the time complexity from $O(n \times m)$ to $O(n)$.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- A common implementation error is using a nested loop to continuously add `1` to each element and check if all elements are greater than the threshold value.
- An edge case to watch for is when the array is empty, and the function should return `0`.
- A performance pitfall is using a brute force approach that has a high time complexity, which can lead to slow performance for large inputs.
