## Count Positions on Street with Required Brightness

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-positions-on-street-with-required-brightness/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `light` representing the brightness of each street light and an integer `threshold`.
- Expected output: The number of positions on the street where the total brightness is greater than or equal to `threshold`.
- Key requirements: Iterate through each position on the street, calculate the total brightness from all `light` positions that can contribute to the current position, and count positions meeting the `threshold`.
- Edge cases: Consider the range of `light` array indices and ensure the calculation accounts for positions where the light's brightness can contribute.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the total brightness for each position by summing the brightness from all lights that can contribute to that position.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize a counter for positions meeting the threshold.
  2. Iterate through each position on the street.
  3. For each position, iterate through the `light` array to calculate the total brightness from all lights that can contribute to the current position.
  4. Check if the total brightness is greater than or equal to the `threshold`. If so, increment the counter.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem by considering each position and summing the relevant brightness values.

```cpp
int countPositions(vector<int>& light, int threshold) {
    int n = light.size();
    int count = 0;
    for (int pos = -n; pos <= 2 * n; pos++) { // Consider all positions
        int brightness = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (abs(pos - i) <= n) { // Light can contribute
                brightness += light[i] / (abs(pos - i) + 1);
            }
        }
        if (brightness >= threshold) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of lights. This is because for each of the $3n+1$ positions, we potentially iterate through all $n$ lights.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and temporary variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The nested loop structure leads to the quadratic time complexity, while the constant space usage is due to not needing any data structures that scale with input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of recalculating the brightness for each position from scratch, observe the change in brightness as we move from one position to the next.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize the total brightness and count of positions meeting the threshold.
  2. Calculate the initial total brightness for the first position.
  3. Iterate through each subsequent position, updating the total brightness by considering the change in contribution from each light.
  4. Check if the updated total brightness meets the threshold and update the count accordingly.
- Proof of optimality: This approach reduces the time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations of brightness contributions for each position.

```cpp
int countPositions(vector<int>& light, int threshold) {
    int n = light.size();
    int count = 0;
    for (int pos = -n; pos <= 2 * n; pos++) {
        int brightness = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (abs(pos - i) <= n) {
                brightness += light[i] / (abs(pos - i) + 1);
            }
        }
        if (brightness >= threshold) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

However, a more efficient approach involves recognizing that the brightness calculation can be optimized by considering the change in brightness as we move along the street, rather than recalculating from scratch for each position. But due to the nature of the problem which requires checking every position with respect to every light source, the optimal approach still involves a form of iteration through positions and lights, albeit with potential optimizations in calculation.

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, due to the nature of the problem requiring consideration of each light's contribution to each position.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The problem inherently requires checking each position against the threshold, considering contributions from all relevant lights, making the $O(n^2)$ time complexity optimal for this specific problem formulation.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts: Iteration, conditional checks, and optimization of calculations.
- Problem-solving patterns: Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts, and considering the change in conditions as we iterate through the problem space.
- Optimization techniques: Avoiding redundant calculations and considering incremental changes.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Incorrectly calculating the brightness contribution from each light to each position.
- Failing to account for all positions that need to be checked.
- Not optimizing the calculation of total brightness for each position, leading to inefficient algorithms.
