## Maximize the Topmost Element After K Moves
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-topmost-element-after-k-moves/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array `arr` of integers and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= k <= 10^9`, and `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`.
- Expected Output: The maximum possible value of the topmost element after `k` moves.
- Key Requirements: Determine the maximum possible value of the topmost element after `k` moves, considering that in each move, you can choose any element from the array and move it to the top of the array.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Example 1: `arr = [5,4,3,2,1]`, `k = 1`. Output: `5`.
- Example 2: `arr = [2,4,2,4,3,1,2]`, `k = 4`. Output: `4`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of moves and keep track of the maximum topmost element after `k` moves.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all permutations of the array of length `k`.
  2. For each permutation, simulate the moves by bringing the elements to the top of the array in the order specified by the permutation.
  3. After `k` moves, check the topmost element and update the maximum if necessary.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to explore all possibilities, but it's inefficient due to the large number of permutations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxTopmostElement(std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int maxElement = INT_MIN;
    // Generate all permutations and simulate moves
    std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        std::vector<int> tempArr = arr;
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            tempArr.insert(tempArr.begin(), tempArr.back());
            tempArr.pop_back();
        }
        maxElement = std::max(maxElement, tempArr[0]);
    }
    return maxElement;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$ due to generating all permutations, where `n` is the length of the array. However, this can be improved by considering the problem constraints and properties of the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the permutations and temporary arrays.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach explores all possible permutations, leading to an exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the storage of temporary arrays.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Since the goal is to maximize the topmost element after `k` moves, we should focus on bringing the largest elements to the top.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Sort the array in ascending order.
  2. If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, the maximum topmost element will be the largest element in the array.
  3. Otherwise, the maximum topmost element will be the `k`-th largest element in the array.
- Proof of optimality: By focusing on the largest elements and considering the number of moves, we can determine the maximum possible topmost element efficiently.

```cpp
int maxTopmostElement(std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    if (k >= arr.size()) {
        return arr.back();
    } else {
        return arr[arr.size() - k - 1];
    }
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to sorting the array, where `n` is the length of the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ if sorting is done in-place, or $O(n)$ if a new sorted array is created.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach focuses on the largest elements and considers the number of moves, resulting in a much more efficient solution than the brute force approach.
