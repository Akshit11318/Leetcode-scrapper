## Count Pairs of Points With Distance K
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-points-with-distance-k/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of points where each point is represented as a pair of integers.
- Constraints: The distance between two points is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
- Expected output format: The number of pairs of points with a distance of K.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where there are multiple pairs with the same distance, and optimizing for performance.

**Example Test Cases:**
- points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]], k = 2. The output should be 2 because the pairs (1,1) and (2,2), and (2,2) and (3,3) have a distance of sqrt(2).
- points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]], k = 3. The output should be 0 because there are no pairs with a distance of 3.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves calculating the distance between each pair of points and checking if it matches the given distance K.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate over each point in the array.
  2. For each point, iterate over the remaining points in the array.
  3. Calculate the Euclidean distance between the two points.
  4. Check if the calculated distance is equal to K. If it is, increment a counter to keep track of the number of pairs with distance K.

```cpp
int countPairs(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < points.size(); j++) {
            int dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0];
            int dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1];
            double distance = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
            if (abs(distance - k) < 1e-9) { // Using a small tolerance for floating point comparison
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ where n is the number of points. This is because we are iterating over each point and for each point, we are iterating over the remaining points.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the count of pairs and the loop variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because of the nested loop structure, and the space complexity is constant because we are not using any data structures that grow with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal solution involves using a hash map to store the points we have seen so far and their frequencies.
- However, for this specific problem, the optimal approach remains similar to the brute force because the calculation of distance is a necessary operation and it inherently requires comparing each pair of points.
- The only optimization possible is to avoid calculating the square root by comparing the squared distances instead.

```cpp
int countPairs(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < points.size(); j++) {
            int dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0];
            int dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1];
            long long squaredDistance = (long long)dx * dx + (long long)dy * dy;
            long long kSquared = (long long)k * k;
            if (squaredDistance == kSquared) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ where n is the number of points. This remains the same as the brute force approach because we still need to compare each pair of points.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the count of pairs and the loop variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the best possible time complexity for this problem because we must at least read the input, which takes $O(n)$ time, and to find all pairs, we must compare each point with every other point, leading to $O(n^2)$ comparisons in the worst case.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Nested loops for comparing pairs of elements, and optimization of floating-point comparisons.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Recognizing that some problems inherently require comparing each element with every other element, leading to a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary calculations, such as square root, by comparing squared values instead.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating distances or incorrectly comparing floating-point numbers.
- Edge cases to watch for: Cases where the distance between two points is exactly K, and cases where the input array is empty or contains a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures that lead to higher than necessary time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness and performance.
