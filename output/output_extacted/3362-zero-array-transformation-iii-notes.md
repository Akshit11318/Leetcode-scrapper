## Zero Array Transformation III
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/zero-array-transformation-iii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `arr` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5` and `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`.
- Expected Output: The array `arr` after performing the transformation `k` times.
- Key Requirements: For each transformation, replace each element `arr[i]` with the sum of `arr[i-1]` (if `i > 0`), `arr[i]`, and `arr[i+1]` (if `i < arr.length - 1`), and then replace all non-zero elements with `1`.
- Edge Cases: Handle out-of-bounds cases when calculating the sum for the first and last elements.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through the array for each transformation, updating each element based on the transformation rule, and then replace all non-zero elements with `1`.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Create a copy of the input array to store the updated values.
  2. For each transformation:
     - For each element in the array, calculate the sum of the current element and its neighbors (if they exist).
     - Update the copied array with the calculated sums.
     - Replace all non-zero elements in the copied array with `1`.
     - Update the original array with the values from the copied array for the next iteration.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the problem statement, applying the transformation rules iteratively.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> transformArray(std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        std::vector<int> temp(arr.size());
        for (int j = 0; j < arr.size(); j++) {
            temp[j] = arr[j];
            if (j > 0) temp[j] += arr[j-1];
            if (j < arr.size() - 1) temp[j] += arr[j+1];
            temp[j] = (temp[j] == 0) ? 0 : 1;
        }
        arr = temp;
    }
    return arr;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the size of the array, because we iterate through the array $k$ times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we create a temporary array of the same size as the input array for each transformation.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The iterative approach for each transformation and the need to store updated values in a temporary array lead to these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The transformation rule essentially depends on the presence of zeros in the neighboring positions. By analyzing the pattern of how zeros propagate or are affected by the transformation, we can find a more efficient way to apply the transformations.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Observe that after the first transformation, all non-zero elements become `1`.
  2. For subsequent transformations, the only elements that can change are those adjacent to a zero.
  3. Thus, we only need to track the positions of zeros and apply the transformation rules based on their presence.
- Proof of optimality: This approach minimizes the number of operations by only considering elements that can change, reducing unnecessary computations.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> transformArray(std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        std::vector<int> temp(arr.size(), 1);
        for (int j = 0; j < arr.size(); j++) {
            if ((j == 0 || arr[j-1] == 0) && (j == arr.size() - 1 || arr[j+1] == 0)) {
                temp[j] = 0;
            }
        }
        arr = temp;
    }
    return arr;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n)$, as we still need to iterate through the array for each transformation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we create a temporary array for each transformation.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations by directly applying the transformation based on the presence of zeros, without calculating unnecessary sums.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts: Iterative array transformations, optimization by reducing unnecessary computations.
- Problem-solving patterns: Analyzing the pattern of transformations to find a more efficient approach.
- Optimization techniques: Focusing on elements that can change and minimizing operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling edge cases (first and last elements).
- Edge cases to watch for: Out-of-bounds access when calculating sums for the first and last elements.
- Performance pitfalls: Applying the transformation to all elements without considering which ones can actually change.
