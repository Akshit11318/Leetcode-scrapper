## Selling Pieces of Wood
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/selling-pieces-of-wood/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves a `m x n` grid representing a piece of wood, where `m` and `n` are integers. Each cell in the grid has a value representing the price of selling a piece of wood of that size. The goal is to find the maximum revenue that can be obtained by cutting the wood into smaller pieces and selling them.
- Expected output format: The function should return the maximum revenue that can be obtained.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The wood can be cut into smaller pieces of any size, and the price of selling a piece of wood is determined by its size. The function should handle edge cases such as an empty grid or a grid with a single cell.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if the grid is `[[1, 3, 1], [1, 5, 1], [4, 2, 1]]`, the maximum revenue that can be obtained is `16`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to try all possible ways of cutting the wood into smaller pieces and calculate the revenue for each possible cut.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize a variable to store the maximum revenue.
  2. Iterate over all possible cuts of the wood, using nested loops to consider all possible sizes of the pieces.
  3. For each possible cut, calculate the revenue by summing the prices of the individual pieces.
  4. Update the maximum revenue if the current revenue is higher.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it has an exponential time complexity due to the nested loops.

```cpp
int sellingWood(vector<vector<int>>& prices, int m, int n) {
    int maxRevenue = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            int revenue = 0;
            for (int x = 0; x < i; x++) {
                for (int y = 0; y < j; y++) {
                    revenue += prices[x][y];
                }
            }
            maxRevenue = max(maxRevenue, revenue);
        }
    }
    return maxRevenue;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m^2 \cdot n^2)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the grid.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum revenue.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is exponential because we have four nested loops, each of which iterates over the dimensions of the grid. The space complexity is constant because we only use a single variable to store the maximum revenue.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use dynamic programming to store the maximum revenue that can be obtained for each possible size of the wood.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(m + 1) x (n + 1)` to store the maximum revenue for each possible size of the wood.
  2. Iterate over all possible sizes of the wood, using nested loops to consider all possible values of `i` and `j`.
  3. For each possible size `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum revenue by considering all possible cuts of the wood into smaller pieces.
  4. Update the `dp` array with the maximum revenue for each possible size.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it avoids redundant calculations by storing the maximum revenue for each possible size of the wood.

```cpp
int sellingWood(vector<vector<int>>& prices, int m, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            for (int x = 1; x <= i; x++) {
                for (int y = 1; y <= j; y++) {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[x - 1][j] + dp[i - x][j]);
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][y - 1] + dp[i][j - y]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[m][n];
}
```

However, the optimal approach to this problem is actually to use a different dynamic programming approach. The idea is to calculate the maximum revenue that can be obtained for each possible width and height of the wood, and then use these values to calculate the maximum revenue for the entire piece of wood.

```cpp
int sellingWood(vector<vector<int>>& prices, int m, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + prices[i - 1][j - 1];
        }
    }
    int maxRevenue = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            for (int x = 1; x <= i; x++) {
                maxRevenue = max(maxRevenue, dp[x][j] + sellingWood(prices, i - x, j));
            }
            for (int y = 1; y <= j; y++) {
                maxRevenue = max(maxRevenue, dp[i][y] + sellingWood(prices, i, j - y));
            }
        }
    }
    return maxRevenue;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, memoization, and recursion.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where we store the maximum revenue for each possible size of the wood and use these values to calculate the maximum revenue for the entire piece of wood.
- Optimization techniques learned: We can optimize the solution by using memoization to store the maximum revenue for each possible size of the wood, and by using a recursive approach to calculate the maximum revenue for the entire piece of wood.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that can be solved using dynamic programming and memoization, such as the Fibonacci sequence and the knapsack problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` array correctly, not updating the `dp` array correctly, and not using memoization correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: The problem has edge cases where the grid is empty or has a single cell, and we need to handle these cases correctly.
- Performance pitfalls: The solution can have a high time complexity if we do not use memoization correctly, and we need to optimize the solution to avoid this.
- Testing considerations: We need to test the solution with different inputs and edge cases to ensure that it works correctly.
