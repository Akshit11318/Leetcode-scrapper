## Minimum Cost Homecoming of a Robot in a Grid

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-homecoming-of-a-robot-in-a-grid/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A grid `grid` with dimensions `m x n`, and the robot's starting position `start` and ending position `end`.
- Constraints: The robot can only move up, down, left, or right, and it must return to the starting position after reaching the ending position.
- Expected Output: The minimum cost to complete the journey.
- Key Requirements: The robot must follow the grid boundaries and the movement rules.
- Edge Cases: The start and end positions may be the same, or the robot may need to move in a straight line.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Example 1:
  - Input: `grid = [[5,3],[4,0],[3,1]]`, `start = [0,0]`, `end = [2,2]`
  - Output: `3`
- Example 2:
  - Input: `grid = [[0,0],[0,0]]`, `start = [0,0]`, `end = [1,1]`
  - Output: `2`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible paths from the start to the end and then back to the start.
- We can use a recursive approach to explore all possible paths.
- This approach comes to mind first because it is straightforward and easy to implement.

```cpp
int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<int>& start, vector<int>& end) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int min_cost = INT_MAX;
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
    
    function<void(int, int, int, bool)> dfs = [&](int x, int y, int cost, bool reached_end) {
        if (x == start[0] && y == start[1] && reached_end) {
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost);
            return;
        }
        
        visited[x][y] = true;
        for (int dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
            for (int dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
                if (abs(dx) + abs(dy) == 1) {
                    int nx = x + dx;
                    int ny = y + dy;
                    if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && !visited[nx][ny]) {
                        if (nx == end[0] && ny == end[1]) {
                            dfs(nx, ny, cost + grid[nx][ny], true);
                        } else if (!reached_end) {
                            dfs(nx, ny, cost + grid[nx][ny], reached_end);
                        } else {
                            dfs(nx, ny, cost + grid[nx][ny], reached_end);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        visited[x][y] = false;
    };
    
    dfs(start[0], start[1], grid[start[0]][start[1]], false);
    return min_cost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(4^{m \cdot n})$ because in the worst case, we need to explore all possible paths.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$ because we need to store the visited cells.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are using a recursive approach to explore all possible paths, and the space complexity is moderate because we need to store the visited cells to avoid infinite loops.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a dynamic programming approach to store the minimum cost to reach each cell from the start and from the end.
- We can use two 2D arrays, `dp_start` and `dp_end`, to store the minimum cost to reach each cell from the start and from the end, respectively.
- We can fill up these arrays by iterating over the grid from the start and from the end.

```cpp
int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<int>& start, vector<int>& end) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp_start(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    vector<vector<int>> dp_end(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    
    dp_start[start[0]][start[1]] = grid[start[0]][start[1]];
    dp_end[end[0]][end[1]] = grid[end[0]][end[1]];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i > 0) {
                dp_start[i][j] = min(dp_start[i][j], dp_start[i - 1][j] + grid[i][j]);
            }
            if (j > 0) {
                dp_start[i][j] = min(dp_start[i][j], dp_start[i][j - 1] + grid[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (i < m - 1) {
                dp_end[i][j] = min(dp_end[i][j], dp_end[i + 1][j] + grid[i][j]);
            }
            if (j < n - 1) {
                dp_end[i][j] = min(dp_end[i][j], dp_end[i][j + 1] + grid[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    int min_cost = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            min_cost = min(min_cost, dp_start[i][j] + dp_end[i][j] - grid[i][j]);
        }
    }
    
    return min_cost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$ because we need to iterate over the grid twice to fill up the `dp_start` and `dp_end` arrays.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$ because we need to store the `dp_start` and `dp_end` arrays.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are using dynamic programming to store the minimum cost to reach each cell from the start and from the end, which allows us to avoid exploring all possible paths.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The key algorithmic concept demonstrated is dynamic programming.
- The problem-solving pattern identified is using dynamic programming to store the minimum cost to reach each cell from the start and from the end.
- The optimization technique learned is using dynamic programming to avoid exploring all possible paths.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- A common implementation error is not initializing the `dp_start` and `dp_end` arrays correctly.
- An edge case to watch for is when the start and end positions are the same.
- A performance pitfall is using a recursive approach to explore all possible paths, which can lead to high time complexity.
