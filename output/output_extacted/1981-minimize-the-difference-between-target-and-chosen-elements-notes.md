## Minimize the Difference Between Target and Chosen Elements
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-difference-between-target-and-chosen-elements/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array `mat` of integers, a target integer `target`.
- Constraints: `1 <= mat.length <= 70`, `1 <= mat[i].length <= 1000`, `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1`, `0 <= target <= 2^31 - 1`.
- Expected output format: The minimum possible difference between `target` and the sum of chosen elements.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The goal is to find a subset of elements from the given matrix such that their sum is closest to the target. The matrix can have varying dimensions, and the target can range from 0 to a large number.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to generate all possible subsets of the matrix elements and calculate their sums.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of the matrix elements.
  2. Calculate the sum of each subset.
  3. Find the subset sum that is closest to the target.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward method to consider all possibilities and find the optimal solution.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minimizeTheDifference(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int target) {
    int n = mat.size();
    int m = mat[0].size();
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all possible subsets
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << (n * m)); mask++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << (i * m + j))) != 0) {
                    sum += mat[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        minDiff = min(minDiff, abs(target - sum));
    }
    return minDiff;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{nm})$ because we generate all possible subsets of the matrix elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum difference and the current subset sum.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is exponential because we consider all possible subsets, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to store the possible sums of subsets for each row and then combine them to find the closest sum to the target.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a set to store the possible sums of subsets for the first row.
  2. For each subsequent row, update the set of possible sums by adding each element of the current row to the existing sums.
  3. After processing all rows, find the sum in the set that is closest to the target.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible sums of subsets in a efficient manner, avoiding the exponential time complexity of the brute force approach.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minimizeTheDifference(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int target) {
    int n = mat.size();
    int m = mat[0].size();
    set<int> sums;
    sums.insert(0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        set<int> newSums;
        for (int sum : sums) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                newSums.insert(sum + mat[i][j]);
            }
        }
        sums = newSums;
    }
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;
    for (int sum : sums) {
        minDiff = min(minDiff, abs(target - sum));
    }
    return minDiff;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot 2^m)$ because we process each row and each element in the row, and the number of possible sums grows exponentially with the number of columns.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^m)$ because we store the possible sums of subsets for each row.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it efficiently considers all possible sums of subsets and finds the closest sum to the target, avoiding the exponential time complexity of the brute force approach.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, subset sum problem.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems, using a set to store possible sums.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding exponential time complexity by using dynamic programming.
- Similar problems to practice: Subset sum problem, knapsack problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the set of possible sums correctly, not updating the set of possible sums correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where the target is 0, handling the case where the matrix is empty.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an exponential time complexity approach, not using dynamic programming to store possible sums.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
