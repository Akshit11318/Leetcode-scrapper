## Find the Sum of Encrypted Integers
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-sum-of-encrypted-integers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `encrypted` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq k \leq 40$, $1 \leq encrypted.length \leq k$, $1 \leq encrypted[i] \leq k$.
- Expected Output: The sum of the encrypted integers.
- Key Requirements: Find the sum of the encrypted integers, where each integer is encrypted by replacing each digit $d$ with $k + d$.
- Edge Cases: Handle cases where $k$ is equal to the maximum possible value, and the input array is empty.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to directly calculate the encrypted sum by iterating over each integer in the `encrypted` array, decrypting it, and adding it to the sum.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize the sum to 0.
  2. Iterate over each integer in the `encrypted` array.
  3. For each integer, iterate over each digit and decrypt it by subtracting $k$.
  4. Add the decrypted integer to the sum.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
int findSumOfEncryptedIntegers(vector<int>& encrypted, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : encrypted) {
        int decryptedNum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            int digit = num % 10;
            decryptedNum = decryptedNum * 10 + (digit - k);
            num /= 10;
        }
        sum += decryptedNum;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of integers in the `encrypted` array and $m$ is the maximum number of digits in an integer. This is because we iterate over each integer and each digit in the integer.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and temporary variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we have nested loops, and the space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to notice that the encryption process is equivalent to adding $k$ to each digit, which means we can simply add $k$ to each digit without actually decrypting the integers.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize the sum to 0.
  2. Iterate over each integer in the `encrypted` array.
  3. For each integer, iterate over each digit and add $k$ to it.
  4. Add the encrypted integer to the sum.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it eliminates the need to decrypt the integers, reducing the time complexity.

```cpp
int findSumOfEncryptedIntegers(vector<int>& encrypted, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : encrypted) {
        sum += num;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of integers in the `encrypted` array. This is because we only iterate over each integer once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has the lowest possible time complexity, and we cannot further reduce the time complexity without changing the problem statement.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, encryption, and decryption.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Looking for patterns in the problem statement to simplify the solution.
