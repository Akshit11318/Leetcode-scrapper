## K Items With the Maximum Sum
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/k-items-with-the-maximum-sum/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves finding the maximum sum of `k` items that can be selected from a list of numbers, with the constraint that the numbers must be non-negative.
- Expected output format: The function should return the maximum sum of `k` items.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The function should handle cases where `k` is greater than the number of items in the list, and it should also handle cases where the list is empty.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `k = 3`, `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Output: `12`. Explanation: The maximum sum of 3 items is `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`.
  - Example 2: Input: `k = 2`, `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Output: `9`. Explanation: The maximum sum of 2 items is `4 + 5 = 9`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves checking all possible combinations of `k` items from the list and calculating their sum.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of `k` items from the list.
  2. Calculate the sum of each combination.
  3. Keep track of the maximum sum found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it is not efficient for large inputs.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int kItemsWithMaximumSum(int k, std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int maxSum = 0;
    std::sort(arr.rbegin(), arr.rend());
    for (int i = 0; i < k && i < arr.size(); i++) {
        maxSum += arr[i];
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of items in the list. This is because we are sorting the list.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because of the sorting operation, and the space complexity occurs because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is that we can simply sort the list in descending order and then select the first `k` items.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the list in descending order.
  2. Select the first `k` items from the sorted list.
  3. Calculate the sum of the selected items.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures that we select the `k` items with the maximum sum.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we are already selecting the `k` items with the maximum sum.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int kItemsWithMaximumSum(int k, std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int maxSum = 0;
    std::sort(arr.rbegin(), arr.rend());
    for (int i = 0; i < k && i < arr.size(); i++) {
        maxSum += arr[i];
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it ensures that we select the `k` items with the maximum sum.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, selection, and calculation of sum.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be solved by sorting the list and then selecting the first `k` items.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimization technique used is sorting the list in descending order.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve sorting and selection, such as finding the minimum or maximum value in a list.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty list or `k` being greater than the number of items in the list.
- Edge cases to watch for: An empty list or `k` being greater than the number of items in the list.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using an efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
