## Sorting Three Groups

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sorting-three-groups/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a `2D vector` `nums` where `nums[i] = [a, b, c]` representing three groups with values `a`, `b`, and `c`, we need to sort the groups based on a custom sorting order provided by a `2D vector` `target`.
- Expected output format: A `2D vector` where each inner vector represents the sorted values of the corresponding group.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The `target` vector defines the custom sorting order. We must ensure that the sorting is stable (preserves the order of equal elements).
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if `nums = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]` and `target = [[1,2,3]]`, the output should be `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]` since the first group's values match the target order.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Create a mapping of the target values to their indices for efficient lookups. Then, sort each group in `nums` based on the custom order defined by `target`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a `map` to store the target values and their indices for efficient lookups.
  2. Iterate over each group in `nums`.
  3. For each group, sort its values based on the custom order defined by `target`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem by using the target values to sort the groups, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>

vector<vector<int>> sortGroups(vector<vector<int>>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& target) {
    // Create a map for efficient lookups of target values
    map<int, int> targetMap;
    for (int i = 0; i < target[0].size(); i++) {
        targetMap[target[0][i]] = i;
    }

    // Sort each group based on the custom order
    for (auto& group : nums) {
        sort(group.begin(), group.end(), [&targetMap](int a, int b) {
            return targetMap[a] < targetMap[b];
        });
    }

    return nums;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot log(m))$ where $n$ is the number of groups and $m$ is the number of elements in each group. This is because we sort each group of $m$ elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$ for storing the target map, where $m$ is the number of unique target values.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation for each group, and the space complexity is due to the map used for efficient lookups of target values.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same approach as the brute force is already optimal because we must sort each group based on the custom order, and using a map for lookups is the most efficient way to determine the order of elements within each group.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The approach remains the same as the brute force, as it is already optimal.
- Proof of optimality: Any solution must at least read the input and write the output, which takes linear time. Additionally, since we must sort the groups based on a custom order, we cannot do better than sorting each group, which takes $O(n \cdot m \cdot log(m))$ time in the worst case.

```cpp
// The code remains the same as the brute force approach
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot log(m))$ where $n$ is the number of groups and $m$ is the number of elements in each group.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$ for storing the target map.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to sort the groups based on the custom order.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly implementing the custom sorting order or failing to handle edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: Groups with duplicate values, target values that are not present in the groups.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient data structures or algorithms that lead to higher time or space complexities.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with different inputs and edge cases to ensure correctness and efficiency.
