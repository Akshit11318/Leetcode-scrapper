## Strictly Palindromic Number
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/strictly-palindromic-number/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an integer `n`, determine if it is a **strictly palindromic number** in the given base from `2` to `n-1`.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if `n` is a strictly palindromic number, otherwise return `false`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The number must be a palindrome in at least one base from `2` to `n-1`, and it must not be a palindrome in any base greater than `1`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, `9` is not a strictly palindromic number because it is a palindrome in base `10` but not in any base from `2` to `8`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first step is to convert the number to different bases and check if it is a palindrome.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each base from `2` to `n-1`.
  2. Convert the number to the current base.
  3. Check if the converted number is a palindrome.
  4. If it is a palindrome, return `true`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it may not be efficient for large numbers.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isStrictlyPalindromic(int n) {
        // Iterate through each base from 2 to n-1
        for (int base = 2; base < n; base++) {
            // Convert the number to the current base
            string converted = "";
            int num = n;
            while (num > 0) {
                converted = to_string(num % base) + converted;
                num /= base;
            }
            // Check if the converted number is a palindrome
            string reversed = converted;
            reverse(reversed.begin(), reversed.end());
            if (converted == reversed) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because we iterate through each base from `2` to `n-1`, and for each base, we convert the number to that base, which takes $O(\log n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because we need to store the converted number, which has at most $O(\log n)$ digits.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we iterate through each base and convert the number to that base. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the converted number.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is that a number is a strictly palindromic number if and only if it is not a palindrome in any base from `2` to `n-1`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate through each base from `2` to `n-1`.
  2. Convert the number to the current base.
  3. Check if the converted number is a palindrome.
  4. If it is not a palindrome, continue to the next base.
  5. If we have checked all bases and found no palindrome, return `false`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it checks all possible bases and returns as soon as it finds a palindrome.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isStrictlyPalindromic(int n) {
        // Iterate through each base from 2 to n-1
        for (int base = 2; base < n; base++) {
            // Convert the number to the current base
            string converted = "";
            int num = n;
            while (num > 0) {
                converted = to_string(num % base) + converted;
                num /= base;
            }
            // Check if the converted number is a palindrome
            string reversed = converted;
            reverse(reversed.begin(), reversed.end());
            if (converted == reversed) {
                return false; // If it's a palindrome, return false
            }
        }
        return false; // If we've checked all bases and found no palindrome, return false
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The key concept demonstrated is the conversion of numbers to different bases and checking for palindromes.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The pattern identified is to iterate through each base and check for palindromes.

- Similar problems to practice: Similar problems to practice include converting numbers to different bases and checking for palindromes.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: A common implementation error is to not handle the case where the input number is `1`.
- Edge cases to watch for: An edge case to watch for is when the input number is `0`.
- Performance pitfalls: A performance pitfall is to not return as soon as a palindrome is found.
- Testing considerations: A testing consideration is to test the function with different input numbers and bases.
