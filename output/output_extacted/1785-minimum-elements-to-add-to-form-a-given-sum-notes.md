## Minimum Elements to Add to Form a Given Sum
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-elements-to-add-to-form-a-given-sum/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums` and an integer `limit`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`, and `1 <= limit <= 10^5`.
- Output: The minimum number of elements to add to `nums` to form a given sum.
- Key requirements: Find the minimum number of elements to add to `nums` such that the sum of `nums` and the added elements is equal to `limit`.
- Example test cases: 
  - Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `limit = 15`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: We can add `10` to `nums` to form a sum of `15`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The brute force approach involves trying all possible combinations of numbers that can be added to `nums` to form a sum equal to `limit`.
- We start by initializing a variable `min_elements` to a large value, representing the minimum number of elements to add.
- We then generate all possible combinations of numbers that can be added to `nums`.
- For each combination, we calculate the sum of `nums` and the added numbers.
- If the sum is equal to `limit`, we update `min_elements` if the number of elements in the current combination is less than the current value of `min_elements`.
- Finally, we return `min_elements` as the minimum number of elements to add to `nums`.

```cpp
int minElements(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
    int sum = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
    int min_elements = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) {
        int temp_sum = sum;
        int count = 0;
        while (temp_sum < limit) {
            temp_sum += i;
            count++;
        }
        if (temp_sum == limit) {
            min_elements = min(min_elements, count);
        }
    }
    return min_elements;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times limit)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are generating all possible combinations of numbers that can be added to `nums`, and for each combination, we are calculating the sum of `nums` and the added numbers.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach involves using a mathematical formula to calculate the minimum number of elements to add to `nums`.
- We start by calculating the sum of `nums` using the `accumulate` function.
- We then calculate the difference between `limit` and the sum of `nums`.
- If the difference is less than or equal to 0, we return 0, as no elements need to be added.
- Otherwise, we calculate the minimum number of elements to add using the formula `(limit - sum - 1) / limit + 1`.
- This formula works because we are essentially dividing the difference between `limit` and the sum of `nums` by `limit`, and rounding up to the nearest integer.

```cpp
int minElements(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
    int sum = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
    if (sum >= limit) return 0;
    return (limit - sum - 1) / limit + 1;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are using a mathematical formula to calculate the minimum number of elements to add, which eliminates the need to generate all possible combinations of numbers.
