## Symmetric Coordinates

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-coordinates/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes in two integers `x` and `y` as input, representing the coordinates of a point. The task is to find the symmetric point with respect to the origin.
- Expected output format: The output should be a string in the format `(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the symmetric point.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The symmetric point with respect to the origin is obtained by negating the x and y coordinates of the original point.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `x = 1, y = 2`
  - Output: `(-1, -2)`
  - Explanation: The symmetric point of `(1, 2)` with respect to the origin is `(-1, -2)`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to directly calculate the symmetric point by negating the x and y coordinates.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Take in the input coordinates `x` and `y`.
  2. Negate the x and y coordinates to obtain the symmetric point.
  3. Format the output as a string in the required format `(x, y)`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most direct and intuitive way to solve the problem, as it directly applies the definition of symmetric points with respect to the origin.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string symmetricCoordinates(int x, int y) {
        // Calculate the symmetric point by negating the x and y coordinates
        int symmetricX = -x;
        int symmetricY = -y;
        
        // Format the output as a string
        return "(" + to_string(symmetricX) + ", " + to_string(symmetricY) + ")";
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the solution involves a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the solution uses a constant amount of space to store the input and output coordinates.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The solution has constant time and space complexities because it only involves a fixed number of arithmetic operations and does not depend on the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is essentially the same as the brute force approach, as the problem can be solved in constant time by directly negating the x and y coordinates.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Take in the input coordinates `x` and `y`.
  2. Negate the x and y coordinates to obtain the symmetric point.
  3. Format the output as a string in the required format `(x, y)`.
- Proof of optimality: The solution has a time complexity of $O(1)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem, as it involves a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because the problem can be solved in constant time, and any additional operations would only increase the time complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string symmetricCoordinates(int x, int y) {
        // Calculate the symmetric point by negating the x and y coordinates
        return "(" + to_string(-x) + ", " + to_string(-y) + ")";
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the solution involves a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the solution uses a constant amount of space to store the input and output coordinates.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution is optimal because it has the best possible time complexity of $O(1)$, and any further optimization would not improve the time complexity.
