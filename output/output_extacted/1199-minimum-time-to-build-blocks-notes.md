## Minimum Time to Build Blocks

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-build-blocks/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer array `blocks` and an integer `split`.
- Constraints: `1 <= blocks.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= blocks[i] <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: The minimum time needed to build the blocks.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The time needed to build a block is equal to the maximum time needed to build its children. If a block has no children, the time needed to build it is `1`. A block can be split into two smaller blocks, and the time needed to build the block is the maximum time needed to build the two smaller blocks plus `1`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if `blocks = [1, 2, 3]` and `split = 2`, the minimum time needed to build the blocks is `3`, because the blocks can be built in the order `1`, `2`, `3`, with the first block taking `1` time unit, the second block taking `1` time unit, and the third block taking `1` time unit.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible ways to split the blocks and calculating the minimum time needed to build the blocks.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `min_time` to store the minimum time needed to build the blocks.
  2. Iterate over all possible ways to split the blocks.
  3. For each way to split the blocks, calculate the time needed to build the blocks.
  4. Update `min_time` if the time needed to build the blocks is less than the current `min_time`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is often the first approach that comes to mind because it is simple and straightforward.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minTimeToBuildBlocks(std::vector<int>& blocks, int split) {
    int n = blocks.size();
    int min_time = INT_MAX;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        std::vector<int> children;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                children.push_back(blocks[i]);
            }
        }
        int time = 1;
        if (!children.empty()) {
            time = minTimeToBuildBlocks(children, split) + 1;
        }
        min_time = std::min(min_time, time);
    }
    return min_time;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of blocks. This is because we are trying all possible ways to split the blocks, and for each way, we are calculating the time needed to build the blocks.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of blocks. This is because we are using a recursive approach to calculate the time needed to build the blocks.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are trying all possible ways to split the blocks, and the space complexity occurs because we are using a recursive approach.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is that the minimum time needed to build the blocks can be calculated using dynamic programming.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable `dp` to store the minimum time needed to build the blocks.
  2. Iterate over all possible ways to split the blocks.
  3. For each way to split the blocks, calculate the time needed to build the blocks using the `dp` array.
  4. Update the `dp` array with the minimum time needed to build the blocks.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it avoids the overlapping subproblems that occur in the brute force approach.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minTimeToBuildBlocks(std::vector<int>& blocks, int split) {
    int n = blocks.size();
    std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
        for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
            dp[i] = std::min(dp[i], std::max(dp[j], dp[i - j]) + 1);
        }
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of blocks. This is because we are using a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum time needed to build the blocks.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of blocks. This is because we are using a `dp` array to store the minimum time needed to build the blocks.
> - **Optimality proof:** The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it avoids the overlapping subproblems that occur in the brute force approach.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, recursion.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Avoiding overlapping subproblems.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using dynamic programming to avoid overlapping subproblems.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the Fibonacci sequence or the longest common subsequence.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` array correctly, not updating the `dp` array correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: The base case of the recursion, the case where the input array is empty.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach instead of a dynamic programming approach.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input arrays, testing the function with different split values.
