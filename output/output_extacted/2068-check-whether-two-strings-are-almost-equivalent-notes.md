## Check Whether Two Strings Are Almost Equivalent

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-whether-two-strings-are-almost-equivalent/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two strings `word1` and `word2`.
- Constraints: Both strings consist of lowercase letters only and have the same length.
- Expected output format: A boolean indicating whether `word1` and `word2` are almost equivalent.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Two strings are almost equivalent if the frequency of each character in `word1` is equal to the frequency of the same character in `word2`, with an exception of at most one character where the frequencies can differ by 1.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"`: Returns `true` because the frequencies of each character are the same in both strings.
  - `word1 = "abc", word2 = "bcb"`: Returns `true` because the frequencies of 'a' and 'b' are the same, and 'c' differs by 1.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Compare the frequency of each character in both strings and check if the difference in frequency for any character is more than 1.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create two frequency arrays for `word1` and `word2`.
  2. Iterate through each character in the strings to fill the frequency arrays.
  3. Compare the frequency arrays to find any differences.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward to calculate the frequency of characters and compare them.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

bool checkAlmostEquivalent(std::string word1, std::string word2) {
    int freq1[26] = {0}, freq2[26] = {0};
    for (char c : word1) freq1[c - 'a']++;
    for (char c : word2) freq2[c - 'a']++;

    int diffCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (abs(freq1[i] - freq2[i]) > 1) return false;
        if (abs(freq1[i] - freq2[i]) == 1) diffCount++;
        if (diffCount > 1) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input strings, because we iterate through each character in the strings once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the size of the frequency arrays is constant (26 for lowercase English letters).
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear due to the single pass through the input strings, and the space complexity is constant because the frequency arrays have a fixed size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same approach as the brute force is already optimal because we must check each character's frequency at least once.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The solution remains the same as the brute force approach because it's already optimal.
- Proof of optimality: Any solution must at least read the input strings once, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$. The space complexity of $O(1)$ is optimal because we only need a constant amount of space to store the frequency arrays.

```cpp
// Same as the brute force approach
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input strings.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the size of the frequency arrays is constant.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution is optimal because it has the minimum time and space complexity required to solve the problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Frequency counting and comparison.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using frequency arrays to compare character distributions in strings.
- Optimization techniques learned: Recognizing when a brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string comparison problems involving frequency or permutation.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect indexing or off-by-one errors when accessing the frequency arrays.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling empty strings or strings with different lengths.
- Performance pitfalls: Assuming a more complex solution is necessary when a simple approach suffices.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with various input cases, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
