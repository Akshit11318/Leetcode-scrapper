## Moving Stones Until Consecutive II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-stones-until-consecutive-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the positions of the three stones.
- Constraints: $1 \leq a < b < c \leq 10^9$
- Expected output format: The minimum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Stones are initially not consecutive.
  - Each move can only be one of two types: move a stone to an adjacent position (either left or right) or move a stone to a position that is two steps away (either left or right).
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 5`. Output: `3`. Explanation: We can move the stone at position `c` to position `3`, then move the stone at position `c` to position `4`, and finally move the stone at position `c` to position `3` again.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible moves for each stone and calculate the minimum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible moves for each stone.
  2. For each possible move, calculate the new positions of the stones.
  3. Check if the stones are consecutive in the new positions.
  4. If the stones are consecutive, update the minimum number of moves required.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach, but it is inefficient due to the large number of possible moves.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToMakeConsecutive(int a, int b, int c) {
        int minMoves = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = a; i <= c; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= c; j++) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k <= c; k++) {
                    int moves = abs(i - a) + abs(j - b) + abs(k - c);
                    minMoves = min(minMoves, moves);
                }
            }
        }
        return minMoves;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum stone positions.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum number of moves.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs due to the three nested loops, and the space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can sort the stone positions and calculate the minimum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive by considering the differences between the stone positions.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the stone positions in ascending order.
  2. Calculate the differences between the stone positions.
  3. If the differences are 1 and 2, we can make the stones consecutive by moving the middle stone to the left or right.
  4. If the differences are 1 and more than 2, we can make the stones consecutive by moving the rightmost stone to the left.
  5. If the differences are more than 1 and 1, we can make the stones consecutive by moving the leftmost stone to the right.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible cases and calculates the minimum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToMakeConsecutive(int a, int b, int c) {
        int minVal = min(a, min(b, c));
        int maxVal = max(a, max(b, c));
        int midVal = a + b + c - minVal - maxVal;
        
        if (maxVal - minVal == 2) {
            return 0;
        } else if (maxVal - midVal == 1 && midVal - minVal == 2) {
            return 1;
        } else if (maxVal - midVal == 2 && midVal - minVal == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 2;
        }
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only perform a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum number of moves.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it considers all possible cases and calculates the minimum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, difference calculation, and case analysis.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Considering all possible cases and calculating the minimum number of moves required.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the number of operations by considering the differences between the stone positions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not considering all possible cases, not calculating the differences between the stone positions correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: When the stone positions are already consecutive, when the differences between the stone positions are 1 and 2.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach, not considering the differences between the stone positions.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases and corner cases.
