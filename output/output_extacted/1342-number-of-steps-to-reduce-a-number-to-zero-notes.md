## Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `num`.
- Constraints: `0 <= num <= 10^6`.
- Expected output: The minimum number of operations required to reduce `num` to zero.
- Key requirements: The allowed operations are either subtracting 1 from `num` or dividing `num` by 2 if `num` is even.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `num = 14`, Output: `6` (Explanation: `14 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0`).
  - Input: `num = 8`, Output: `3` (Explanation: `8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0`).
  - Input: `num = 123`, Output: `12` (Explanation: `123 -> 122 -> 61 -> 60 -> 30 -> 29 -> 28 -> 14 -> 13 -> 12 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0`).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to simulate the process of reducing the number to zero by iteratively applying the allowed operations.
- We start with the input number `num` and apply the operations one by one, keeping track of the number of operations performed.
- If `num` is even, we divide it by 2; otherwise, we subtract 1 from it.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly follows the problem statement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSteps(int num) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2; // If num is even, divide it by 2
            } else {
                num -= 1; // If num is odd, subtract 1 from it
            }
            steps++; // Increment the step counter
        }
        return steps;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(log(n))$, where $n$ is the input number `num`. This is because in the worst-case scenario, we are dividing the number by 2 in each step, which leads to a logarithmic time complexity.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the input number and the step counter.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is logarithmic because we are effectively reducing the size of the input number by half in each step when it is even, similar to a binary search. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is that the problem can be solved using a simple iterative approach, as shown in the brute force solution.
- The detailed breakdown of the approach involves iteratively applying the allowed operations until the number becomes zero.
- The proof of optimality lies in the fact that we are always choosing the operation that reduces the number of steps required to reach zero, either by dividing by 2 (when the number is even) or by subtracting 1 (when the number is odd).
- Further optimization is impossible because we are already using the most efficient operations allowed by the problem statement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSteps(int num) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2; // If num is even, divide it by 2
            } else {
                num -= 1; // If num is odd, subtract 1 from it
            }
            steps++; // Increment the step counter
        }
        return steps;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iterative approach, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Reducing a problem to a series of simple operations and analyzing the time and space complexity.
- Optimization techniques learned: Choosing the most efficient operation at each step to minimize the total number of steps required.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving iterative approaches and basic arithmetic operations, such as calculating the sum of digits of a number or finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling the case where the input number is zero, or not correctly updating the step counter.
- Edge cases to watch for: The input number being zero, or the input number being a large number that requires many steps to reduce to zero.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a recursive approach instead of an iterative approach, which can lead to a stack overflow for large input numbers.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with a variety of input numbers, including small and large numbers, and edge cases such as zero.
