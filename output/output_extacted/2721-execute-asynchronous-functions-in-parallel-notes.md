## Execute Asynchronous Functions in Parallel
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/execute-asynchronous-functions-in-parallel/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a list of asynchronous functions that need to be executed in parallel.
- Expected output format: The output should be the results of the asynchronous functions in the order they were executed.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The asynchronous functions should be executed in parallel, and the results should be returned in the order they were executed.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - For example, if we have two asynchronous functions `asyncFunction1` and `asyncFunction2`, the output should be the results of `asyncFunction1` and `asyncFunction2` in the order they were executed.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The initial thought process is to execute each asynchronous function sequentially and store the results in a list.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a list to store the results of the asynchronous functions.
  2. Iterate over each asynchronous function.
  3. Execute each asynchronous function and store the result in the list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it does not take advantage of the parallel nature of asynchronous functions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <future>

// Define a function to execute asynchronous functions in parallel
std::vector<int> executeAsynchronousFunctions(std::vector<std::function<int()>> functions) {
    std::vector<int> results;
    for (auto& function : functions) {
        results.push_back(function());
    }
    return results;
}

// Define an example asynchronous function
int asyncFunction1() {
    // Simulate some work
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    return 1;
}

int asyncFunction2() {
    // Simulate some work
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    return 2;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::function<int()>> functions = {asyncFunction1, asyncFunction2};
    std::vector<int> results = executeAsynchronousFunctions(functions);
    for (auto& result : results) {
        std::cout << result << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times t)$, where $n$ is the number of asynchronous functions and $t$ is the time it takes to execute each function.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of asynchronous functions.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are executing each asynchronous function sequentially, and the space complexity occurs because we are storing the results of each function in a list.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use `std::async` to execute each asynchronous function in parallel.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a list to store the futures of the asynchronous functions.
  2. Iterate over each asynchronous function.
  3. Use `std::async` to execute each asynchronous function in parallel and store the future in the list.
  4. Use `std::future::get` to get the result of each function.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it takes advantage of the parallel nature of asynchronous functions.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we are already executing each function in parallel.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <future>

// Define a function to execute asynchronous functions in parallel
std::vector<int> executeAsynchronousFunctions(std::vector<std::function<int()>> functions) {
    std::vector<std::future<int>> futures;
    for (auto& function : functions) {
        futures.push_back(std::async(std::launch::async, function));
    }
    std::vector<int> results;
    for (auto& future : futures) {
        results.push_back(future.get());
    }
    return results;
}

// Define an example asynchronous function
int asyncFunction1() {
    // Simulate some work
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    return 1;
}

int asyncFunction2() {
    // Simulate some work
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    return 2;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::function<int()>> functions = {asyncFunction1, asyncFunction2};
    std::vector<int> results = executeAsynchronousFunctions(functions);
    for (auto& result : results) {
        std::cout << result << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The key algorithmic concept demonstrated is the use of `std::async` to execute asynchronous functions in parallel.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem-solving pattern identified is to use parallel processing to improve the performance of asynchronous functions.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimization technique learned is to use `std::async` to execute asynchronous functions in parallel.
- Similar problems to practice: Similar problems to practice include executing asynchronous functions in parallel with dependencies between them.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: A common implementation error is to forget to use `std::launch::async` when using `std::async`.
- Edge cases to watch for: An edge case to watch for is when the number of asynchronous functions is greater than the number of available threads.
- Performance pitfalls: A performance pitfall is to use `std::async` with a large number of asynchronous functions without considering the available resources.
- Testing considerations: A testing consideration is to test the code with different numbers of asynchronous functions and different types of asynchronous functions.
