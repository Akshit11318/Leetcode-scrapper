## Maximize Happiness of Selected Children
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-happiness-of-selected-children/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `children` - a list of integers representing the happiness of each child, and `initial_happiness` - an integer representing the initial happiness of the group.
- Constraints: The input list `children` can be empty or contain up to $10^5$ integers. The initial happiness `initial_happiness` is a non-negative integer.
- Expected Output: The maximum happiness that can be achieved by selecting a subset of children.
- Key Requirements: The happiness of the selected children should be maximized, considering that the happiness of the group decreases by 1 for each child that is not selected.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `children = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], initial_happiness = 0` - The maximum happiness is achieved by selecting all children, resulting in a happiness of 15.
  - `children = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], initial_happiness = 0` - The maximum happiness is achieved by selecting all children, resulting in a happiness of 15.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible subsets of children and calculate the happiness for each subset.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of children.
  2. For each subset, calculate the happiness by summing the happiness of the selected children and subtracting the number of children that are not selected.
  3. Keep track of the maximum happiness found.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int maximizeHappiness(std::vector<int>& children, int initial_happiness) {
    int max_happiness = initial_happiness;
    int n = children.size();
    
    // Generate all possible subsets
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        int happiness = initial_happiness;
        int count = 0;
        
        // Calculate happiness for the current subset
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                happiness += children[i];
                count++;
            } else {
                happiness--;
            }
        }
        
        // Update maximum happiness
        max_happiness = std::max(max_happiness, happiness);
    }
    
    return max_happiness;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of children. The reason is that we generate all possible subsets ( $2^n$ ) and for each subset, we calculate the happiness in $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum happiness and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has an exponential time complexity due to generating all possible subsets, which makes it inefficient for large inputs.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a greedy approach, selecting children with the highest happiness first.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Sort the children in descending order of their happiness.
  2. Initialize the maximum happiness with the initial happiness.
  3. Iterate through the sorted children and select them one by one, updating the maximum happiness.
  4. If selecting a child would decrease the happiness, stop selecting children.

```cpp
int maximizeHappiness(std::vector<int>& children, int initial_happiness) {
    std::sort(children.begin(), children.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int max_happiness = initial_happiness;
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int child : children) {
        if (child > 1) {
            max_happiness += child - 1;
            count++;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return max_happiness;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of children. The reason is that we sort the children in $O(n \log n)$ time and then iterate through them in $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum happiness and other variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** The greedy approach is optimal because selecting children with the highest happiness first maximizes the overall happiness. If selecting a child would decrease the happiness, it's better to stop selecting children.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: greedy approach, sorting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: selecting the best option first, stopping when the solution becomes worse.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a greedy approach to avoid unnecessary calculations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking for edge cases, such as an empty input list.
- Edge cases to watch for: handling cases where the initial happiness is negative or the input list is empty.
- Performance pitfalls: using an inefficient algorithm, such as the brute force approach, for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
