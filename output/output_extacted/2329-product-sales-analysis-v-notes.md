## Product Sales Analysis V
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/product-sales-analysis-v/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: The input is a table `Sales` with columns `sale_id`, `product_id`, `sale_date`, and `quantity`, and a table `Product` with columns `product_id`, `product_name`.
- Expected output format: A table with `product_name`, `sale_date`, `quantity`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The output should contain the product name, sale date, and quantity.
  - The output should be ordered by `sale_date`, then by `product_name`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For example, if the `Sales` table contains a row with `sale_id` = 1, `product_id` = 1, `sale_date` = '2020-01-01', and `quantity` = 10, and the `Product` table contains a row with `product_id` = 1 and `product_name` = 'Product A', the output should contain a row with `product_name` = 'Product A', `sale_date` = '2020-01-01', and `quantity` = 10.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The problem can be solved by simply joining the `Sales` and `Product` tables on the `product_id` column and selecting the required columns.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Join the `Sales` and `Product` tables on the `product_id` column.
  2. Select the `product_name`, `sale_date`, and `quantity` columns.
  3. Order the result by `sale_date` and then by `product_name`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This is a straightforward approach that directly addresses the requirements of the problem.

```cpp
// SQL query
SELECT P.product_name, S.sale_date, S.quantity
FROM Sales S
JOIN Product P ON S.product_id = P.product_id
ORDER BY S.sale_date, P.product_name;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting operation, where $n$ is the number of rows in the result.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the result, where $n$ is the number of rows in the result.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because the database needs to sort the result, and the space complexity occurs because the database needs to store the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using a single SQL query with a join and an order by clause.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Join the `Sales` and `Product` tables on the `product_id` column.
  2. Select the `product_name`, `sale_date`, and `quantity` columns.
  3. Order the result by `sale_date` and then by `product_name`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly addresses the requirements of the problem and does not involve any unnecessary operations.

```cpp
// SQL query
SELECT P.product_name, S.sale_date, S.quantity
FROM Sales S
JOIN Product P ON S.product_id = P.product_id
ORDER BY S.sale_date, P.product_name;
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the result, where $n$ is the number of rows in the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly addresses the requirements of the problem and does not involve any unnecessary operations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Joining tables, selecting columns, ordering results.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Directly addressing the requirements of the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary operations.
