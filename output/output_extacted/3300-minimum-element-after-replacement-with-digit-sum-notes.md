## Minimum Element After Replacement With Digit Sum

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-element-after-replacement-with-digit-sum/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a positive integer `n`, replace each digit of `n` with the sum of its digits, and repeat this process until the resulting number has only one digit. Return the minimum possible number that can be obtained after this process.
- Expected output format: A single integer representing the minimum possible number.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input `n` will be a positive integer, and the process should continue until a single digit is obtained.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `n = 38`, the process would be `38 -> 11 -> 2`, so the minimum possible number is `2`.
  - For `n = 55`, the process would be `55 -> 10 -> 1`, so the minimum possible number is `1`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to repeatedly replace each digit of `n` with the sum of its digits until a single digit is obtained.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start with the input number `n`.
  2. Calculate the sum of the digits of `n`.
  3. Replace `n` with the sum of its digits.
  4. Repeat steps 2-3 until `n` is a single digit.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the problem statement and does not require any additional insights.

```cpp
int minimumElementAfterReplacementWithDigitSum(int n) {
    while (n >= 10) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        n = sum;
    }
    return n;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(log(n) \cdot log(n))$ because in the worst case, we are replacing each digit with its sum in each iteration, and the number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in `n`, which is $log(n)$. The inner while loop also runs $log(n)$ times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the repeated replacement of digits with their sums, and the space complexity is due to the use of a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The process of replacing each digit with the sum of its digits until a single digit is obtained can be optimized by directly calculating the final single digit without needing to perform the replacement process iteratively.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the digital root of `n`, which is the recursive sum of all the digits in the number until we get a single-digit number.
  2. The digital root is the minimum possible number that can be obtained after the replacement process.
- Proof of optimality: The digital root is the smallest possible single-digit number that can be obtained from `n` by repeatedly replacing each digit with the sum of its digits.

```cpp
int minimumElementAfterReplacementWithDigitSum(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    return (n - 1) % 9 + 1;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we directly calculate the digital root using a mathematical formula.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** The digital root is the smallest possible single-digit number that can be obtained from `n` by repeatedly replacing each digit with the sum of its digits, so this approach is optimal.
