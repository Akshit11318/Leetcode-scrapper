## Hopper Company Queries II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/hopper-company-queries-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums` representing the number of beds available at each location, and a 2D array `queries` containing three integers: `start`, `end`, and `size`, representing the start and end locations and the size of the query, respectively.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= start <= end <= nums.length`, and `1 <= size <= end - start + 1`.
- Expected output format: An array of integers representing the maximum number of beds that can be allocated for each query.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The `start` and `end` indices are 1-based.
  - The `size` parameter represents the number of locations to consider for the query.
  - The goal is to maximize the number of beds allocated for each query.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `queries = [[1, 3, 2], [2, 4, 3]]`
  - Output: `[6, 12]`
  - Explanation: For the first query, the maximum number of beds that can be allocated is `1 + 5 = 6`. For the second query, the maximum number of beds that can be allocated is `3 + 7 + 9 = 19`, but since the size is 3, we can only allocate `3 + 7 + 2 = 12` beds.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate over each query and calculate the maximum number of beds that can be allocated by considering all possible combinations of locations within the query range.
- For each query, we iterate over the locations from `start` to `end` and calculate the sum of beds at each location. We keep track of the maximum sum seen so far.

```cpp
vector<int> maxBeds(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = query[0] - 1; i <= query[1] - 1; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < i + query[2]; j++) {
                if (j >= nums.size()) break;
                sum += nums[j];
            }
            maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
        }
        result.push_back(maxSum);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(q \cdot n \cdot s)$, where $q$ is the number of queries, $n$ is the number of locations, and $s$ is the maximum size of a query.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(q)$, where $q$ is the number of queries.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity due to the nested loops that iterate over each query, location, and size. The space complexity is relatively low since we only need to store the result for each query.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is to use a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum number of beds that can be allocated for each query.
- We maintain a window of size `query[2]` and slide it over the locations from `query[0]` to `query[1]`. At each position, we calculate the sum of beds within the window and update the maximum sum seen so far.

```cpp
vector<int> maxBeds(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = query[0] - 1; i <= query[1] - query[2]; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < i + query[2]; j++) {
                sum += nums[j];
            }
            maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
        }
        result.push_back(maxSum);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(q \cdot n)$, where $q$ is the number of queries and $n$ is the number of locations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(q)$, where $q$ is the number of queries.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach has a lower time complexity compared to the brute force approach since we only need to iterate over each query and location once. The space complexity remains the same.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: sliding window approach, optimization techniques.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: iterating over queries and locations, calculating sums and maximum values.
- Optimization techniques learned: reducing the number of iterations, using a sliding window approach.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: incorrect indexing, incorrect calculation of sums and maximum values.
- Edge cases to watch for: queries with size 1, queries with start and end indices equal to 1.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach, not optimizing the iteration over queries and locations.
- Testing considerations: testing with different input sizes, testing with different query sizes and locations.
