## Minimum Number of Seconds to Make Mountain Height Zero

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-seconds-to-make-mountain-height-zero/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an integer array `nums` representing the heights of mountains, where `nums[i]` denotes the height of the `i-th` mountain.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to make all mountain heights zero.
- In each second, you can reduce the height of any mountain by one unit.

**Expected Output Format:**
- The minimum number of seconds required to make all mountain heights zero.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases to Consider:**
- The input array `nums` is non-empty and contains only non-negative integers.
- The length of the input array `nums` is at most `10^5`.
- The maximum possible height of a mountain is `10^6`.

**Example Test Cases with Explanations:**
- Input: `nums = [2,3,1,0]`
  Output: `2`
  Explanation: We can make all mountain heights zero in two seconds by reducing the heights of the first two mountains.
- Input: `nums = [0,1,0]`
  Output: `1`
  Explanation: We can make all mountain heights zero in one second by reducing the height of the second mountain.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to simply calculate the maximum height of all mountains and return it as the minimum number of seconds required.
- This approach is straightforward and comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSeconds(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_height = 0;
        for (int height : nums) {
            max_height = max(max_height, height);
        }
        return max_height;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of mountains. This is because we need to iterate through the input array once to find the maximum height.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum height.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we need to examine each mountain height once, and the space complexity is constant because we only need to store a single variable.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is that the minimum number of seconds required to make all mountain heights zero is equal to the maximum height of all mountains.
- This is because we can reduce the height of any mountain by one unit in each second, so the maximum height determines the minimum number of seconds required.
- The optimal solution is identical to the brute force approach, as the problem statement directly leads to the conclusion that the maximum height is the minimum number of seconds required.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSeconds(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_height = 0;
        for (int height : nums) {
            max_height = max(max_height, height);
        }
        return max_height;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of mountains.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum height.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it directly addresses the problem statement and has a linear time complexity, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The key algorithmic concept demonstrated in this problem is the use of a simple iteration to find the maximum value in an array.
- The problem-solving pattern identified in this problem is the direct application of the problem statement to find the solution.
- The optimization technique learned in this problem is the recognition that the maximum height of all mountains determines the minimum number of seconds required.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- A common implementation error is to use an incorrect data structure or algorithm, such as using a sorting algorithm to find the maximum height.
- An edge case to watch for is an empty input array, which should be handled explicitly.
- A performance pitfall is to use an inefficient algorithm with a higher time complexity, such as using a recursive function to find the maximum height.
- A testing consideration is to test the solution with a variety of input arrays, including edge cases such as an empty array or an array with a single element.
