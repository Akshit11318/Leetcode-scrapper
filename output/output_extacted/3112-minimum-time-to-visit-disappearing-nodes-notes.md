## Minimum Time to Visit Disappearing Nodes

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-visit-disappearing-nodes/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: `n` nodes, `edges` list of pairs, and `disappearing` list of integers representing the time each node disappears.
- Constraints: `2 <= n <= 10^4`, `1 <= edges.length <= 2 * 10^4`, `disappearing.length == n`.
- Expected output format: The minimum time to visit all nodes before they disappear.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Each node can only be visited once, and the graph may not be connected.
- Example test cases with explanations: The provided test cases demonstrate how the solution should handle different graph structures and disappearance times.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible orders of visiting the nodes and calculate the time taken for each order.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of the nodes.
  2. For each permutation, calculate the time taken to visit each node before it disappears.
  3. Keep track of the minimum time found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward, albeit inefficient, way to solve the problem by considering all possible solutions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minTimeToVisitAllNodes(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& disappearing) {
    // Generate all permutations of the nodes
    vector<int> nodes(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        nodes[i] = i;
    }

    int minTime = INT_MAX;
    do {
        int currentTime = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Check if the current node can be visited before it disappears
            if (currentTime > disappearing[nodes[i]]) {
                break;
            }
            currentTime++;
        }
        // Update the minimum time if all nodes can be visited before they disappear
        if (currentTime == n) {
            minTime = min(minTime, currentTime);
        }
    } while (next_permutation(nodes.begin(), nodes.end()));

    return minTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes. This is because we generate all permutations of the nodes.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes. This is because we need to store the current permutation of nodes.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has an exponential time complexity due to the generation of all permutations, making it impractical for large inputs.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes that can be visited next, along with their disappearance times.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a priority queue to store the nodes that can be visited next, along with their disappearance times.
  2. Initialize the current time to 0.
  3. While there are still nodes to visit, extract the node with the earliest disappearance time from the priority queue.
  4. If the current time is less than or equal to the disappearance time of the extracted node, visit the node and increment the current time.
  5. Otherwise, increment the current time to the disappearance time of the extracted node and visit the node.
- Proof of optimality: The priority queue ensures that we always visit the node with the earliest disappearance time next, which minimizes the total time taken to visit all nodes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int minTimeToVisitAllNodes(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& disappearing) {
    // Create a priority queue to store the nodes that can be visited next
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;

    // Initialize the current time to 0
    int currentTime = 0;

    // Add all nodes to the priority queue
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        pq.push({disappearing[i], i});
    }

    // Visit nodes until the priority queue is empty
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        int disappearanceTime = pq.top().first;
        int node = pq.top().second;
        pq.pop();

        // Visit the node if the current time is less than or equal to the disappearance time
        if (currentTime <= disappearanceTime) {
            currentTime++;
        } else {
            // Otherwise, increment the current time to the disappearance time
            currentTime = disappearanceTime + 1;
        }
    }

    return currentTime;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Priority queues, greedy algorithms.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using priority queues to keep track of the next node to visit.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minimizing the total time taken to visit all nodes by visiting the node with the earliest disappearance time next.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving priority queues and greedy algorithms.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases correctly, such as when the input graph is empty.
- Edge cases to watch for: When the input graph is disconnected, or when there are multiple nodes with the same disappearance time.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient data structure, such as a vector or array, to store the nodes instead of a priority queue.
- Testing considerations: Test the solution with different input graphs, including empty graphs, disconnected graphs, and graphs with multiple nodes having the same disappearance time.
