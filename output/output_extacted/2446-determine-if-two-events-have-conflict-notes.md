## Determine if Two Events Have Conflict
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-events-have-conflict/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes two events as input, each represented by a start time and an end time. The task is to determine if these two events conflict with each other.
- Expected output format: The function should return `true` if the events conflict and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - Events are represented by start and end times.
    - Two events conflict if they overlap in time.
    - Consider edge cases where events start or end at the same time.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Event 1: [1, 2], Event 2: [2, 3] -> No conflict because they do not overlap.
- Event 1: [1, 3], Event 2: [2, 4] -> Conflict because they overlap.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to compare the start and end times of both events to determine if they overlap.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
    1. Compare the start time of Event 1 with the end time of Event 2.
    2. Compare the start time of Event 2 with the end time of Event 1.
    3. If either condition is true, it means the events do not conflict.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the definition of a conflict between two time intervals.

```cpp
bool haveConflict(vector<string>& event1, vector<string>& event2) {
    // Convert times to minutes for easier comparison
    int start1 = stoi(event1[0].substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(event1[0].substr(3, 2));
    int end1 = stoi(event1[1].substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(event1[1].substr(3, 2));
    int start2 = stoi(event2[0].substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(event2[0].substr(3, 2));
    int end2 = stoi(event2[1].substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(event2[1].substr(3, 2));

    // Check for conflict
    return !(end1 < start2 || end2 < start1);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we perform a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we use a constant amount of space to store the start and end times of the events.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The operations are straightforward and do not depend on the size of the input, leading to constant time and space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is that two events conflict if and only if the end time of one event is greater than or equal to the start time of the other event.
- Detailed breakdown:
    1. Convert the times to a comparable format (e.g., minutes).
    2. Apply the conflict condition directly.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly checks the condition for conflict without any unnecessary steps or comparisons.

```cpp
bool haveConflict(vector<string>& event1, vector<string>& event2) {
    int start1 = stoi(event1[0].substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(event1[0].substr(3, 2));
    int end1 = stoi(event1[1].substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(event1[1].substr(3, 2));
    int start2 = stoi(event2[0].substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(event2[0].substr(3, 2));
    int end2 = stoi(event2[1].substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(event2[1].substr(3, 2));

    return !(end1 < start2 || end2 < start1);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the number of operations is constant.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most direct way to check for conflicts between two time intervals, making it the optimal approach.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Direct comparison and conversion of time formats for easier comparison.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into simpler conditions (start and end times) to determine the outcome.
- Optimization techniques learned: Simplifying the comparison by converting times to a common format.
- Similar problems to practice: Other interval-related problems, such as finding overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling the conversion of time formats or misunderstanding the conflict condition.
- Edge cases to watch for: Events starting or ending at the same time, or events with the same start and end times.
- Performance pitfalls: Unnecessarily complex comparisons or using inefficient data structures.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various start and end times, including edge cases like events starting or ending at the same time.
