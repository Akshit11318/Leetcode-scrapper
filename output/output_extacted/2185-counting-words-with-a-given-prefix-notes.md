## Counting Words with a Given Prefix

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-words-with-a-given-prefix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of strings `words` and a string `prefix`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq \text{length of each word} \leq 50$, $1 \leq \text{number of words} \leq 100$, and $1 \leq \text{length of prefix} \leq 50$.
- Expected output format: The number of words in the `words` array that start with the given `prefix`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The input array may contain duplicate words.
  - The input array may be empty.
  - The prefix may be longer than the words in the array.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `words = ["pay","attention","practice","attack"], prefix = "at"` should return 2 because "attention" and "attack" start with the prefix "at".
  - `words = ["leetcode","code","leet","co"], prefix = "leet"` should return 2 because "leetcode" and "leet" start with the prefix "leet".

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over each word in the `words` array and check if it starts with the given `prefix`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a counter variable `count` to 0.
  2. Iterate over each word in the `words` array.
  3. For each word, check if it starts with the given `prefix` using the `startswith()` method.
  4. If the word starts with the `prefix`, increment the `count` variable.
  5. After iterating over all words, return the `count` variable.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive solution that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
int countWords(vector<string>& words, string prefix) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& word : words) {
        if (word.find(prefix) == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the number of words and $m$ is the maximum length of a word. This is because we are iterating over each word and checking if it starts with the prefix, which takes $O(m)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the count variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating over each word and performing a string operation (checking if it starts with the prefix) for each word. The space complexity occurs because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the count variable.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the same approach as the brute force solution because it is already optimal. The problem requires us to iterate over each word and check if it starts with the prefix, which takes $O(m)$ time for each word.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach is the same as the brute force approach.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot m)$, which is the minimum time complexity required to solve this problem. We must iterate over each word and check if it starts with the prefix, which takes $O(m)$ time for each word.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must iterate over each word and check if it starts with the prefix. This operation takes $O(m)$ time for each word, and we cannot reduce this time complexity.

```cpp
int countWords(vector<string>& words, string prefix) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& word : words) {
        if (word.find(prefix) == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration over arrays and string operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking if a string starts with a prefix.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the brute force solution is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation problems, such as checking if a string is a substring of another string.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to initialize the count variable or not checking if the word starts with the prefix correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input arrays or prefixes that are longer than the words in the array.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient string operations or iterating over the array unnecessarily.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input arrays and prefixes to ensure it works correctly.
