## Multiply Strings
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two non-negative integers represented as strings `num1` and `num2`.
- Constraints: $0 \leq num1, num2 \leq 10^9$.
- Expected output format: The product of `num1` and `num2` as a string.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling zero inputs.
  - Dealing with very large numbers that may exceed integer limits.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `num1 = "123", num2 = "456"` should return `"56088"`.
  - `num1 = "0", num2 = "123"` should return `"0"`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Convert the input strings to integers, multiply them, and then convert the result back to a string.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Convert `num1` and `num2` to integers.
  2. Multiply the two integers.
  3. Convert the product back to a string.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's the most straightforward way to multiply two numbers, but it doesn't account for the potential overflow when dealing with large numbers.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string multiply(string num1, string num2) {
        // Convert strings to integers
        long long num1Int = stoll(num1);
        long long num2Int = stoll(num2);
        
        // Multiply the integers
        long long product = num1Int * num2Int;
        
        // Convert the product back to a string
        return to_string(product);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `num1` and `num2` respectively, due to the conversion operations. However, the multiplication operation itself is $O(1)$ for integers, but considering the conversion, it's $O(n + m)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ for storing the result.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The conversion between strings and integers dominates the time complexity, while the space complexity is due to storing the input strings and the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Since the input numbers are represented as strings, we can perform the multiplication digit by digit, similar to how we do manual multiplication.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an array to store the digits of the result.
  2. Iterate through each digit of `num1` and `num2`, multiplying them and adding the result to the corresponding position in the array.
  3. Handle carry-over values.
  4. Convert the array of digits back to a string.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot m)$, which is the best we can achieve for multiplying two numbers represented as strings, since we must examine each digit at least once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string multiply(string num1, string num2) {
        int n = num1.size(), m = num2.size();
        vector<int> pos(n + m, 0);
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                int mul = (num1[i] - '0') * (num2[j] - '0');
                int p1 = i + j, p2 = i + j + 1;
                int sum = mul + pos[p2];
                
                pos[p1] += sum / 10;
                pos[p2] = sum % 10;
            }
        }
        
        string res;
        for (int value : pos) if (!(res.size() == 0 && value == 0)) res += to_string(value);
        return res.size() == 0 ? "0" : res;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `num1` and `num2` respectively, due to the nested loop structure.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ for storing the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it must examine each digit of the input numbers at least once to perform the multiplication, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n \cdot m)$.
