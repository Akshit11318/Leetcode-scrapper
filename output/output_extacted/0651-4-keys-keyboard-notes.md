## 4-Keys Keyboard
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/4-keys-keyboard/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `n`, the maximum number of characters in the string.
- Output: The maximum number of `A`s that can be printed in `n` operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The four allowed operations are `A` (append `A`), `Ctrl+A` (select all), `Ctrl+C` (copy selected), and `Ctrl+V` (paste).
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `n = 3`, the maximum is 3 by typing `A` three times.
  - For `n = 7`, the maximum is 9 by typing `A` twice, then `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`, and `Ctrl+V` twice.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of operations and track the maximum number of `A`s that can be printed.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `max_A` to store the maximum number of `A`s that can be printed.
  2. For each possible number of operations from 1 to `n`, generate all possible combinations of operations.
  3. For each combination, simulate the operations and update `max_A` if the current combination results in more `A`s.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to ensure all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
int maxA(int n) {
    int max_A = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // Generate all possible combinations of operations
        // Simulate each combination and update max_A
        // This part is omitted for brevity as it involves complex recursive or iterative approaches
        // to generate and simulate all combinations, which would be highly inefficient.
    }
    return max_A;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(4^n)$, because there are 4 possible operations for each of the `n` steps, leading to an exponential number of combinations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the current combination of operations and the maximum number of `A`s found so far.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates and simulates all possible combinations of operations, leading to exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal strategy involves using `Ctrl+A` and `Ctrl+C` once to copy all the `A`s typed so far, and then using `Ctrl+V` to paste them in the remaining operations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Type `A` until there are enough operations left to perform `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`, and at least one `Ctrl+V`. This means typing `A` for `i` operations, where `i` is the number of operations that allows for the maximum number of `A`s to be printed after copying and pasting.
  2. Perform `Ctrl+A` and `Ctrl+C` to copy the `A`s typed so far.
  3. Use the remaining operations to perform `Ctrl+V`, pasting the copied `A`s.
- Proof of optimality: This approach maximizes the number of `A`s printed because it utilizes the copying and pasting operations to exponentially increase the number of `A`s in the fewest operations.

```cpp
int maxA(int n) {
    if (n <= 3) return n; // Base case for small n
    int max_A = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n - 3; i++) { // i is the number of A's typed before copying
        int remainingOps = n - i - 2; // Remaining operations after typing A's, Ctrl+A, and Ctrl+C
        int total_A = i + i * remainingOps; // Total A's after copying and pasting
        max_A = max(max_A, total_A);
    }
    return max_A;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we are iterating through possible values of `i` from 1 to `n-3`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it maximizes the utilization of the `Ctrl+V` operation, which is the key to exponentially increasing the number of `A`s printed.
