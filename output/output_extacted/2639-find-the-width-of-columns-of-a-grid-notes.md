## Find the Width of Columns of a Grid
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-width-of-columns-of-a-grid/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D array `grid` where each cell is a string.
- Constraints: The number of rows in the grid is in the range `[1, 100]`, and the number of columns is in the range `[1, 100]`. Each string is of length at most 100.
- Expected output format: An array of integers where the `i`-th integer is the width of the `i`-th column.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The width of a column is the maximum length of any string in that column. Empty strings should be considered as having a length of 0.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over each column and find the maximum length of any string in that column.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an array to store the width of each column.
  2. Iterate over each column in the grid.
  3. For each column, iterate over each row and find the maximum length of any string in that column.
  4. Store the maximum length in the width array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by checking every string in every column.

```cpp
vector<int> findColumnWidth(vector<vector<string>>& grid) {
    int cols = grid[0].size();
    vector<int> widths(cols, 0);
    for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {
        for (int row = 0; row < grid.size(); row++) {
            widths[col] = max(widths[col], (int)grid[row][col].size());
        }
    }
    return widths;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \times n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. This is because we are iterating over each cell in the grid once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of columns. This is because we are storing the width of each column in an array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear with respect to the total number of cells in the grid because we visit each cell once. The space complexity is linear with respect to the number of columns because we need to store the width of each column.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal because we must examine each cell at least once to determine the maximum length in each column.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: Same as the brute force approach.
- Proof of optimality: Any algorithm must examine each cell at least once to determine the width of each column, so the time complexity cannot be improved beyond $O(m \times n)$.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We must check every cell to ensure we find the maximum length in each column, making the brute force approach optimal.

```cpp
vector<int> findColumnWidth(vector<vector<string>>& grid) {
    int cols = grid[0].size();
    vector<int> widths(cols, 0);
    for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {
        for (int row = 0; row < grid.size(); row++) {
            widths[col] = max(widths[col], (int)grid[row][col].size());
        }
    }
    return widths;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \times n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of columns.
> - **Optimality proof:** Since we must examine each cell at least once, the time complexity of $O(m \times n)$ is optimal.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration over a 2D array, use of `max` function to find the maximum value.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The need to examine each element in a data structure when searching for maximum or minimum values.
- Optimization techniques learned: Recognizing when a brute force approach is optimal due to the necessity of examining each element.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the maximum or minimum value in a 2D array, counting occurrences of a specific value in a 2D array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to initialize variables, incorrect iteration bounds.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty strings, empty grid.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient data structures or algorithms for larger inputs.
- Testing considerations: Test with grids of varying sizes, including edge cases like empty grids or grids with only one row or column.
