## Remove Comments
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-comments/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of strings `source` representing the source code of a program, remove all comments from the source code. A comment can start with `//` or `/*` and end with `*/` or the end of the line.
- Expected output format: Return the source code with all comments removed.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - `//` comments can appear anywhere in the code and continue until the end of the line.
  - `/*` comments can appear anywhere in the code and continue until `*/` is encountered.
  - Nested comments are not allowed.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `source = ["a/*b*/c", "bl/*/*ab*/b"]` should return `["a/*b*/c", "bl/*/*ab*/b"]`.
  - `source = ["a//b/c", "bl/*ab*/b"]` should return `["a", "bl/*ab*/b"]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Read each line of the source code and check for comments.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each line in the source code.
  2. Check for `//` comments and remove the rest of the line if found.
  3. Check for `/*` comments and remove everything until `*/` is found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's the most straightforward way to solve the problem by directly checking for comments in each line.

```cpp
vector<string> removeComments(vector<string>& source) {
    vector<string> result;
    string temp = "";
    bool blockComment = false;
    
    for (string line : source) {
        for (int i = 0; i < line.size(); i++) {
            if (blockComment) {
                if (line.substr(i, 2) == "*/") {
                    blockComment = false;
                    i++;
                }
            } else {
                if (line.substr(i, 2) == "//") break;
                else if (line.substr(i, 2) == "/*") {
                    blockComment = true;
                    i++;
                } else temp += line[i];
            }
        }
        
        if (!blockComment && !temp.empty()) {
            result.push_back(temp);
            temp = "";
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the number of lines and $m$ is the average length of a line. This is because we are iterating through each character in each line.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ for storing the result. This is because in the worst case, we might have to store all characters from the input.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking every character in every line for comments, which leads to the time complexity. The space complexity comes from storing the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can iterate through the source code character by character and maintain a flag for whether we are currently inside a block comment.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty result string and a flag for block comments.
  2. Iterate through each character in the source code.
  3. If we encounter a `//` comment and are not in a block comment, we can skip the rest of the line.
  4. If we encounter a `/*` comment and are not in a block comment, we set the block comment flag to true.
  5. If we encounter a `*/` comment and are in a block comment, we set the block comment flag to false.
  6. If we are not in a block comment, we add the current character to the result.
- Proof of optimality: This approach still checks every character but does so in a single pass, making it optimal for this problem.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We must check every character at least once to determine if it is part of a comment or not.

```cpp
vector<string> removeComments(vector<string>& source) {
    vector<string> result;
    string temp = "";
    bool blockComment = false;
    
    for (string line : source) {
        for (int i = 0; i < line.size(); i++) {
            if (blockComment) {
                if (line.substr(i, 2) == "*/") {
                    blockComment = false;
                    i++;
                }
            } else {
                if (line.substr(i, 2) == "//") break;
                else if (line.substr(i, 2) == "/*") {
                    blockComment = true;
                    i++;
                } else temp += line[i];
            }
        }
        
        if (!blockComment && !temp.empty()) {
            result.push_back(temp);
            temp = "";
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, flag management, and string manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking for specific patterns in a string and handling different cases.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the number of passes through the data.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation and pattern recognition problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases correctly, such as nested comments or comments at the end of a line.
- Edge cases to watch for: Comments that start and end on the same line, comments that span multiple lines.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different types of comments and edge cases to ensure it works correctly.
