## Minimum Flips to Make a or b Equal to c
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-flips-to-make-a-or-b-equal-to-c/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, find the minimum number of flips required to make `a` or `b` equal to `c`. A flip operation involves changing a bit from 0 to 1 or vice versa.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of flips required.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The inputs are integers, and we need to consider all possible bit positions.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `a = 2`, `b = 6`, `c = 5`, the output should be `1` because we can flip the least significant bit of `a` to get `c`.
  - For `a = 4`, `b = 2`, `c = 4`, the output should be `0` because `a` is already equal to `c`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can start by comparing each bit of `a` and `b` with the corresponding bit of `c`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over all bits of the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
  2. For each bit position, count the number of flips required to make `a` or `b` equal to `c`.
  3. Return the minimum number of flips required.

```cpp
int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
    int flips = 0;
    while (a > 0 || b > 0 || c > 0) {
        int bitA = a & 1;
        int bitB = b & 1;
        int bitC = c & 1;

        // If bitC is 1, we need at least one of bitA or bitB to be 1
        if (bitC == 1) {
            if (bitA == 0 && bitB == 0) {
                flips++; // We need to flip one of bitA or bitB to 1
            }
        } else {
            // If bitC is 0, we need both bitA and bitB to be 0
            if (bitA == 1) {
                flips++; // We need to flip bitA to 0
            }
            if (bitB == 1) {
                flips++; // We need to flip bitB to 0
            }
        }

        a >>= 1;
        b >>= 1;
        c >>= 1;
    }
    return flips;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log \max(a, b, c))$ because we are iterating over the bits of the integers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are using a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the iteration over the bits of the integers, and the space complexity is due to the use of a constant amount of space to store the flips count.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved by iterating over the bits of the integers and counting the number of flips required to make `a` or `b` equal to `c`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate over all bits of the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
  2. For each bit position, count the number of flips required to make `a` or `b` equal to `c`.
  3. Return the minimum number of flips required.

```cpp
int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
    int flips = 0;
    while (a > 0 || b > 0 || c > 0) {
        int bitA = a & 1;
        int bitB = b & 1;
        int bitC = c & 1;

        // If bitC is 1, we need at least one of bitA or bitB to be 1
        if (bitC == 1) {
            if (bitA == 0 && bitB == 0) {
                flips++; // We need to flip one of bitA or bitB to 1
            }
        } else {
            // If bitC is 0, we need both bitA and bitB to be 0
            flips += bitA + bitB; // We need to flip bitA and bitB to 0
        }

        a >>= 1;
        b >>= 1;
        c >>= 1;
    }
    return flips;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because we need to iterate over all bits of the integers to count the number of flips required. The space complexity is optimal because we are using a constant amount of space to store the flips count.
