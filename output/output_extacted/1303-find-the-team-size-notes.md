## Find the Team Size
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-team-size/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D vector `scores` where each sub-array represents the scores of a team member in different skills.
- Constraints: Each sub-array contains at least one integer and at most 100 integers. The sum of the lengths of all sub-arrays does not exceed 10000. Each integer is between 1 and 100.
- Expected output format: The size of the team.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The team size is the number of team members, and we need to find this size given the scores of each team member.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We need to count the number of team members. Since each sub-array represents a team member, we can simply count the number of sub-arrays.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `team_size` to 0.
  2. Iterate through the `scores` vector and increment `team_size` by 1 for each sub-array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward and intuitive solution that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
int findTeamSize(vector<vector<int>>& scores) {
    int team_size = 0;
    for (auto& score : scores) {
        team_size++;
    }
    return team_size;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of team members. This is because we iterate through the `scores` vector once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `team_size` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a constant amount of work for each team member, and the space complexity is constant because we don't use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can directly return the size of the `scores` vector, as it represents the number of team members.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Return the size of the `scores` vector using the `size()` function.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it has a constant time complexity, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
int findTeamSize(vector<vector<int>>& scores) {
    return scores.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we simply return the size of the `scores` vector, which is a constant time operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we don't use any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it has the best possible time complexity, and we can't improve it further.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, counting, and vector operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Directly addressing the problem statement and using built-in functions to simplify the solution.
