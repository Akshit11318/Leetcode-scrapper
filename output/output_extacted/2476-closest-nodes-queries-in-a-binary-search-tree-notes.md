## Closest Nodes Queries in a Binary Search Tree

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-nodes-queries-in-a-binary-search-tree/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: The root of a `binary search tree` and an array `queries`.
- Constraints: The number of nodes in the tree is at most `1000`, and the number of queries is at most `1000`.
- Expected output format: For each query, return the closest values in the binary search tree, ordered from smallest to largest.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling duplicate values, ensuring correct ordering of results, and managing query values that are not present in the tree.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - A sample binary search tree and a set of queries to demonstrate how the solution should work.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each query, traverse the binary search tree to find the closest values.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Traverse the binary search tree to find the closest values for each query.
  2. For each query, maintain a list of closest values.
  3. Ensure the list is ordered from smallest to largest.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to solve the problem, but it's not efficient due to the repeated traversal of the tree for each query.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> closestNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& queries) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    for (int query : queries) {
        vector<int> closest;
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        traverse(root, query, closest, minDiff);
        sort(closest.begin(), closest.end());
        result.push_back(closest);
    }
    return result;
}

void traverse(TreeNode* node, int query, vector<int>& closest, int& minDiff) {
    if (!node) return;
    int diff = abs(node->val - query);
    if (diff < minDiff) {
        minDiff = diff;
        closest.clear();
        closest.push_back(node->val);
    } else if (diff == minDiff) {
        closest.push_back(node->val);
    }
    traverse(node->left, query, closest, minDiff);
    traverse(node->right, query, closest, minDiff);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot q \cdot h)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree, $q$ is the number of queries, and $h$ is the height of the tree. This is because for each query, we potentially traverse the entire tree.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + q)$, for storing the results and the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves a lot of repeated work, as we traverse the tree for each query, leading to high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree to obtain a sorted array of node values. Then, for each query, we can use binary search to find the closest values in the sorted array.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree to get a sorted array of node values.
  2. For each query, use binary search to find the closest values in the sorted array.
- Proof of optimality: This approach minimizes the time complexity by avoiding repeated traversal of the tree for each query and utilizing efficient binary search for queries.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> closestNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& queries) {
    vector<int> inorder;
    traverseInorder(root, inorder);
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    for (int query : queries) {
        vector<int> closest;
        int idx = lower_bound(inorder.begin(), inorder.end(), query) - inorder.begin();
        if (idx > 0 && (idx == inorder.size() || query - inorder[idx - 1] <= inorder[idx] - query)) {
            closest.push_back(inorder[idx - 1]);
        }
        if (idx < inorder.size()) {
            if (closest.empty() || inorder[idx] - query < query - closest[0]) {
                closest.clear();
                closest.push_back(inorder[idx]);
            } else if (inorder[idx] - query == query - closest[0]) {
                closest.push_back(inorder[idx]);
            }
        }
        result.push_back(closest);
    }
    return result;
}

void traverseInorder(TreeNode* node, vector<int>& inorder) {
    if (!node) return;
    traverseInorder(node->left, inorder);
    inorder.push_back(node->val);
    traverseInorder(node->right, inorder);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + q \cdot \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree and $q$ is the number of queries. This is because we perform a single traversal of the tree and then use binary search for each query.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + q)$, for storing the in-order traversal result and the query results.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to find the closest values for each query by leveraging the structure of the binary search tree and efficient binary search.
