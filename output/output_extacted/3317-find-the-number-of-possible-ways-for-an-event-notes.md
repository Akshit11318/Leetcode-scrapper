## Find the Number of Possible Ways for an Event

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-possible-ways-for-an-event/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer `n` representing the number of people, and an integer `k` representing the number of groups.
- Constraints: `1 <= k <= n <= 1000`.
- Expected output format: The number of ways to divide `n` people into `k` groups.
- Key requirements: The order of groups does not matter, and each person must be in exactly one group.
- Edge cases: When `k` is 1 or `n`, there is only one way to divide the people.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible combinations of groups and count the valid ones.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a counter for valid combinations.
  2. Generate all possible combinations of groups using recursion or iteration.
  3. For each combination, check if it satisfies the condition of having `k` groups.
  4. If it does, increment the counter.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to ensure all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int countWays(int n, int k) {
    if (k == 1 || k == n) return 1; // Base cases
    int count = 0;
    // Generate all possible combinations and count valid ones
    // This can be implemented using recursion or iteration
    // For simplicity and due to the complexity of manually generating all combinations,
    // we acknowledge that this step involves significant computational effort and is not efficient.
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, as we generate all possible subsets of people.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the current combination.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates an exponential number of combinations, leading to high time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the need to store the current combination being considered.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The problem can be solved using the concept of `Stirling numbers of the second kind`, denoted as $S(n, k)$, which counts the number of ways to partition a set of `n` objects into `k` non-empty subsets.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use the formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind: $S(n, k) = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i \binom{k}{i} (k-i)^n$.
  2. Implement this formula in code to calculate $S(n, k)$.
- Proof of optimality: This approach directly calculates the desired value without generating all combinations, making it much more efficient than the brute force method.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to calculate binomial coefficient
long long binomialCoefficient(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n - k) k = n - k;
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        result = result * (n - i) / (i + 1);
    }
    return result;
}

// Function to calculate Stirling number of the second kind
long long stirlingNumber(int n, int k) {
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= k; ++i) {
        sum += ((i % 2 == 0) ? 1 : -1) * binomialCoefficient(k, i) * pow(k - i, n);
    }
    return sum / factorial(k);
}

// Function to calculate factorial
long long factorial(int n) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    // Input values for n and k
    cout << stirlingNumber(n, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k^2)$, due to the loop in calculating $S(n, k)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of space is used.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach directly calculates the number of ways to divide `n` people into `k` groups using the formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind, making it optimal for this problem.
