## Find the Original Array of Prefix XOR
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-array-of-prefix-xor/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `changed` of length `n`, where `changed[i]` is the XOR of the first `i + 1` elements in the original array.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `0 <= changed[i] <= 10^7`.
- Expected Output: The original array of integers. If there are multiple valid original arrays, return any of them. If there is no valid original array, return an empty array.
- Key Requirements:
  - Understand the relationship between the `changed` array and the original array.
  - Use the properties of XOR operation to deduce the original array.
- Edge Cases:
  - When `n = 1`, the original array is simply `[changed[0]]`.
  - When `n > 1`, the XOR operation can be used to find the differences between consecutive elements in the `changed` array.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves understanding how the `changed` array is generated from the original array.
- We can start by assuming the original array is `[x1, x2, ..., xn]`.
- Then, `changed[0] = x1`, `changed[1] = x1 ^ x2`, and so on.
- However, directly computing the original array from the `changed` array using a brute force approach is not straightforward because of the XOR operation.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> findOriginalArray(std::vector<int>& changed) {
    int n = changed.size();
    // Initialize an empty vector to store the result
    std::vector<int> original;
    
    // Try all possible combinations to find the original array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int curr = changed[i];
        std::vector<int> temp;
        temp.push_back(curr);
        
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            int diff = curr ^ changed[j];
            temp.push_back(diff);
            curr = changed[j];
        }
        
        if (temp.size() == n) {
            original = temp;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return original;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the size of the `changed` array. This is because we are trying all possible combinations of elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the `changed` array. This is because we need to store the temporary results.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations, leading to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we only need to store the temporary results.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Since `changed[i] = original[0] ^ original[1] ^ ... ^ original[i]`, we can find `original[i]` by XORing `changed[i-1]` and `changed[i]`.
- We can use this property to iteratively find the original array.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> findOriginalArray(std::vector<int>& changed) {
    int n = changed.size();
    if (n % 2 == 1) return {};
    
    std::vector<int> original;
    original.push_back(changed[0]);
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        int curr = changed[i] ^ changed[i-1];
        original.push_back(curr);
    }
    
    return original;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the `changed` array. This is because we are iterating over the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the `changed` array. This is because we need to store the original array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are using the properties of the XOR operation to directly compute the original array. We cannot do better than linear time complexity because we need to at least read the input array once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: XOR operation, iterative computation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using properties of operations to simplify the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding brute force approaches, using properties of operations to reduce complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving XOR operations, such as finding the single number in an array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, not using the properties of operations correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `n` is odd, the original array does not exist.
- Performance pitfalls: Using brute force approaches, not optimizing the solution.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different inputs, including edge cases.
