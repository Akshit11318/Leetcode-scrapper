## Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-equivalent-string/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, and a string `baseStr`, find the lexicographically smallest equivalent string.
- `s1` and `s2` are equivalent if they have the same length and for every `i`, either `s1[i] == s2[i]` or `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are in the same equivalent group.
- The `baseStr` is used to determine the lexicographically smallest equivalent string.

**Expected Output Format:**
- Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases to Consider:**
- Handle cases where `s1` and `s2` have different lengths.
- Handle cases where `s1` and `s2` have the same length but are not equivalent.
- Handle cases where `baseStr` is empty.

**Example Test Cases with Explanations:**
- Example 1: `s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"` should return `"parser"`.
- Example 2: `s1 = "hello", s2 = "world", baseStr = "hold"` should return `"hold"`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate through each character in `s1` and `s2` and compare them.
- If the characters are the same, we can move on to the next character.
- If the characters are different, we need to check if they are in the same equivalent group.
- We can use a brute force approach to check all possible combinations of equivalent groups.

```cpp
class UnionFind {
public:
    vector<int> parent;
    UnionFind(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    void union_(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
        }
    }
};

string smallestEquivalentString(string s1, string s2, string baseStr) {
    UnionFind uf(26);
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); i++) {
        uf.union_(s1[i] - 'a', s2[i] - 'a');
    }
    string result;
    for (char c : baseStr) {
        result += 'a' + uf.find(c - 'a');
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ where $n$ is the length of `s1` and `s2`, and $m$ is the length of `baseStr`. The `find` and `union_` operations take $O(\alpha(n))$ time where $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ for the `parent` array in the `UnionFind` class.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the iteration through `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr`. The space complexity is dominated by the `parent` array in the `UnionFind` class.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach is to use a union-find data structure to keep track of the equivalent groups.
- We can use the `find` and `union_` operations to check if two characters are in the same equivalent group.
- We can iterate through `baseStr` and use the `find` operation to get the lexicographically smallest equivalent character.

```cpp
class UnionFind {
public:
    vector<int> parent;
    UnionFind(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    void union_(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
        }
    }
};

string smallestEquivalentString(string s1, string s2, string baseStr) {
    UnionFind uf(26);
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); i++) {
        uf.union_(s1[i] - 'a', s2[i] - 'a');
    }
    string result;
    for (char c : baseStr) {
        result += 'a' + uf.find(c - 'a');
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ for the `parent` array in the `UnionFind` class.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because we need to iterate through `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr` at least once. The space complexity is optimal because we need to store the `parent` array in the `UnionFind` class.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The union-find data structure is useful for keeping track of equivalent groups.
- The `find` and `union_` operations are essential for checking if two characters are in the same equivalent group.
- The optimal approach uses a union-find data structure to get the lexicographically smallest equivalent string.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not using a union-find data structure to keep track of equivalent groups.
- Not using the `find` and `union_` operations to check if two characters are in the same equivalent group.
- Not iterating through `baseStr` to get the lexicographically smallest equivalent string.
