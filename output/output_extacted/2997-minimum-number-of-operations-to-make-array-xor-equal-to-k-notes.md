## Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array XOR Equal to K

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-xor-equal-to-k/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Expected output: The minimum number of operations to make the XOR of all elements in `nums` equal to `k`. Each operation involves changing one element in `nums` to any value.
- Key requirements: 
  - The array `nums` contains integers.
  - The integer `k` is the target XOR value.
- Edge cases:
  - If `nums` is empty, return 0.
  - If `k` is 0, return 0 if the XOR of `nums` is already 0; otherwise, return the minimum number of operations to make the XOR of `nums` equal to 0.
- Example test cases:
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 4`, the minimum number of operations is 2 because we can change 1 to 4 and 2 to 0, making the XOR of `nums` equal to 4.
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 5`, the minimum number of operations is 1 because we can change 3 to 5, making the XOR of `nums` equal to 5.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves generating all possible combinations of changing elements in `nums`.
- We then calculate the XOR of each combination and check if it equals `k`.
- If we find a combination that makes the XOR equal to `k`, we count the number of changes made in that combination.
- We keep track of the minimum number of changes across all combinations that result in an XOR equal to `k`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        std::vector<int> temp = nums;
        int ops = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                // Change the element to make XOR equal to k
                temp[i] = k ^ std::accumulate(temp.begin(), temp.end(), 0, std::bit_xor<>());
                ops++;
            }
        }
        if (std::accumulate(temp.begin(), temp.end(), 0, std::bit_xor<>()) == k) {
            minOps = std::min(minOps, ops);
        }
    }
    return minOps == INT_MAX ? -1 : minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we generate all possible subsets of `nums` (each represented by a binary mask) and for each subset, we potentially change each element and calculate the XOR.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we create a temporary copy of `nums` for each subset.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible subsets of `nums` and for each subset, potentially changing each element and calculating the XOR, leading to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the temporary copy of `nums`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to calculate the XOR of all elements in `nums` first.
- Then, we calculate the XOR of `k` with the XOR of `nums`, which gives us the target XOR value that we need to achieve by changing elements in `nums`.
- We then use a greedy approach to change elements in `nums` to achieve the target XOR value.
- We prioritize changing elements that have the most significant impact on the XOR result.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int xorNums = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0, std::bit_xor<>());
    int targetXor = k ^ xorNums;
    if (targetXor == 0) return 0;
    
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << nums.size()); i++) {
        int ops = 0;
        int currXor = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                currXor ^= nums[j];
                ops++;
            }
        }
        if (currXor == targetXor) {
            minOps = std::min(minOps, ops);
        }
    }
    return minOps == INT_MAX ? -1 : minOps;
}
```

However, a better solution exists using bit manipulation to calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the XOR of `nums` equal to `k`.

```cpp
int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int xorNums = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0, std::bit_xor<>());
    int targetXor = k ^ xorNums;
    if (targetXor == 0) return 0;
    
    int minOps = 1;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if ((num ^ targetXor) < num) {
            return 1;
        }
    }
    return 2;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we calculate the XOR of all elements in `nums` and then iterate over `nums` to find the minimum number of operations required.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the XOR of `nums` and the target XOR value.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach is optimal because it uses a greedy strategy to find the minimum number of operations required to make the XOR of `nums` equal to `k`. It prioritizes changing elements that have the most significant impact on the XOR result, ensuring that the minimum number of operations is used.
