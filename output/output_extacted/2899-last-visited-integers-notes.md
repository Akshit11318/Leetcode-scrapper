## Last Visited Integers
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/last-visited-integers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array `A` of integers, and an integer `k`, return the `k` integers in the array that were visited last.
- Expected output format: The output should be an array of integers representing the last `k` visited integers.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The array `A` will have at least `k` elements.
  - The array `A` will not contain duplicate elements.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For example, given `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 2`, the output should be `[4, 5]`.
  - Given `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `[3, 4, 5]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward approach to solve this problem is to simply return the last `k` elements of the array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start from the end of the array.
  2. Select the last `k` elements.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by returning the last `k` integers in the array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> lastVisited(int k, vector<int>& A) {
        vector<int> result;
        for (int i = A.size() - k; i < A.size(); i++) {
            result.push_back(A[i]);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k)$ because we are iterating over the last `k` elements of the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$ because we are storing the last `k` elements in a new array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are directly accessing and copying the last `k` elements of the array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is essentially the same as the brute force approach because it directly addresses the problem statement with minimal operations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Use vector slicing or equivalent to directly extract the last `k` elements from the input array `A`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it achieves the required result with a single operation, minimizing both time and space complexity.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must at least read the last `k` elements once to return them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> lastVisited(int k, vector<int>& A) {
        return vector<int>(A.end() - k, A.end());
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k)$ because we are creating a new vector with the last `k` elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$ because we are storing the last `k` elements in a new vector.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we are performing the minimum necessary operations to achieve the result.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Direct array access and slicing.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires a straightforward extraction of a subset of elements based on their position.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using vector slicing to minimize operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving array or vector manipulation based on position or pattern.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect indexing or bounds checking.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `k` is larger than the array size (though the problem statement guarantees this won't happen).
- Performance pitfalls: Unnecessary iterations or data copies.
- Testing considerations: Ensure the solution works for various `k` values and array sizes.
