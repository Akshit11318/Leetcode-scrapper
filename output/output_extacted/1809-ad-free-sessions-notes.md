## Ad-Free Sessions
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/ad-free-sessions/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a 2D array `intervals` where each `intervals[i]` is of the form `[start_i, end_i]`, and an integer `k`, find the maximum number of ad-free sessions that can be watched. 
- Expected output format: The maximum number of ad-free sessions.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The sessions are non-overlapping, and the `k` minutes are considered ad-free if no ads are played during this time.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if `intervals = [[1,3],[3,5],[6,7],[8,11],[12,13]]` and `k = 2`, the maximum number of ad-free sessions is 3.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of sessions and check if the total ad-free time is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Generate all possible subsets of the given sessions.
    2. For each subset, calculate the total ad-free time by finding the maximum end time and minimum start time of the sessions in the subset.
    3. If the total ad-free time is greater than or equal to `k`, increment the count of ad-free sessions.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and tries all possible combinations of sessions.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxAdFreeSessions(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& intervals, int k) {
    int n = intervals.size();
    int maxSessions = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        int adFreeTime = 0;
        int maxEndTime = 0;
        int minStartTime = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                adFreeTime += intervals[i][1] - intervals[i][0];
                maxEndTime = std::max(maxEndTime, intervals[i][1]);
                minStartTime = std::min(minStartTime, intervals[i][0]);
            }
        }
        if (maxEndTime - minStartTime >= k) {
            maxSessions = std::max(maxSessions, __builtin_popcount(mask));
        }
    }
    return maxSessions;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of sessions. This is because we are generating all possible subsets of the sessions and for each subset, we are calculating the total ad-free time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are trying all possible combinations of sessions, and for each combination, we are calculating the total ad-free time. The space complexity is constant because we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a greedy approach to select the sessions with the maximum ad-free time.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Sort the sessions based on their end times.
    2. Initialize a variable to store the maximum ad-free sessions.
    3. Iterate over the sorted sessions and for each session, check if the current session does not overlap with the previously selected sessions.
    4. If the current session does not overlap, increment the count of ad-free sessions and update the end time of the previously selected sessions.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we are selecting the sessions with the maximum ad-free time and we are not considering any session that overlaps with the previously selected sessions.

```cpp
int maxAdFreeSessions(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& intervals, int k) {
    int n = intervals.size();
    std::sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
        return a[1] < b[1];
    });
    int maxSessions = 0;
    int endTime = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] >= endTime && intervals[i][1] - intervals[i][0] >= k) {
            maxSessions++;
            endTime = intervals[i][1];
        }
    }
    return maxSessions;
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are selecting the sessions with the maximum ad-free time and we are not considering any session that overlaps with the previously selected sessions.
