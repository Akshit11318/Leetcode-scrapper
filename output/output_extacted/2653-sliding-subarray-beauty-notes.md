## Sliding Subarray Beauty
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-subarray-beauty/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum `beauty` of any `k`-sized subarray. The `beauty` of a subarray is defined as the number of unique numbers in that subarray.
- Expected output format: A single integer representing the maximum beauty.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The input array will have at least `k` elements.
  - `k` will be between `1` and the length of the input array, inclusive.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For the input `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `3` because the subarray `[1,2,3]` has `3` unique numbers.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To solve this problem, we can start by checking every possible subarray of size `k` in the given array `nums`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over the array `nums` with a sliding window of size `k`.
  2. For each subarray, calculate its beauty by counting the number of unique elements.
  3. Keep track of the maximum beauty encountered so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward and intuitive way to ensure we don't miss any possible subarrays.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int beautySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int maxBeauty = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
            unordered_set<int> unique;
            for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
                unique.insert(nums[j]);
            }
            maxBeauty = max(maxBeauty, (int)unique.size());
        }
        
        return maxBeauty;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array `nums`. This is because we have a nested loop structure: the outer loop runs `n - k + 1` times, and the inner loop runs `k` times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, due to the use of an `unordered_set` to store unique elements within the current window. In the worst case, all elements in the window could be unique.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we're checking every possible subarray, and for each, we're counting unique elements. The space complexity is relatively low because we only need to store unique elements in the current window.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of recalculating the beauty of each subarray from scratch, we can use a sliding window approach more efficiently. We can maintain a frequency map of elements within the current window and update it as we slide the window.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a frequency map and a variable to track the maximum beauty.
  2. Slide the window over the array, updating the frequency map and the maximum beauty as we go.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to calculate the beauty of each subarray, leveraging the fact that the window slides by one element at a time.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int beautySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int maxBeauty = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            freq[nums[i]]++;
        }
        
        maxBeauty = max(maxBeauty, (int)freq.size());
        
        for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            freq[nums[i - k]]--;
            if (freq[nums[i - k]] == 0) {
                freq.erase(nums[i - k]);
            }
            freq[nums[i]]++;
            maxBeauty = max(maxBeauty, (int)freq.size());
        }
        
        return maxBeauty;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array `nums`. This is because we're making a single pass through the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, due to the use of an `unordered_map` to store the frequency of elements within the current window.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we're only visiting each element once and using a constant amount of extra space per element in the window.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sliding window technique, use of frequency maps to track unique elements.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The importance of looking for ways to avoid redundant calculations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using data structures like `unordered_set` or `unordered_map` to efficiently track unique elements or frequencies.
- Similar problems to practice: Other sliding window problems, such as finding the maximum sum of a subarray of a certain size.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to update the frequency map correctly as the window slides.
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring the window doesn't go out of bounds, handling cases where `k` is equal to the length of the array.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient data structures or algorithms for tracking unique elements or frequencies.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with various inputs, including edge cases and large arrays.
