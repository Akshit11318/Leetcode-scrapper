## The Employee That Worked on the Longest Task

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/the-employee-that-worked-on-the-longest-task/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a table `tasks` with columns `task_id`, `employee_id`, `start_day`, and `end_day`, find the employee that worked on the longest task.
- Expected output format: Return the `employee_id` of the employee that worked on the longest task.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The longest task is the one with the largest difference between `end_day` and `start_day`.
  - If there are multiple employees that worked on the longest task, return the one with the smallest `employee_id`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If the input is `tasks = [[1, 1, 1, 3], [2, 1, 2, 4], [3, 2, 3, 5]]`, the output should be `2`, because the longest task is the one with `task_id = 3`, which was worked on by `employee_id = 2`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through each task, calculate the duration of the task, and keep track of the employee that worked on the longest task.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize variables to store the longest task duration and the corresponding employee ID.
  2. Iterate through each task in the `tasks` table.
  3. For each task, calculate the duration by subtracting `start_day` from `end_day`.
  4. If the current task duration is longer than the longest task duration found so far, update the longest task duration and the corresponding employee ID.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
int longestTask(vector<vector<int>>& tasks) {
    int longestDuration = 0;
    int employeeId = -1;
    for (auto& task : tasks) {
        int duration = task[3] - task[2];
        if (duration > longestDuration) {
            longestDuration = duration;
            employeeId = task[1];
        } else if (duration == longestDuration) {
            employeeId = min(employeeId, task[1]);
        }
    }
    return employeeId;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of tasks, because we iterate through each task once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store the longest task duration and the corresponding employee ID.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a single pass through the tasks, and the space complexity is constant because we use a fixed amount of space to store the necessary information.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach, because we must iterate through each task at least once to find the longest task duration.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize variables to store the longest task duration and the corresponding employee ID.
  2. Iterate through each task in the `tasks` table.
  3. For each task, calculate the duration by subtracting `start_day` from `end_day`.
  4. If the current task duration is longer than the longest task duration found so far, update the longest task duration and the corresponding employee ID.
- Proof of optimality: The optimal solution has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity because we must iterate through each task at least once.

```cpp
int longestTask(vector<vector<int>>& tasks) {
    int longestDuration = 0;
    int employeeId = -1;
    for (auto& task : tasks) {
        int duration = task[3] - task[2];
        if (duration > longestDuration) {
            longestDuration = duration;
            employeeId = task[1];
        } else if (duration == longestDuration) {
            employeeId = min(employeeId, task[1]);
        }
    }
    return employeeId;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, comparison, and update of variables.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Finding the maximum or minimum value in a dataset.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the maximum or minimum value in a dataset, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in an array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing variables correctly, not updating variables correctly, or not considering edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: Tasks with the same duration, tasks with negative durations, or tasks with missing or invalid data.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using the most efficient data structures or algorithms, or not optimizing the solution for large datasets.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different datasets, including edge cases and large datasets, to ensure that it works correctly and efficiently.
