## Time Taken to Cross the Door
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/time-taken-to-cross-the-door/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a `width` of the door, an array `people` where each element is the time it takes for a person to cross the door, and an integer `threshold`, return the minimum time taken for all people to cross the door, with the constraint that no more than `threshold` people can be in the door at the same time.
- Expected output format: The minimum time taken for all people to cross the door.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - All people must cross the door.
    - The `threshold` constraint must be respected.
    - Example test cases: 
        - `width = 2`, `people = [1, 2, 3]`, `threshold = 1`
        - `width = 2`, `people = [1, 2, 3]`, `threshold = 2`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Sort the people by the time it takes them to cross the door and then assign them to groups based on the `threshold`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Sort the `people` array in ascending order.
    2. Initialize a variable `time` to store the total time taken.
    3. Iterate over the sorted `people` array and assign each person to a group.
    4. For each group, calculate the time taken for all people in the group to cross the door.
    5. Update the `time` variable with the maximum time taken by any group.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that considers the constraint and tries to minimize the time taken.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minTimeTakenToCrossTheDoor(int width, std::vector<int>& people, int threshold) {
    std::sort(people.begin(), people.end());
    int time = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < people.size(); i += threshold) {
        int groupTime = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < std::min(i + threshold, (int)people.size()); j++) {
            groupTime = std::max(groupTime, people[j]);
        }
        time += groupTime;
    }
    return time;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + n \cdot t)$ where $n$ is the number of people and $t$ is the threshold. The sorting operation takes $O(n \log n)$ time, and the iteration over the people array takes $O(n \cdot t)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ since we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The sorting operation is the main contributor to the time complexity, and the iteration over the people array is necessary to calculate the time taken for each group.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Since the people are sorted by the time it takes them to cross the door, we can use a greedy approach to assign people to groups.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Sort the `people` array in ascending order.
    2. Initialize a variable `time` to store the total time taken.
    3. Iterate over the sorted `people` array and assign each person to a group.
    4. For each group, calculate the time taken for all people in the group to cross the door.
    5. Update the `time` variable with the maximum time taken by any group.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the time taken for each group by assigning the people with the shortest crossing times to the same group.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minTimeTakenToCrossTheDoor(int width, std::vector<int>& people, int threshold) {
    std::sort(people.begin(), people.end());
    int time = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < people.size(); i += threshold) {
        int groupTime = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < std::min(i + threshold, (int)people.size()); j++) {
            groupTime = std::max(groupTime, people[j]);
        }
        time += groupTime;
    }
    return time;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, greedy approach, and iteration over an array.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Assigning people to groups based on a constraint and calculating the time taken for each group.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a greedy approach to minimize the time taken for each group.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve assigning items to groups based on a constraint and calculating the time taken for each group.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not sorting the people array, not updating the time variable correctly, and not handling edge cases correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty people array, threshold of 0 or 1, and people array with a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a greedy approach and not minimizing the time taken for each group.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different input sizes, different thresholds, and different people arrays.
