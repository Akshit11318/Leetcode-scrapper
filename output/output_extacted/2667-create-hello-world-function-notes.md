## Create Hello World Function

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/create-hello-world-function/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: No input is required.
- Expected output format: The function should print or return the string "Hello, World!".
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: None.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - Example 1: Calling the function should return or print "Hello, World!".

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to simply print or return the required string.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Define a function named `helloWorld`.
    2. Inside the function, print or return the string "Hello, World!".
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement with minimal complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

string helloWorld() {
    // This function simply returns "Hello, World!"
    return "Hello, World!";
}

int main() {
    // Call the function and print the result
    cout << helloWorld() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the function performs a constant number of operations regardless of the input (which in this case is none).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the function uses a constant amount of space to store the return string.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because the function does not depend on any input size; it always performs the same operation.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is essentially the same as the brute force approach because the problem does not require any complex operations or optimizations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: Define a function that returns or prints the required string.
- Proof of optimality: This is the most straightforward and efficient way to solve the problem given its simplicity.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The problem requires no input processing, data structures, or algorithms that could be optimized.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void helloWorld() {
    // This function simply prints "Hello, World!"
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Call the function
    helloWorld();
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the function performs a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the function uses a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The simplicity of the problem means that any solution will have a similar complexity, making this approach optimal due to its straightforwardness and minimal overhead.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: None, as this problem is about understanding the basic structure of a function.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Recognizing when a problem can be solved with a simple, direct approach.
- Optimization techniques learned: Not applicable, as the problem does not require optimization.
- Similar problems to practice: Other basic function implementation problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to include the necessary `using namespace std;` directive or not properly handling output with `cout`.
- Edge cases to watch for: None, given the simplicity of the problem.
- Performance pitfalls: Overcomplicating the solution with unnecessary operations or data structures.
- Testing considerations: Ensure that the function correctly prints or returns "Hello, World!" without any additional output.
