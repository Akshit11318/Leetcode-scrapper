## Super Egg Drop
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given `k` eggs and `n` floors, find the minimum number of attempts required to determine the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of attempts required.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - `1 <= k <= 100`
  - `1 <= n <= 10000`
  - The input `k` and `n` are integers.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `k = 1, n = 2` -> The minimum number of attempts required is `2`, because we can try dropping the egg from the first floor, and then from the second floor.
  - `k = 2, n = 6` -> The minimum number of attempts required is `3`, because we can try dropping the egg from the third floor, and then from the sixth floor if it breaks, or from the fourth floor if it doesn't break.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of dropping the egg from each floor.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` to store the minimum number of attempts required for `i` eggs and `j` floors.
  2. Iterate over each cell in the `dp` array, and for each cell, try dropping the egg from each floor from `1` to `j`.
  3. For each floor, calculate the minimum number of attempts required if the egg breaks and if it doesn't break.
  4. Update the `dp` array with the minimum number of attempts required for each cell.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that tries all possible combinations, but it's not efficient due to its high time complexity.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int superEggDrop(int k, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            int res = INT_MAX;
            for (int x = 1; x <= j; x++) {
                int val = 1 + max(dp[i - 1][x - 1], dp[i][j - x]);
                res = min(res, val);
            }
            dp[i][j] = res;
        }
    }
    return dp[k][n];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n^2)$, where $k$ is the number of eggs and $n$ is the number of floors. This is because we have two nested loops that iterate over each floor, and for each floor, we try dropping the egg from each floor.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n)$, where $k$ is the number of eggs and $n$ is the number of floors. This is because we need to store the minimum number of attempts required for each cell in the `dp` array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity occurs because we're trying all possible combinations of dropping the egg from each floor, which results in a lot of repeated calculations. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the minimum number of attempts required for each cell in the `dp` array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a more efficient dynamic programming approach that reduces the time complexity.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` to store the minimum number of attempts required for `i` eggs and `j` floors.
  2. Iterate over each cell in the `dp` array, and for each cell, try dropping the egg from each floor from `1` to `j`.
  3. For each floor, calculate the minimum number of attempts required if the egg breaks and if it doesn't break.
  4. Update the `dp` array with the minimum number of attempts required for each cell.
  5. To reduce the time complexity, we can use a binary search approach to find the optimal floor to drop the egg from.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(k \cdot n \log n)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int superEggDrop(int k, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        int j = 1;
        while (j <= n) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1;
            int low = 1, high = j;
            while (low < high) {
                int mid = (low + high) / 2;
                if (dp[i - 1][mid - 1] < dp[i][j - mid]) {
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    high = mid;
                }
            }
            if (dp[i - 1][low - 1] == dp[i][j - low]) {
                break;
            }
            j++;
        }
    }
    return dp[k][n];
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, binary search.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a more efficient approach to reduce the time complexity.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a binary search approach to find the optimal floor to drop the egg from.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the `0/1 Knapsack Problem` and the `Longest Common Subsequence Problem`.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` array correctly, not updating the `dp` array correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where `k` is `1` or `n` is `1`.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a more efficient approach, such as the binary search approach, to reduce the time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the code with different inputs, such as different values of `k` and `n`, to ensure that it's working correctly.
