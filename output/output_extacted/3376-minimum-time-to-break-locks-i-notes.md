## Minimum Time to Break Locks I
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-break-locks-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `locks`, where each element represents the number of minutes required to break a lock.
- Constraints: The length of the `locks` array is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- Expected output format: The minimum time required to break all locks.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The minimum time is the minimum of the maximum time required to break a lock in each possible subset of locks.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `locks = [1, 2, 3]`
    - Output: `3`
    - Explanation: Breaking the third lock requires the maximum time in the subset `[3]`.
  - Input: `locks = [1, 2, 1]`
    - Output: `3`
    - Explanation: Breaking the second lock requires the maximum time in the subset `[2]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible subsets of locks and find the minimum time required to break all locks in each subset.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of the `locks` array.
  2. For each subset, find the maximum time required to break a lock in that subset.
  3. Find the minimum of these maximum times across all subsets.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that considers all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minimumTimeToBreakLocks(vector<int>& locks) {
    int n = locks.size();
    int minTime = INT_MAX;

    // Generate all possible subsets
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        int maxTime = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                maxTime = max(maxTime, locks[i]);
            }
        }
        minTime = min(minTime, maxTime);
    }

    return minTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of locks. This is because we generate all possible subsets of locks (which takes $O(2^n)$ time) and for each subset, we find the maximum time required to break a lock (which takes $O(n)$ time).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum time and the current subset.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we consider all possible subsets of locks, which grows exponentially with the number of locks. The space complexity is low because we don't use any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The minimum time required to break all locks is the minimum time required to break any lock.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Find the minimum time required to break any lock.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers the minimum time required to break any lock, which is the minimum time required to break all locks.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem because we must at least read the input.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minimumTimeToBreakLocks(vector<int>& locks) {
    return *min_element(locks.begin(), locks.end());
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of locks. This is because we find the minimum time required to break any lock using the `min_element` function, which takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum time.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.
