## Minimum Processing Time

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-processing-time/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves finding the minimum processing time for a set of tasks with given processing times and a target completion time.
- Expected output format: The output is the minimum processing time required to complete all tasks within the target time.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The problem requires considering the total processing time of all tasks and finding the minimum processing time per task to meet the target completion time.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Given tasks = [3, 3, 1], target = 5, the output should be 2 because we can process the first two tasks in 2 units of time and the last task in 1 unit of time, achieving a total time of 3 + 2 + 1 = 6, which is greater than the target. However, this is the minimum time required to process all tasks.
  - Example 2: Given tasks = [1, 2, 3], target = 6, the output should be 1 because we can process all tasks in their given times, and the total time is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which meets the target.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible processing times for each task and checking if the total time meets the target.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize the minimum processing time to a large value.
  2. Iterate over all possible processing times for each task.
  3. For each possible processing time, calculate the total time required to complete all tasks.
  4. Check if the total time meets the target. If it does, update the minimum processing time.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it has high time complexity due to the iteration over all possible processing times.

```cpp
int minimumProcessingTime(vector<int>& tasks, int target) {
    int n = tasks.size();
    int minTime = INT_MAX;
    for (int time = 1; time <= target; time++) {
        int totalTime = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalTime += max(tasks[i], time);
        }
        if (totalTime <= target) {
            minTime = min(minTime, time);
        }
    }
    return minTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot target)$, where n is the number of tasks and target is the target completion time. This is because we iterate over all possible processing times for each task.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum processing time.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high due to the iteration over all possible processing times, and the space complexity is low because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using binary search to find the minimum processing time. We can calculate the total time required to complete all tasks for a given processing time and check if it meets the target.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the minimum and maximum processing times.
  2. Perform binary search to find the minimum processing time.
  3. For each mid processing time, calculate the total time required to complete all tasks.
  4. Check if the total time meets the target. If it does, update the maximum processing time. Otherwise, update the minimum processing time.
- Proof of optimality: The binary search approach is optimal because it reduces the search space by half at each step, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity.

```cpp
int minimumProcessingTime(vector<int>& tasks, int target) {
    int n = tasks.size();
    int low = 1, high = target;
    int ans = target;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        int totalTime = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalTime += max(tasks[i], mid);
        }
        if (totalTime <= target) {
            ans = mid;
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
