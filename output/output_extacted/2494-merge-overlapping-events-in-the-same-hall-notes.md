## Merge Overlapping Events in the Same Hall

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-overlapping-events-in-the-same-hall/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A list of events where each event is an array `[start, end]`.
- Constraints: `1 <= events.length <= 100`, `0 <= start < end <= 1000`.
- Expected output format: A list of merged events where overlapping events are combined into a single event with the earliest start and latest end time.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Events may overlap.
  - Events may not overlap.
  - Input list may be empty.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `[[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7]]` should return `[[1, 4], [5, 7]]`.
  - `[[1, 3], [4, 5]]` should return `[[1, 3], [4, 5]]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Sort the events by start time and then iterate through them to check for overlaps.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Sort the events by start time.
  2. Initialize the merged list with the first event.
  3. Iterate through the rest of the events.
  4. For each event, check if it overlaps with the last event in the merged list.
  5. If they overlap, merge them by updating the end time of the last event in the merged list.
  6. If they do not overlap, add the current event to the merged list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward and easy to understand.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> mergeEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
    if (events.empty()) return {};

    // Sort events by start time
    sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        return a[0] < b[0];
    });

    vector<vector<int>> merged;
    merged.push_back(events[0]);

    for (int i = 1; i < events.size(); i++) {
        // Check if the current event overlaps with the last event in merged
        if (events[i][0] <= merged.back()[1]) {
            // Merge the events
            merged.back()[1] = max(merged.back()[1], events[i][1]);
        } else {
            // Add the current event to merged
            merged.push_back(events[i]);
        }
    }

    return merged;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to sorting, where $n$ is the number of events.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the merged events.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** Sorting is necessary to ensure that we can efficiently check for overlaps between events. The space complexity is due to storing the merged events.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same insight as the brute force approach, but recognizing that sorting is the most efficient way to handle the events and that the rest of the algorithm is already optimal.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach is the same as the brute force approach because it already has a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, which is optimal for this problem since we must sort the events to efficiently check for overlaps.
- Proof of optimality: Any algorithm that solves this problem must at least sort the events, which takes $O(n \log n)$ time. Therefore, the given approach is optimal.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because the time complexity is already $O(n \log n)$, which is the best we can do for this problem.

```cpp
// The code remains the same as the brute force approach
vector<vector<int>> mergeEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
    if (events.empty()) return {};

    // Sort events by start time
    sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        return a[0] < b[0];
    });

    vector<vector<int>> merged;
    merged.push_back(events[0]);

    for (int i = 1; i < events.size(); i++) {
        // Check if the current event overlaps with the last event in merged
        if (events[i][0] <= merged.back()[1]) {
            // Merge the events
            merged.back()[1] = max(merged.back()[1], events[i][1]);
        } else {
            // Add the current event to merged
            merged.push_back(events[i]);
        }
    }

    return merged;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to sorting.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the merged events.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most efficient algorithm possible because sorting is necessary and the rest of the operations are already optimized.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting and iterating through events to check for overlaps.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Recognizing the need to sort data to efficiently solve a problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Understanding that sometimes the first approach is already optimal, and further optimization is not possible.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving sorting and merging data, such as merging intervals or finding overlapping intervals.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty input list.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input list, events that do not overlap, and events that overlap.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient sorting algorithm or not recognizing that sorting is necessary.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it works correctly.
