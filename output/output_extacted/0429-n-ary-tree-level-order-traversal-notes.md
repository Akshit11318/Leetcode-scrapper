## N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem provides an `n-ary` tree as input, where each node is represented by a unique integer value and has a list of child nodes. The constraints include that the tree will have at least one node and at most $10^4$ nodes, with each node having at most $10^4$ children.
- Expected output format: The task is to return a list of lists, where each sublist contains the node values of the corresponding level in the tree, ordered from left to right.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The solution must handle trees of varying depths and widths, ensuring that all nodes are visited and their values are correctly placed in the output list.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given a tree with the following structure:
```markdown
    1
   /|\
  3 2 4
 / \
5   6
```
The output should be `[[1],[3,2,4],[5,6]]`, representing the node values at each level of the tree.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves recursively traversing the tree, keeping track of the current level, and appending node values to the corresponding sublist in the result.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the node values at each level.
  2. Define a recursive function `traverse(node, level)` that takes a node and its level as arguments.
  3. Within the recursive function, check if the current level is within the bounds of the `result` list. If not, append a new sublist to `result`.
  4. Append the current node's value to the sublist corresponding to its level.
  5. Recursively call `traverse` for each child node, incrementing the level by 1.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is intuitive because it directly follows the tree's structure and leverages recursion to handle the tree's depth.

```cpp
// Brute Force Approach
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(Node* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if (!root) return result;
        
        traverse(root, 0, result);
        
        return result;
    }
    
    void traverse(Node* node, int level, vector<vector<int>>& result) {
        if (level >= result.size()) {
            result.push_back({});
        }
        result[level].push_back(node->val);
        
        for (Node* child : node->children) {
            traverse(child, level + 1, result);
        }
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the tree, since we visit each node once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$, for storing the result and the recursive call stack in the worst case (a skewed tree).
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we visit each node once, and the space complexity is also linear due to the storage needed for the result and the recursive call stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of using recursion, which can lead to high memory usage due to the call stack, we can use a queue-based approach to perform a level-order traversal. This approach is more efficient in terms of memory usage for very deep trees.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the node values at each level.
  2. Initialize a queue with the root node.
  3. While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
    - Initialize an empty list `level_values` to store the node values at the current level.
    - Dequeue all nodes at the current level, appending their values to `level_values` and enqueuing their children.
    - Append `level_values` to `result`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it visits each node exactly once and uses a minimal amount of extra memory to store the nodes at each level.

```cpp
// Optimal Approach
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(Node* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if (!root) return result;
        
        queue<Node*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            vector<int> level_values;
            int level_size = q.size();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < level_size; i++) {
                Node* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                level_values.push_back(node->val);
                
                for (Node* child : node->children) {
                    q.push(child);
                }
            }
            result.push_back(level_values);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the tree, since we visit each node once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$, for storing the result and the queue in the worst case (a tree with all nodes at the last level).
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most efficient approach in terms of time complexity. The space complexity is also optimal for this problem, as we need to store the result and the nodes at each level.

- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to handle the case where a node has no children, or incorrectly appending node values to the result.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty trees, trees with a single node, and very deep trees.
- Performance pitfalls: Using recursion for very deep trees, which can lead to stack overflow errors.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with different tree structures and sizes to ensure correctness and efficiency.
