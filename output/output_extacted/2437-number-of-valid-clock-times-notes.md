## Number of Valid Clock Times
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-clock-times/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a string `time` in the format "HH:MM", where `HH` and `MM` are two-digit integers, determine if the time is valid.
- A valid time is between 00:00 and 23:59.
- Return the number of valid times in the range from `0` to `time`, inclusive.

**Input Format and Constraints:**
- `time` is a string in the format "HH:MM".
- `0 <= HH <= 23` and `0 <= MM <= 59`.

**Expected Output Format:**
- An integer representing the number of valid times in the range from `0` to `time`, inclusive.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases to Consider:**
- Handle cases where `HH` or `MM` is greater than 23 or 59, respectively.
- Consider the inclusive range from `0` to `time`.

**Example Test Cases with Explanations:**
- Input: `time = "13:30"`; Output: `660`
- Input: `time = "02:30"`; Output: `150`
- Input: `time = "12:00"`; Output: `720`

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves iterating over all possible times from `00:00` to `23:59` and checking if each time is less than or equal to the given `time`.
- We can use two nested loops to generate all possible times and compare them with the given `time`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTime(string time) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int h = 0; h < 24; h++) {
            for (int m = 0; m < 60; m++) {
                string t = (h < 10 ? "0" : "") + to_string(h) + ":" + (m < 10 ? "0" : "") + to_string(m);
                if (t <= time) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(24 \cdot 60)$ = $O(1440)$, because we iterate over all possible times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store the count and the temporary time string.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the nested loops that generate all possible times, and the space complexity is due to the constant amount of space used to store the count and the temporary time string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is to realize that we can calculate the number of valid times by considering the possible values of hours and minutes separately.
- We can use the given `time` to determine the range of valid hours and minutes.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTime(string time) {
        int h = stoi(time.substr(0, 2));
        int m = stoi(time.substr(3, 2));
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 24; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 60; j++) {
                if (i < h || (i == h && j <= m)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

However, a more optimal solution exists by realizing that we don't need to iterate over all possible times. We can calculate the number of valid times directly based on the given `time`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTime(string time) {
        int h = stoi(time.substr(0, 2));
        int m = stoi(time.substr(3, 2));
        return (h * 60) + m + 1;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we perform a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store the count and the given `time`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we calculate the number of valid times directly without iterating over all possible times.
