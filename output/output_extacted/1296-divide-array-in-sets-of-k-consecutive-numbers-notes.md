## Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= k <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.
- Expected output: Return `true` if the array can be divided into sets of `k` consecutive numbers, `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array can be divided into sets of `k` consecutive numbers if every number in the array can be assigned to a set such that each set contains `k` consecutive numbers.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6], k = 4`: The array can be divided into sets of `4` consecutive numbers: `[1,2,3,4]` and `[3,4,5,6]`.
  - `nums = [3,3,2,2,1,1], k = 3`: The array can be divided into sets of `3` consecutive numbers: `[1,2,3]` and `[1,2,3]`.
  - `nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3`: The array cannot be divided into sets of `3` consecutive numbers.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible sets of `k` consecutive numbers and check if the array can be divided into these sets.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible sets of `k` consecutive numbers.
  2. Iterate over the array and try to assign each number to a set.
  3. If a number cannot be assigned to a set, return `false`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries to divide the array into sets of `k` consecutive numbers by generating all possible sets and assigning numbers to these sets.

```cpp
bool isPossibleDivide(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Generate all possible sets of k consecutive numbers
    vector<vector<int>> sets;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 100000 - k + 1; i++) {
        vector<int> set;
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            set.push_back(i + j);
        }
        sets.push_back(set);
    }

    // Try to assign each number to a set
    unordered_map<int, int> count;
    for (int num : nums) {
        count[num]++;
    }

    for (int num : nums) {
        if (count[num] == 0) continue;
        bool assigned = false;
        for (vector<int>& set : sets) {
            bool valid = true;
            for (int x : set) {
                if (count[x - num + set[0]] == 0) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (valid) {
                for (int x : set) {
                    count[x - num + set[0]]--;
                }
                assigned = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!assigned) return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the array, $k$ is the size of each set, and $m$ is the number of possible sets.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + k \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the array, $k$ is the size of each set, and $m$ is the number of possible sets.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates all possible sets of `k` consecutive numbers and tries to assign each number to a set, resulting in a high time and space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a greedy approach to assign numbers to sets of `k` consecutive numbers.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Count the frequency of each number in the array.
  2. Iterate over the numbers in ascending order and try to assign each number to a set of `k` consecutive numbers.
  3. If a number cannot be assigned to a set, return `false`.
- Proof of optimality: The greedy approach ensures that each number is assigned to a set of `k` consecutive numbers as soon as possible, resulting in an optimal solution.

```cpp
bool isPossibleDivide(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    unordered_map<int, int> count;
    for (int num : nums) {
        count[num]++;
    }

    vector<int> sortedNums;
    for (auto& pair : count) {
        sortedNums.push_back(pair.first);
    }
    sort(sortedNums.begin(), sortedNums.end());

    for (int num : sortedNums) {
        if (count[num] > 0) {
            int need = count[num];
            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                if (count[num + i] < need) return false;
                count[num + i] -= need;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the array and $k` is the size of each set.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n` is the length of the array.
> - **Optimality proof:** The greedy approach ensures that each number is assigned to a set of `k` consecutive numbers as soon as possible, resulting in an optimal solution with a low time and space complexity.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy approach, frequency counting, and sorting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a greedy approach to assign numbers to sets of `k` consecutive numbers.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a greedy approach to reduce the time and space complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve assigning numbers to sets or groups, such as the "Partition Equal Subset Sum" problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases, such as an empty array or a `k` value of 0.
- Edge cases to watch for: An array with duplicate numbers, or a `k` value that is larger than the length of the array.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that results in a high time and space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input sizes and edge cases to ensure correctness and performance.
