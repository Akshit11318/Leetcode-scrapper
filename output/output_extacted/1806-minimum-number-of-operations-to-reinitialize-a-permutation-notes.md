## Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-reinitialize-a-permutation/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `n` and `arr`, where `arr` is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 100`, `arr.length == n`, `0 <= arr[i] < n`, and all the numbers in the array are distinct.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations required to reinitialize the permutation.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The permutation is reinitialized when `arr[i] == i` for all `i`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `n = 2, arr = [1,0]`, Output: `1`
  - Input: `n = 4, arr = [0,1,2,3]`, Output: `0`

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can simulate the process of reinitializing the permutation by repeatedly applying the operation until the permutation is reinitialized.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `operations` to 0.
  2. Create a copy of the input array `arr`.
  3. While the permutation is not reinitialized, apply the operation and increment `operations`.
  4. Return `operations`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward simulation of the problem.

```cpp
int reinitializePermutation(int n, vector<int>& arr) {
    vector<int> initial = arr;
    vector<int> perm(n);
    int operations = 0;
    while (true) {
        bool reinitialized = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] != i) {
                reinitialized = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (reinitialized) break;
        operations++;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) perm[i] = arr[i / 2];
            else perm[i] = arr[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2];
        }
        arr = perm;
    }
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times k)$, where $k$ is the number of operations required to reinitialize the permutation. This is because in the worst case, we need to apply the operation $k$ times, and each operation takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we need to create a copy of the input array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we need to repeatedly apply the operation until the permutation is reinitialized. The space complexity occurs because we need to create a copy of the input array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can observe that the operation is equivalent to a cycle in the permutation.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Find the cycle length of each element in the permutation.
  2. The minimum number of operations required to reinitialize the permutation is the least common multiple (LCM) of the cycle lengths.
- Proof of optimality: The LCM of the cycle lengths is the minimum number of operations required to reinitialize the permutation because it is the smallest number of operations that will reinitialize all elements in the permutation.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The LCM of the cycle lengths is the minimum number of operations required to reinitialize the permutation because it is the smallest number of operations that will reinitialize all elements in the permutation.

```cpp
int reinitializePermutation(int n, vector<int>& arr) {
    vector<int> visited(n, 0);
    int operations = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (visited[i]) continue;
        int length = 0;
        int j = i;
        while (!visited[j]) {
            visited[j] = 1;
            j = arr[j];
            length++;
        }
        if (length > 0) {
            if (operations == 0) operations = length;
            else operations = lcm(operations, length);
        }
    }
    return operations;
}

int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return a * b / gcd(a, b);
}

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we need to visit each element in the permutation once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we need to create a visited array to keep track of the elements we have visited.
> - **Optimality proof:** The LCM of the cycle lengths is the minimum number of operations required to reinitialize the permutation because it is the smallest number of operations that will reinitialize all elements in the permutation.
