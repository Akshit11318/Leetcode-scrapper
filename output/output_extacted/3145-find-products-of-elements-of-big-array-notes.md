## Find Products of Elements of Big Array

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-products-of-elements-of-big-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a 2D array `nums` containing integers, where each inner array represents a group of numbers.
- Expected output format: Find the product of all elements in each group.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where the input array is empty or contains empty groups.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `nums = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[6]]`, Output: `[6,20,6]`
  - Example 2: Input: `nums = [[]]`, Output: `[1]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each group in the input array, calculate the product of all its elements.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty array `products` to store the product of each group.
  2. Iterate through each group in the input array `nums`.
  3. For each group, initialize a variable `product` to 1.
  4. Iterate through each element in the group and multiply `product` by the current element.
  5. After processing all elements in the group, append `product` to the `products` array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by iterating through each group and calculating the product of its elements.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> findProducts(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
    vector<int> products;
    for (const auto& group : nums) {
        int product = 1;
        for (const auto& num : group) {
            product *= num;
        }
        products.push_back(product);
    }
    return products;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of groups and $m$ is the maximum size of a group. This is because we iterate through each element in each group.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of groups. This is because we store the product of each group in the `products` array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear with respect to the total number of elements because we visit each element once. The space complexity is linear with respect to the number of groups because we store one product per group.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already quite efficient for this problem, with a time complexity of $O(n \cdot m)$. However, we can slightly optimize the code by handling the case where a group is empty more explicitly and efficiently, returning 1 as the product of an empty group.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Check if a group is empty and if so, directly append 1 to the `products` array.
  2. Otherwise, proceed with the multiplication as in the brute force approach.
- Proof of optimality: Since we must visit each element at least once to calculate its product, the time complexity of $O(n \cdot m)$ is optimal for this problem.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> findProducts(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
    vector<int> products;
    for (const auto& group : nums) {
        if (group.empty()) {
            products.push_back(1); // Product of an empty group is 1
        } else {
            int product = 1;
            for (const auto& num : group) {
                product *= num;
            }
            products.push_back(product);
        }
    }
    return products;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of groups and $m$ is the maximum size of a group.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of groups.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity remains the same as the brute force approach because we still visit each element once. The space complexity also remains the same. The slight optimization for empty groups does not change the overall complexity but improves the code's handling of edge cases.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, multiplication, and handling of edge cases.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct calculation and optimization of edge cases.
- Optimization techniques learned: Handling special cases (like empty groups) explicitly.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving array or matrix operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to handle edge cases, like empty groups or the input array itself being empty.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty groups, groups with a single element, and the input array being empty.
- Performance pitfalls: Unnecessary iterations or not handling edge cases efficiently.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with a variety of inputs, including edge cases like empty groups or the input array being empty.
