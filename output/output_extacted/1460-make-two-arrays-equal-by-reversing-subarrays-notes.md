## Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/make-two-arrays-equal-by-reversing-subarrays/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given two integer arrays `target` and `arr`, we need to determine if we can make `arr` equal to `target` by reversing subarrays of `arr`. 
- We can reverse any subarray of `arr` as many times as we want.
- The input arrays will have the same length.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if it is possible to make `arr` equal to `target`, otherwise return `false`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The input arrays are of the same length.
  - The input arrays contain only integers.
  - We can reverse any subarray of `arr` as many times as we want.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - If `target = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `arr = [2, 4, 1, 3]`, we can make `arr` equal to `target` by reversing the subarray `[2, 4]` to get `[4, 2]`, then reversing the subarray `[4, 2, 1]` to get `[1, 2, 4]`, and finally reversing the subarray `[2, 4]` to get `[4, 2]`, but this is not the correct approach as we need to check if the two arrays have the same elements, not the order.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to check all possible reversals of subarrays of `arr` to see if we can make `arr` equal to `target`.
- However, this approach is not efficient because there are many possible reversals of subarrays, and checking all of them would result in a time complexity of $O(n!)$, where $n$ is the length of `arr`.
- A better approach would be to sort both arrays and compare them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeEqual(vector<int>& target, vector<int>& arr) {
        sort(target.begin(), target.end());
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        return target == arr;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of `target` (or `arr`), because we are sorting both arrays.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are sorting the arrays in place.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is $O(n \log n)$ because the sorting algorithm used by the `sort` function in C++ has a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$. The space complexity is $O(1)$ because we are sorting the arrays in place, so we do not need any extra space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach is to use a hash map to count the frequency of each element in both arrays.
- We can then compare the two hash maps to see if they are equal.
- If they are equal, it means that the two arrays have the same elements, and we can make `arr` equal to `target` by reversing subarrays.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeEqual(vector<int>& target, vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        for (int num : target) {
            count[num]++;
        }
        for (int num : arr) {
            count[num]--;
            if (count[num] < 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `target` (or `arr`), because we are iterating over both arrays once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we are using a hash map to store the frequency of each element.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are only iterating over the arrays once, and we are using a hash map to store the frequency of each element, which allows us to compare the two arrays in linear time.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The key algorithmic concept demonstrated in this problem is the use of sorting and hash maps to compare two arrays.
- The problem-solving pattern identified in this problem is to use a hash map to count the frequency of each element in both arrays, and then compare the two hash maps.
- The optimization technique learned in this problem is to use a hash map to store the frequency of each element, which allows us to compare the two arrays in linear time.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- A common implementation error in this problem is to use a brute force approach that checks all possible reversals of subarrays, which results in a time complexity of $O(n!)$.
- An edge case to watch for in this problem is when the input arrays are empty, in which case the function should return `true`.
- A performance pitfall to avoid in this problem is to use a sorting algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, such as bubble sort or insertion sort, which would result in a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for the entire function.
