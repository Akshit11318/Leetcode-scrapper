## Stone Game IX
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-ix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile.
- Expected output format: A boolean indicating whether Alice can win the game.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The game ends when one player cannot make a move, and the player with the most stones wins.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `stones = [0,1,0,2]`
    Output: `True`
    Explanation: Alice can remove one stone from the second pile to get a remainder of 0, then Bob must remove one stone from the fourth pile to get a remainder of 1. Now, Alice can remove one stone from the fourth pile to get a remainder of 0, and Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can try all possible moves for Alice and Bob, and use a recursive function to determine if Alice can win.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a set to store the remainders we have seen.
  2. For each pile, try removing one stone to get a remainder.
  3. If the remainder is 0, add it to the set.
  4. If the remainder is not 0, recursively call the function to see if Bob can win.
  5. If Bob cannot win, return True.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward way to try all possible moves and determine if Alice can win.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool stoneGameIX(vector<int>& stones) {
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        for (int stone : stones) {
            int remainder = stone % 3;
            if (remainder == 0) {
                seen.insert(0);
            } else {
                if (seen.find(remainder) != seen.end()) {
                    seen.insert(0);
                } else {
                    seen.insert(remainder);
                }
            }
        }
        return seen.find(0) != seen.end();
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of stones.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we are using a set to store the remainders.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** We are iterating over the stones once, and using a set to store the remainders, which takes constant space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a hashmap to store the count of each remainder.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a hashmap to store the count of each remainder.
  2. For each pile, increment the count of the remainder in the hashmap.
  3. If the count of 0 is greater than or equal to 2, return True.
  4. If the count of 1 and 2 is greater than or equal to 1, return True.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because we are only iterating over the stones once, and using a hashmap to store the count of each remainder, which takes constant space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool stoneGameIX(vector<int>& stones) {
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        for (int stone : stones) {
            int remainder = stone % 3;
            count[remainder]++;
        }
        return (count[0] >= 2) || (count[1] >= 1 && count[2] >= 1);
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Using a hashmap to store the count of each remainder.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a hashmap to store the count of each remainder, and checking if the count of 0 is greater than or equal to 2, or if the count of 1 and 2 is greater than or equal to 1.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a hashmap to store the count of each remainder, and checking if the count of 0 is greater than or equal to 2, or if the count of 1 and 2 is greater than or equal to 1.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve using a hashmap to store the count of each remainder, and checking if the count of 0 is greater than or equal to 2, or if the count of 1 and 2 is greater than or equal to 1.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking if the count of 0 is greater than or equal to 2, or if the count of 1 and 2 is greater than or equal to 1.
- Edge cases to watch for: If the input is empty, or if the input contains only one element.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a hashmap to store the count of each remainder, which can lead to a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it returns the correct result.
