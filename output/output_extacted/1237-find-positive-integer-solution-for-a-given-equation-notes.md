## Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-positive-integer-solution-for-a-given-equation/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a `CustomFunction` interface, find all positive integer solutions for `f(x, y)` equal to `z`. The given function `f` takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns an integer.
- Expected output format: Return a list of all positive integer pairs `(x, y)` such that `f(x, y)` equals `z`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: All input values are positive integers, and `f(x, y)` can be any integer.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - For `f(x, y) = x + y`, `z = 5`, possible solutions are `(1, 4)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 2)`, and `(4, 1)`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of positive integers for `x` and `y`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Iterate through all possible values of `x` and `y`.
    2. For each pair `(x, y)`, compute `f(x, y)`.
    3. If `f(x, y)` equals `z`, add the pair to the result list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward and guarantees finding all solutions, but it may be inefficient for large values of `x` and `y`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findSolution(CustomFunction& customfunction, int z) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        for (int x = 1; x <= 1000; x++) {  // Assuming x will not exceed 1000
            for (int y = 1; y <= 1000; y++) {
                if (customfunction.f(x, y) == z) {
                    result.push_back({x, y});
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the upper limit of `x` and `y` (in this case, 1000). This is because we are iterating through all possible pairs of `x` and `y`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ in the worst case, if all pairs of `x` and `y` result in `f(x, y)` equal to `z`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking every possible pair of `x` and `y`, leading to quadratic time and space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of trying all possible values of `x` and `y`, we can use a more targeted approach by iterating through possible values of `x` and then finding the corresponding `y` values.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. For each possible value of `x`, find the range of `y` values that could potentially satisfy `f(x, y) == z`.
    2. Use a binary search or similar efficient method to find the exact `y` values within this range that satisfy the equation.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of times we need to evaluate `f(x, y)` by focusing on promising `x` and `y` values.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findSolution(CustomFunction& customfunction, int z) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        for (int x = 1; x <= 1000; x++) {
            int left = 1, right = 1000;
            while (left <= right) {
                int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                int val = customfunction.f(x, mid);
                if (val == z) {
                    result.push_back({x, mid});
                    break;  // Assuming f(x, y) is monotonic
                } else if (val < z) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the upper limit of `x` and `y`. This is because for each `x`, we perform a binary search over the range of `y`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ in the worst case, if all `x` values have a corresponding `y` that satisfies the equation.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it reduces the number of evaluations of `f(x, y)` to a logarithmic factor for each `x`, significantly improving over the brute force approach for large ranges of `x` and `y`.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Binary search, targeted iteration.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Reducing the search space, using efficient search algorithms.
- Optimization techniques learned: Focusing on promising areas of the search space, minimizing function evaluations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving finding solutions within a large search space, such as `Search a 2D Matrix II`.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect loop bounds, failure to handle edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `x` or `y` is very large, or when `f(x, y)` has a complex behavior.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient search algorithms or evaluating `f(x, y)` unnecessarily.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with a variety of `CustomFunction` implementations and edge cases.
