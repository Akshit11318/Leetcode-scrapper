## Append K Integers with Minimal Sum

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/append-k-integers-with-minimal-sum/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an integer `num` and an integer `k`, return the **smallest possible integer** that can be obtained by **appending** `k` **integers** to `num`.
- Input: `num` and `k` are integers.
- Expected output: The smallest possible integer after appending `k` integers.
- Key requirements: The appended integers should be chosen to minimize the resulting integer.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `num = 99`, `k = 2`
    - Output: `9911`
  - Input: `num = 10`, `k = 1`
    - Output: `101`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try appending all possible integers from 0 to 9 to the end of `num`, and then choose the smallest resulting integer.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible integers from 0 to 9.
  2. Append each integer to `num` to form a new integer.
  3. Compare the resulting integers and choose the smallest one.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and naive approach to solve the problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long appendKIntegers(long long num, int k) {
        // Generate all possible integers from 0 to 9
        vector<long long> possibleIntegers;
        for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
            possibleIntegers.push_back(i);
        }
        
        // Initialize the smallest integer
        long long smallestInteger = LLONG_MAX;
        
        // Try appending each integer to num
        for (int i = 0; i < possibleIntegers.size(); i++) {
            long long newInteger = num * 10 + possibleIntegers[i];
            // If the new integer is smaller than the current smallest integer, update it
            if (newInteger < smallestInteger) {
                smallestInteger = newInteger;
            }
        }
        
        // Append k-1 more integers to the smallest integer
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            smallestInteger *= 10;
        }
        
        return smallestInteger;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are only trying a fixed number of possible integers (0 to 9).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the possible integers and the smallest integer.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is constant because we are only trying a fixed number of possible integers, and the space complexity is constant because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the necessary variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The smallest possible integer that can be obtained by appending `k` integers to `num` is obtained by appending `k` zeros to `num`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Append `k` zeros to `num` to form the smallest possible integer.
- Proof of optimality: Appending any non-zero integer to `num` would result in a larger integer than appending zeros.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Appending zeros is the optimal solution because it results in the smallest possible integer.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long appendKIntegers(long long num, int k) {
        // Append k zeros to num
        long long smallestInteger = num;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            smallestInteger *= 10;
        }
        
        return smallestInteger;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k)$, because we are appending `k` zeros to `num`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the smallest integer.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is linear in `k` because we are appending `k` zeros, and the space complexity is constant because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the necessary variables.
