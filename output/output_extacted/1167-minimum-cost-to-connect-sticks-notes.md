## Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-connect-sticks/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a list of stick lengths, where each stick length is a positive integer. The list is guaranteed to have at least two sticks.
- Expected output format: The minimum cost to connect all sticks.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The sticks are connected in a way that minimizes the total cost. The cost of connecting two sticks is the sum of their lengths.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the minimum cost to connect all sticks is `10`, which is achieved by connecting the sticks in the following order: `(1 + 2) + (3 + 4) = 3 + 7 = 10`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible ways to connect the sticks and calculating the total cost for each way.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Generate all permutations of the stick lengths.
  2. For each permutation, calculate the total cost by connecting the sticks in the order specified by the permutation.
  3. Keep track of the minimum cost found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it is not efficient for large inputs because it has a high time complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int connectSticksBruteForce(vector<int>& sticks) {
    int n = sticks.size();
    int minCost = INT_MAX;
    sort(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());
    
    // Generate all permutations of the stick lengths
    do {
        int cost = 0;
        vector<int> temp = sticks;
        
        // Calculate the total cost for the current permutation
        while (temp.size() > 1) {
            int a = temp[0];
            int b = temp[1];
            cost += a + b;
            temp.erase(temp.begin());
            temp.erase(temp.begin());
            temp.push_back(a + b);
            sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());
        }
        
        // Update the minimum cost if the current cost is smaller
        minCost = min(minCost, cost);
    } while (next_permutation(sticks.begin(), sticks.end()));
    
    return minCost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n! \cdot n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of sticks. This is because we generate all permutations of the stick lengths, which takes $O(n!)$ time, and for each permutation, we calculate the total cost, which takes $O(n \log n)$ time due to the sorting step.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of sticks. This is because we need to store the stick lengths and the temporary sticks during the calculation.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity occurs because we try all possible ways to connect the sticks, which results in a large number of permutations. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the stick lengths and the temporary sticks during the calculation.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a priority queue to store the sticks and always connect the two sticks with the smallest lengths.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Create a priority queue to store the stick lengths.
  2. While there are more than one stick in the queue, remove the two sticks with the smallest lengths, connect them, and add the new stick back to the queue.
  3. The total cost is the sum of the costs of connecting the sticks at each step.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it always connects the two sticks with the smallest lengths, which minimizes the total cost.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is optimal because it uses a greedy strategy that always makes the locally optimal choice, which leads to the globally optimal solution.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int connectSticksOptimal(vector<int>& sticks) {
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
    
    // Add all stick lengths to the priority queue
    for (int stick : sticks) {
        pq.push(stick);
    }
    
    int minCost = 0;
    
    // Connect the sticks in the order of their lengths
    while (pq.size() > 1) {
        int a = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        int b = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        minCost += a + b;
        pq.push(a + b);
    }
    
    return minCost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of sticks. This is because we use a priority queue to store the stick lengths, and each insertion and removal operation takes $O(\log n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of sticks. This is because we need to store the stick lengths in the priority queue.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it always connects the two sticks with the smallest lengths, which minimizes the total cost.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Priority queue, greedy strategy.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a priority queue to solve problems that require making the locally optimal choice.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a greedy strategy to solve problems that have the optimal substructure property.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that can be solved using a priority queue and a greedy strategy, such as the Huffman coding problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not using a priority queue correctly, not handling the edge cases correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where there are only two sticks, the case where there are more than two sticks.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a priority queue, which can lead to a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the implementation with different inputs, including edge cases.
