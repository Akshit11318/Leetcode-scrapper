## XOR Operation in an Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/xor-operation-in-an-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a non-negative integer `n` and a non-negative integer `start`, return the XOR of all numbers in the range `[start, start + n)`. The XOR operation is performed on all elements in the array.
- Expected output format: A single integer representing the XOR of all numbers in the range.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where `n` is 0, `start` is 0, or `n` is larger than `start`.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - `n = 5, start = 0` returns `8` because `0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 8`
    - `n = 4, start = 3` returns `4` because `3 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 6 = 4`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward approach to solve this problem is to iterate over all numbers in the range `[start, start + n)` and perform the XOR operation on each number.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
    2. Iterate over the range `[start, start + n)`.
    3. For each number `i` in the range, perform the XOR operation with `result` and store the result back in `result`.
    4. After iterating over all numbers, return `result`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is the most intuitive because it directly follows the problem statement and performs the required XOR operation on all numbers in the range.

```cpp
int xorOperation(int n, int start) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result ^= (start + i);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ because we are iterating over the range `[start, start + n)` once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `result` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are performing a constant amount of work for each number in the range, and the space complexity is constant because we are only using a fixed amount of space to store the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can leverage the properties of the XOR operation to simplify the calculation. Specifically, we can use the fact that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a` to reduce the number of operations needed.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Initialize a variable `result` to `start`.
    2. Iterate over the range `[1, n)`.
    3. For each number `i` in the range, perform the XOR operation with `result` and `start + i`, and store the result back in `result`.
    4. After iterating over all numbers, return `result`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it still performs the required XOR operation on all numbers in the range, but it does so in a more efficient manner by reducing the number of operations needed.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the minimum required to perform the XOR operation on all numbers in the range.

```cpp
int xorOperation(int n, int start) {
    int result = start;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        result ^= (start + i);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `result` variable.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it still performs the required XOR operation on all numbers in the range, but it does so in a more efficient manner by reducing the number of operations needed.
