## Take Gifts From the Richest Pile

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/take-gifts-from-the-richest-pile/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `gifts` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= gifts.length <= 10^4`, `1 <= gifts[i] <= 10^4`, `1 <= k <= 10^4`.
- Expected Output: The maximum number of gifts that can be taken from the richest pile.
- Key Requirements: 
  - Take `k` gifts from the richest pile.
  - After taking gifts, the pile is no longer the richest.
- Edge Cases:
  - If `k` is greater than the number of gifts in the richest pile, take all gifts from the pile.
  - If there are multiple piles with the same maximum number of gifts, any of them can be considered the richest.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 2`, Output: `5`
- Input: `gifts = [10,5,3,4,2], k = 4`, Output: `4`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to repeatedly find the richest pile, take `k` gifts from it, and then remove the pile from consideration.
- This process is repeated until there are no more piles or no more gifts can be taken.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int pickGifts(std::vector<int>& gifts, int k) {
    while (k > 0) {
        // Find the index of the richest pile
        auto maxIndex = std::max_element(gifts.begin(), gifts.end()) - gifts.begin();
        
        // Take k gifts from the richest pile
        if (gifts[maxIndex] < k) {
            k -= gifts[maxIndex];
            gifts[maxIndex] = 0;
        } else {
            gifts[maxIndex] -= k;
            break;
        }
    }
    // Sum the remaining gifts
    return std::accumulate(gifts.begin(), gifts.end(), 0);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of piles. The `std::max_element` function takes $O(n)$ time, and this is repeated $k$ times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of space is used.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inefficient because it involves repeated searches for the maximum element and modifications to the input array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a priority queue (implemented as a max heap) to efficiently find and remove the richest pile.
- By maintaining a max heap, we can find the richest pile in $O(1)$ time and remove it in $O(\log n)$ time.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int pickGifts(std::vector<int>& gifts, int k) {
    std::priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
    for (int gift : gifts) {
        maxHeap.push(gift);
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        int maxGift = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        maxGift = (int)sqrt(maxGift);
        maxHeap.push(maxGift);
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
        sum += maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + k \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of piles. Building the max heap takes $O(n \log n)$ time, and each removal and insertion operation takes $O(\log n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as the max heap stores $n$ elements.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to find and remove the richest pile, leveraging the efficiency of the max heap data structure.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of choosing the right data structure for the problem, in this case, a max heap.
- The trade-off between time and space complexity, as the optimal approach uses more space to achieve better time complexity.
- The application of heap operations (insertion, removal, and peeking) to solve problems involving priority queues.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the use of a max heap or other efficient data structures.
- Incorrectly implementing heap operations, leading to incorrect results or performance issues.
- Failing to account for edge cases, such as an empty input array or a value of `k` that exceeds the number of gifts.
