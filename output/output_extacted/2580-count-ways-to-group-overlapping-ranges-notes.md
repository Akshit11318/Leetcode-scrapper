## Count Ways to Group Overlapping Ranges
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-group-overlapping-ranges/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of intervals, each interval is a pair of integers `[start, end]` where `start < end`. The task is to count the number of ways to group these intervals into non-overlapping groups.
- Expected output format: The function should return the total number of ways to group the intervals.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Intervals can be overlapping, and the order of intervals does not matter. If an interval overlaps with any interval in a group, it cannot be in the same group.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `[[1,3],[2,3],[3,4]]`, Output: `2`. Explanation: We can group them into `[[1,3],[2,3]]` and `[[3,4]]`, or `[[1,3],[3,4]]` and `[[2,3]]`.
  - Example 2: Input: `[[1,3],[1,4],[2,4]]`, Output: `1`. Explanation: All intervals overlap, so they must be in the same group.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of grouping the intervals.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of the intervals.
  2. For each subset, check if the intervals can be grouped into non-overlapping groups.
  3. Count the number of valid groupings.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most straightforward approach, but it is not efficient for large inputs.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int countWaysToGroupOverlappingRanges(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& intervals) {
    int n = intervals.size();
    int count = 0;
    
    // Generate all possible subsets
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> subset;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                subset.push_back(intervals[i]);
            }
        }
        
        // Check if the subset can be grouped into non-overlapping groups
        bool valid = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < subset.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < subset.size(); j++) {
                if (subset[i][1] > subset[j][0] && subset[j][1] > subset[i][0]) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!valid) break;
        }
        
        if (valid) count++;
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of intervals. This is because we generate all possible subsets of the intervals and check each subset for validity.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of intervals. This is because we need to store the current subset of intervals.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are generating all possible subsets of the intervals, which has an exponential number of possibilities. The space complexity is relatively low because we only need to store the current subset of intervals.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We can sort the intervals by their end points and then use a DP array to store the number of ways to group the intervals up to each point.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the intervals by their end points.
  2. Initialize a DP array `dp` of size `n`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to group the intervals up to the `i`-th interval.
  3. For each interval, find the last interval that does not overlap with it and update the DP array accordingly.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int countWaysToGroupOverlappingRanges(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& intervals) {
    int n = intervals.size();
    std::sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
        return a[1] < b[1];
    });
    
    std::vector<int> dp(n, 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (intervals[j][1] <= intervals[i][0]) {
                dp[i] += dp[j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    return *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of intervals. This is because we need to iterate over all intervals and for each interval, we need to find the last non-overlapping interval.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of intervals. This is because we need to store the DP array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, sorting, and iteration.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Finding the last non-overlapping interval and updating the DP array accordingly.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve grouping or partitioning, such as the "Partition Equal Subset Sum" problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not sorting the intervals correctly, not initializing the DP array correctly, and not updating the DP array correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input, intervals with the same end point, and intervals with the same start point.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach, not using dynamic programming, and not optimizing the iteration.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases, and verify that the output is correct.
