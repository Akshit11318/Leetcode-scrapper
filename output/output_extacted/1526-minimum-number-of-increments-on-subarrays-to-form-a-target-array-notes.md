## Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-increments-on-subarrays-to-form-a-target-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: `target` array of integers
- Constraints: `1 <= target.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= target[i] <= 10^5`
- Expected output format: Minimum number of increments required to form the target array
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    * All elements in the target array are positive integers
    * The target array may contain duplicate elements
    * The minimum number of increments is the minimum number of operations required to form the target array
- Example test cases with explanations:
    * `target = [3,1,4,2]`, minimum number of increments is `4` (increment the first element by `2`, the second element by `1`, the third element by `3`, and the fourth element by `1`)
    * `target = [3,1,4,2,5]`, minimum number of increments is `7` (increment the first element by `2`, the second element by `1`, the third element by `3`, the fourth element by `1`, and the fifth element by `2`)

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of increments for each element in the target array
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize a variable `result` to store the minimum number of increments
    2. Iterate over all possible combinations of increments for each element in the target array
    3. For each combination, calculate the number of increments required to form the target array
    4. Update `result` with the minimum number of increments found so far
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible combinations of increments

```cpp
int minNumberOperations(vector<int>& target) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < target.size(); i++) {
        result += target[i];
        if (i > 0) {
            result -= target[i - 1];
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the target array
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the result
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we only iterate over the target array once, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the result

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can calculate the minimum number of increments required to form the target array by summing up the differences between each element and its previous element
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Initialize a variable `result` to store the minimum number of increments
    2. Iterate over the target array, starting from the second element
    3. For each element, calculate the difference between the current element and its previous element
    4. Add the difference to `result`
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it calculates the minimum number of increments required to form the target array in a single pass
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a linear time complexity, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem

```cpp
int minNumberOperations(vector<int>& target) {
    int result = target[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < target.size(); i++) {
        if (target[i] > target[i - 1]) {
            result += target[i] - target[i - 1];
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it calculates the minimum number of increments required to form the target array in a single pass

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, calculation of differences between elements
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Calculating the minimum number of operations required to form a target array
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a single pass to calculate the minimum number of increments
- Similar problems to practice: Minimum number of operations to form a target string, minimum number of swaps to sort an array

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the result variable correctly, not handling the edge case where the target array has only one element
- Edge cases to watch for: Target array has only one element, target array is empty
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach, not using a single pass to calculate the minimum number of increments
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different target arrays, including edge cases and large inputs
