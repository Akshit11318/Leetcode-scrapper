## Minimum Operations to Maximize Last Elements in Arrays
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-maximize-last-elements-in-arrays/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array `nums` of integers.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.
- Expected Output: The minimum number of operations to maximize the last elements in the arrays.
- Key Requirements: Find the minimum number of operations to maximize the last elements in the arrays.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `nums = [3,2,1,4]`, the output should be `2`.
  - `nums = [1,2,3,4]`, the output should be `0`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of operations to maximize the last elements in the arrays.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize a variable `minOperations` to store the minimum number of operations.
  2. Iterate over the array `nums` and for each element, calculate the number of operations required to maximize it.
  3. Update `minOperations` if the current number of operations is less than the stored value.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and tries to solve the problem by brute force.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int minOperations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
                minOperations += nums[i] - nums[i + 1];
            }
        }
        return minOperations;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array `nums`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `minOperations` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we only iterate over the array once, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We only need to consider the differences between adjacent elements in the array.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a variable `minOperations` to store the minimum number of operations.
  2. Iterate over the array `nums` and for each element, calculate the difference between the current element and the next element.
  3. If the difference is positive, add it to `minOperations`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we only consider the necessary operations to maximize the last elements in the arrays.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int minOperations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
                minOperations += nums[i] - nums[i + 1];
            }
        }
        return minOperations;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array `nums`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `minOperations` variable.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we only consider the necessary operations to maximize the last elements in the arrays, and we do so in a single pass over the input array.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, comparison, and accumulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Finding the minimum number of operations to achieve a goal.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to initialize variables, using incorrect loop bounds.
