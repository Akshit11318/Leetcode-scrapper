## Count the Number of Powerful Integers

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-powerful-integers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given two positive integers `x` and `y`, and a limit `bound`, return the number of powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to `bound`.
- A powerful integer is defined in the problem statement as an integer that can be expressed as `x^i + y^j` for some non-negative integers `i` and `j`.
- The input format is `x`, `y`, and `bound`, all of which are positive integers.
- The expected output is the count of powerful integers less than or equal to `bound`.
- Key requirements include handling large values of `x`, `y`, and `bound`, and considering edge cases such as when `x` or `y` is 1.

**Example Test Cases:**
- For `x = 2`, `y = 3`, and `bound = 5`, the powerful integers are `2^0 + 3^0 = 1`, `2^0 + 3^1 = 4`, and `2^1 + 3^0 = 3`. Thus, the output should be 3.
- For `x = 3`, `y = 5`, and `bound = 15`, the powerful integers are `3^0 + 5^0 = 1`, `3^0 + 5^1 = 6`, `3^1 + 5^0 = 4`, `3^1 + 5^1 = 8`, `3^0 + 5^2 = 26` (which exceeds the bound), and others. The output should count those not exceeding the bound.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves iterating over all possible combinations of non-negative integers `i` and `j`, calculating `x^i + y^j`, and checking if the result is less than or equal to `bound`.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly implements the definition of a powerful integer and counts them according to the problem statement.

```cpp
int powerfulIntegers(int x, int y, int bound) {
    unordered_set<int> powerful;
    for (int i = 0; x == 1 ? i < 1 : pow(x, i) <= bound; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; y == 1 ? j < 1 : pow(y, j) <= bound; j++) {
            int val = pow(x, i) + pow(y, j);
            if (val <= bound) {
                powerful.insert(val);
            } else {
                break; // Since y^j will only increase from here
            }
        }
        if (x == 1) break; // No need to continue if x is 1
    }
    return powerful.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log_{x}bound \cdot \log_{y}bound)$, considering the loops over `i` and `j`. This is because the number of iterations for `i` and `j` are proportional to the logarithm of `bound` with bases `x` and `y`, respectively.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(\log_{x}bound \cdot \log_{y}bound)$, due to the storage of unique powerful integers in the `powerful` set.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity arises from the nested loops, while the space complexity comes from storing unique powerful integers to avoid double counting.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is recognizing that the brute force approach already implements an optimal strategy by only considering combinations of `x^i` and `y^j` that could potentially be less than or equal to `bound`.
- The detailed breakdown involves ensuring that we stop iterating over `i` and `j` as soon as `x^i` or `y^j` exceeds `bound`, thus avoiding unnecessary computations.
- This is proven to be optimal because any further reduction in computation would require skipping potential powerful integers, risking an incomplete count.

```cpp
int powerfulIntegers(int x, int y, int bound) {
    unordered_set<int> powerful;
    for (int i = 0; x == 1 ? i < 1 : pow(x, i) <= bound; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; y == 1 ? j < 1 : pow(y, j) <= bound; j++) {
            int val = pow(x, i) + pow(y, j);
            if (val <= bound) {
                powerful.insert(val);
            } else {
                break; // Since y^j will only increase from here
            }
        }
        if (x == 1) break; // No need to continue if x is 1
    }
    return powerful.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log_{x}bound \cdot \log_{y}bound)$, due to the optimized iteration over `i` and `j`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(\log_{x}bound \cdot \log_{y}bound)$, for storing unique powerful integers.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it considers all possible powerful integers without unnecessary computations, ensuring a complete and efficient count.
