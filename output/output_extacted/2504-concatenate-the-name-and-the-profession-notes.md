## Concatenate the Name and the Profession

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenate-the-name-and-the-profession/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given a table `Person` with columns `id`, `name`, and `profession`.
- Constraints: The `id` is the primary key of the table.
- Expected output format: A single column `concat_name_profession` that contains the concatenated string of `name` and `profession` in the format `name : profession`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where `name` or `profession` might be `NULL`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Test case 1: When `name` and `profession` are not `NULL`, the output should be in the format `name : profession`.
  - Test case 2: When `name` is `NULL`, the output should be `NULL : profession`.
  - Test case 3: When `profession` is `NULL`, the output should be `name : NULL`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The problem seems to require a simple string concatenation. However, we need to handle `NULL` values.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Select the `name` and `profession` columns from the `Person` table.
  2. Use a string concatenation function to combine `name` and `profession` with ` : ` in between.
  3. Handle `NULL` values by replacing them with an empty string or a specific placeholder.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the requirement of concatenating `name` and `profession`.

```cpp
SELECT 
    CONCAT_WS(' : ', name, profession) AS concat_name_profession
FROM 
    Person;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Person` table. This is because we are performing a single operation (concatenation) for each row.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we are creating a new column for the concatenated string.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves iterating over each row in the table and performing a simple string operation, which results in linear time and space complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using SQL's built-in string concatenation functions, which handle `NULL` values efficiently.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use `CONCAT_WS` function, which automatically handles `NULL` values by ignoring them and not adding the separator.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly uses the database's built-in functions, which are optimized for performance.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The problem requires accessing each row at least once to perform the concatenation, making the linear time complexity optimal.

```cpp
SELECT 
    CONCAT_WS(' : ', name, profession) AS concat_name_profession
FROM 
    Person;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Person` table.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we are creating a new column for the concatenated string.
> - **Optimality proof:** The use of `CONCAT_WS` ensures that we are using the most efficient method provided by SQL for concatenating strings with a separator and handling `NULL` values.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Handling `NULL` values in SQL, using `CONCAT_WS` for string concatenation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Directly applying built-in database functions for efficiency.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using the most appropriate SQL functions for the task at hand.
- Similar problems to practice: Other SQL problems involving string manipulation and `NULL` value handling.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling `NULL` values properly, using incorrect concatenation functions.
- Edge cases to watch for: `NULL` values in either the `name` or `profession` columns.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient string concatenation methods or not leveraging database functions.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various combinations of `NULL` and non-`NULL` values in the input columns.
