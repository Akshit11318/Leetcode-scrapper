## Build Array from Permutation

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums` of length `n`, where `nums[i]` is a permutation of the integers from `0` to `n-1`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 1000`, `0 <= nums[i] <= n-1`.
- Expected Output: An integer array `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The input array `nums` is a permutation of integers from `0` to `n-1`, meaning each number appears exactly once.
  - The output array `ans` is constructed by using the elements of `nums` as indices to access `nums` itself.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]`
    - Explanation: `ans[0] = nums[nums[0]] = nums[0] = 0`, `ans[1] = nums[nums[1]] = nums[2] = 1`, and so on.
    - Output: `[0,1,2,4,5,3]`
  - Input: `nums = [5,0,1,2,3,4]`
    - Explanation: `ans[0] = nums[nums[0]] = nums[5] = 4`, `ans[1] = nums[nums[1]] = nums[0] = 5`, and so on.
    - Output: `[4,5,0,1,2,3]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Directly use the given indices to access the `nums` array and construct the `ans` array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty array `ans` of the same length as `nums`.
  2. Iterate over each index `i` in `nums`.
  3. For each `i`, use `nums[i]` as the index to access `nums` and assign the result to `ans[i]`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the problem statement and does not require any additional data structures or complex algorithms.

```cpp
vector<int> buildArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> ans(nums.size());
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        ans[i] = nums[nums[i]];
    }
    return ans;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`, because we iterate over `nums` once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we create an additional array `ans` of the same length as `nums`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a constant amount of work for each element in `nums`. The space complexity is also linear due to the creation of the `ans` array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same insight as the brute force approach, as the problem directly asks for a transformation of the input array based on its own elements.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach is identical to the brute force approach in this case because the problem requires a straightforward transformation that does not lend itself to optimization through additional data structures or algorithms.
- Proof of optimality: This is the optimal solution because it achieves the required transformation in a single pass through the input array, which is the minimum number of operations necessary to construct the output array.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because any solution must at least read the input array and write the output array, which requires at least $O(n)$ time.

```cpp
vector<int> buildArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> ans(nums.size());
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        ans[i] = nums[nums[i]];
    }
    return ans;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we create an additional array `ans` of the same length as `nums`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it performs the minimum necessary work to achieve the required transformation.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Direct array transformation based on the array's own elements.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Recognizing when a problem can be solved through a straightforward, linear pass through the input data.
- Optimization techniques learned: Understanding that not all problems can be optimized beyond a straightforward approach, especially when the problem statement directly dictates the necessary operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other array transformation problems, such as rotating an array or finding elements based on certain conditions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Off-by-one errors when indexing arrays, or forgetting to initialize the output array.
- Edge cases to watch for: Although the problem statement guarantees that `nums` is a permutation of integers from `0` to `n-1`, in general, it's crucial to consider what happens if the input array is empty or contains invalid indices.
- Performance pitfalls: Assuming that every problem can be optimized beyond a straightforward approach, which can lead to overcomplicating simple solutions.
- Testing considerations: Always test with edge cases, such as an empty input array or an array with a single element, to ensure the solution works correctly under all expected conditions.
