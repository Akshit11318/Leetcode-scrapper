## Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `colors` and an array of integers `neededTime`.
- Constraints: `1 <= colors.length <= 10^5`, `neededTime.length == colors.length`, `0 <= neededTime[i] <= 10^6`.
- Expected Output: The minimum time required to make the rope colorful.
- Key Requirements: Calculate the minimum time by considering the removal of balloons of the same color.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]`: The minimum time required is `3`.
  - `colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]`: The minimum time required is `0`.
  - `colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]`: The minimum time required is `3`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over the string and array, and for each sequence of the same color, calculate the minimum time required by removing the balloon with the minimum `neededTime`.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize a variable `totalTime` to store the minimum time required.
  2. Iterate over the string and array.
  3. For each sequence of the same color, calculate the minimum time required by removing the balloon with the minimum `neededTime`.
  4. Add the minimum time required to `totalTime`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that considers all possible sequences of the same color.

```cpp
int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& neededTime) {
    int totalTime = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < colors.size()) {
        int j = i + 1;
        vector<int> times;
        while (j < colors.size() && colors[j] == colors[i]) {
            times.push_back(neededTime[j]);
            j++;
        }
        if (times.size() > 0) {
            sort(times.begin(), times.end());
            for (int k = 0; k < times.size() - 1; k++) {
                totalTime += times[k];
            }
        }
        i = j;
    }
    return totalTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string, due to the sorting operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string, for storing the `times` vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The sorting operation causes the time complexity to be $O(n \log n)$, and the `times` vector causes the space complexity to be $O(n)$.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of sorting the `neededTime` values for each sequence of the same color, we can keep track of the maximum `neededTime` value and subtract the sum of the other `neededTime` values from it.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a variable `totalTime` to store the minimum time required.
  2. Iterate over the string and array.
  3. For each sequence of the same color, calculate the minimum time required by subtracting the sum of the `neededTime` values from the maximum `neededTime` value.
  4. Add the minimum time required to `totalTime`.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a linear time complexity and uses a constant amount of extra space, making it optimal.

```cpp
int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& neededTime) {
    int totalTime = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < colors.size()) {
        int j = i;
        int sum = neededTime[i];
        int maxVal = neededTime[i];
        while (j + 1 < colors.size() && colors[j + 1] == colors[i]) {
            j++;
            sum += neededTime[j];
            maxVal = max(maxVal, neededTime[j]);
        }
        if (j > i) {
            totalTime += sum - maxVal;
        }
        i = j + 1;
    }
    return totalTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach has a linear time complexity and uses a constant amount of extra space, making it optimal.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a two-pointer technique to iterate over the string and array.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary sorting operations and using a more efficient approach to calculate the minimum time required.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating the minimum time required or failing to handle edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty strings or arrays, or sequences of the same color with only one element.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient approach with a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with different input cases to ensure correctness.
