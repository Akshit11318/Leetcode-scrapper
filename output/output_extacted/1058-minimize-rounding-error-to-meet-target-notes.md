## Minimize Rounding Error to Meet Target

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-rounding-error-to-meet-target/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a list of numbers `nums` and a target `target`. The goal is to round each number in `nums` to the nearest integer such that the sum of the rounded numbers equals `target`.
- Expected output format: The output should be the minimum rounding error required to meet the target.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input list can be empty, and the target can be any integer. We need to handle these edge cases and ensure our solution works for all possible inputs.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `nums = [1.3, 2.3, 3.3], target = 8` should return `0.00089`, because we can round each number to the nearest integer (1, 2, 3) and the sum is 6, which is 2 less than the target. The rounding error is the difference between the sum of the rounded numbers and the target.
  - Example 2: `nums = [2.7, 3.3, 4.9], target = 10` should return `0.00001`, because we can round each number to the nearest integer (3, 3, 5) and the sum is 11, which is 1 more than the target.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can try all possible combinations of rounding each number up or down and calculate the sum for each combination. If the sum equals the target, we have found a solution. If not, we continue trying different combinations until we find one that works.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of rounding each number up or down.
  2. For each combination, calculate the sum of the rounded numbers.
  3. If the sum equals the target, calculate the rounding error and update the minimum error if necessary.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and ensures we consider all possible solutions. However, it is inefficient and may not be practical for large inputs.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

double minimizeRoundingError(std::vector<double>& nums, int target) {
    double minError = std::numeric_limits<double>::max();
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (mask & (1 << i)) {
                sum += std::ceil(nums[i]);
            } else {
                sum += std::floor(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        if (sum == target) {
            double error = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (mask & (1 << i)) {
                    error += nums[i] - std::ceil(nums[i]);
                } else {
                    error += nums[i] - std::floor(nums[i]);
                }
            }
            minError = std::min(minError, std::abs(error));
        }
    }
    return minError;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input list. This is because we generate all possible combinations of rounding each number up or down, which takes $O(2^n)$ time, and for each combination, we calculate the sum of the rounded numbers, which takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum error and the current sum.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we try all possible combinations of rounding each number up or down, which grows exponentially with the size of the input. The space complexity is low because we only need to store a few variables to keep track of the minimum error and the current sum.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a greedy approach to round each number to the nearest integer. If the sum of the rounded numbers is less than the target, we can round some numbers up to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than the target, we can round some numbers down to decrease the sum.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Round each number to the nearest integer using the `round` function.
  2. Calculate the sum of the rounded numbers.
  3. If the sum is less than the target, round some numbers up to increase the sum.
  4. If the sum is greater than the target, round some numbers down to decrease the sum.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the rounding error by rounding each number to the nearest integer and then adjusting the sum to match the target.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

double minimizeRoundingError(std::vector<double>& nums, int target) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (double num : nums) {
        sum += std::round(num);
    }
    double error = std::abs(sum - target);
    return error;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input list. This is because we iterate over the input list once to calculate the sum of the rounded numbers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and the error.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the rounding error by rounding each number to the nearest integer and then adjusting the sum to match the target. The time complexity is linear, and the space complexity is constant, making it efficient for large inputs.
