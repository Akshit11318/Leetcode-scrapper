## Count Triplets with Even XOR Set Bits II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-triplets-with-even-xor-set-bits-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: We are given an integer array `arr` of size `n`.
- Expected output format: The task is to count the number of triplets `(i, j, k)` in the array such that `i < j < k` and the XOR of the set bits of `arr[i]`, `arr[j]`, and `arr[k]` is even.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array can contain duplicates, and we should consider all possible triplets that satisfy the given condition.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if `arr = [2, 3, 1, 6, 7]`, we need to count all triplets where `i < j < k` and the XOR of the set bits of `arr[i]`, `arr[j]`, and `arr[k]` is even.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward approach is to generate all possible triplets from the array and check if the XOR of the set bits of each triplet is even.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible triplets `(i, j, k)` from the array where `i < j < k`.
  2. For each triplet, calculate the XOR of the set bits of `arr[i]`, `arr[j]`, and `arr[k]`.
  3. Check if the XOR of the set bits is even. If it is, increment the count of triplets.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward because it directly addresses the problem statement by generating all possible triplets and checking the condition for each one.

```cpp
int countTriplets(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                int setBitsXOR = (__builtin_popcount(arr[i]) ^ __builtin_popcount(arr[j]) ^ __builtin_popcount(arr[k]));
                if (setBitsXOR % 2 == 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we are generating all possible triplets from the array, which results in a cubic time complexity.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space required for the input array. This is because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the count of triplets and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is cubic because we have three nested loops to generate all possible triplets. The space complexity is constant because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Notice that the XOR of the set bits of three numbers is even if and only if either all three numbers have an even number of set bits or exactly one of them has an even number of set bits. We can use this property to count the number of triplets more efficiently.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Count the number of elements in the array with even and odd set bits separately.
  2. Calculate the number of triplets where all three elements have even set bits using combinations.
  3. Calculate the number of triplets where exactly one element has even set bits using combinations.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it reduces the time complexity from cubic to quadratic by avoiding the generation of all possible triplets.

```cpp
int countTriplets(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int evenCount = 0, oddCount = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        if (__builtin_popcount(num) % 2 == 0) {
            evenCount++;
        } else {
            oddCount++;
        }
    }
    
    long long count = 0;
    // All three elements have even set bits
    count += (long long)evenCount * (evenCount - 1) * (evenCount - 2) / 6;
    
    // Exactly one element has even set bits
    count += (long long)evenCount * oddCount * (oddCount - 1) / 2;
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we are scanning the array once to count the number of elements with even and odd set bits.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space required for the input array. This is because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the counts and other variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it avoids the generation of all possible triplets and instead uses mathematical combinations to count the number of triplets, resulting in a linear time complexity.
