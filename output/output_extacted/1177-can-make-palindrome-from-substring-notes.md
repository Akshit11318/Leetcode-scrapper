## Can Make Palindrome from Substring
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/can-make-palindrome-from-substring/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` and a list of integers `queries`.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`.
- Expected Output: A list of boolean values where each value corresponds to whether the substring specified by the query can be rearranged into a palindrome.
- Key Requirements: Determine for each query if the characters in the specified substring can be rearranged to form a palindrome.
- Example Test Cases:
  - Input: `s = "abcda", queries = [[0,4],[1,4]]`
  - Output: `[true,false]`
  - Explanation: For the first query, the substring is "abcda" which can be rearranged into "aabcdd" and then removing the extra 'b' and 'd' we get "aaca" and then removing one more 'a' and one 'c' we are left with "aa" which is a palindrome. For the second query, the substring is "bcd" which cannot be rearranged into a palindrome.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking each query by extracting the substring, sorting its characters, and then attempting to pair them up. If all characters can be paired (with possibly one character left unpaired), then the substring can be rearranged into a palindrome.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. For each query, extract the substring from `s`.
  2. Count the frequency of each character in the substring.
  3. Determine if more than one character appears an odd number of times. If so, the substring cannot be rearranged into a palindrome.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

vector<bool> canMakePali(const string& s, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<bool> results;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int start = query[0], end = query[1];
        unordered_map<char, int> charCount;
        for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
            charCount[s[i]]++;
        }
        int oddCount = 0;
        for (auto& pair : charCount) {
            if (pair.second % 2 != 0) {
                oddCount++;
            }
            if (oddCount > 1) {
                results.push_back(false);
                break;
            }
        }
        if (oddCount <= 1) {
            results.push_back(true);
        }
    }
    return results;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the number of queries and $m$ is the average length of the substrings. This is because for each query, we potentially iterate over the entire substring to count character frequencies.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$ for storing the character counts for each substring.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach requires iterating over each substring for every query, leading to the $O(n \cdot m)$ time complexity. The space complexity is due to the storage needed for character counts.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of counting character frequencies for each query, we can pre-process the string `s` to create a prefix sum array that tracks the count of each character up to each position. This allows us to calculate the frequency of characters in any substring in constant time.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Create a prefix sum array for each character in `s`.
  2. For each query, use the prefix sum array to calculate the frequency of each character in the substring.
  3. Check if more than one character appears an odd number of times.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

vector<bool> canMakePali(const string& s, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    int n = s.size();
    vector<vector<int>> prefixSum(26, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 26; ++j) {
            prefixSum[j][i + 1] = prefixSum[j][i];
        }
        prefixSum[s[i] - 'a'][i + 1]++;
    }
    
    vector<bool> results;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int start = query[0], end = query[1];
        int oddCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            int count = prefixSum[i][end + 1] - prefixSum[i][start];
            if (count % 2 != 0) {
                oddCount++;
            }
            if (oddCount > 1) {
                results.push_back(false);
                break;
            }
        }
        if (oddCount <= 1) {
            results.push_back(true);
        }
    }
    return results;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + 26 \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the length of the string and $m$ is the number of queries. The $O(n)$ term comes from creating the prefix sum array, and the $O(26 \cdot m)$ term comes from processing each query.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(26 \cdot n)$ for the prefix sum array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it reduces the time complexity of processing each query to constant time after a one-time pre-processing step, making it more efficient than the brute force approach for large inputs.
