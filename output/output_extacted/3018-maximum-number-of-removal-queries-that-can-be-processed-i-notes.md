## Maximum Number of Removal Queries That Can Be Processed I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-removal-queries-that-can-be-processed-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a 2D array `points` where `points[i] = [x, y]`, and an integer `radius`, we want to find the maximum number of points that can be covered by a circle of a given radius.
- Expected output format: Return the maximum number of points that can be covered.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    * The circle must cover all points that are within the given radius from its center.
    * The circle can be placed anywhere on the plane, not necessarily on a point.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    * Example 1: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]], radius = 1. The maximum number of points that can be covered is 1.
    * Example 2: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]], radius = 2. The maximum number of points that can be covered is 2.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each point, calculate the distance to all other points and check if they can be covered by a circle of the given radius.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Iterate over each point in the `points` array.
    2. For each point, iterate over all other points and calculate the distance between them.
    3. Check if the distance is less than or equal to the given radius. If it is, increment the count of covered points.
    4. Update the maximum count of covered points.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that checks all possible combinations of points.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, int radius) {
        int maxCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < points.size(); j++) {
                if (i == j) continue;
                int dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0];
                int dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1];
                if (dx * dx + dy * dy <= radius * radius) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            maxCount = max(maxCount, count);
        }
        return maxCount + 1; // add 1 because we're counting the center point as well
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where n is the number of points. This is because we're iterating over each point and checking the distance to all other points.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we're not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because of the nested loops, and the space complexity is constant because we're only using a few variables to store the count and maximum count.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the distance between points, such as using a `sqrt` function or a `hypot` function.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Iterate over each point in the `points` array.
    2. For each point, use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the distance to all other points.
    3. Check if the distance is less than or equal to the given radius. If it is, increment the count of covered points.
    4. Update the maximum count of covered points.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because we're using the most efficient algorithm to calculate the distance between points.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, int radius) {
        int maxCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < points.size(); j++) {
                if (i == j) continue;
                int dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0];
                int dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1];
                if (dx * dx + dy * dy <= radius * radius) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            maxCount = max(maxCount, count);
        }
        return maxCount + 1; // add 1 because we're counting the center point as well
    }
};
```

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as when the input array is empty.
- Edge cases to watch for: When the input array is empty, or when the radius is negative.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient algorithm to calculate the distance between points.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input sizes and edge cases to ensure it works correctly.
