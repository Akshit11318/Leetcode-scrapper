## Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-empty/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer array `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations to make the array empty.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array can be empty, and the minimum number of operations is 0 in this case.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`
      Output: `5`
      Explanation: Remove each element one by one.
    - Input: `nums = []`
      Output: `0`
      Explanation: The array is already empty.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over the array and count the number of elements.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a counter variable `count` to 0.
  2. Iterate over the array `nums`.
  3. For each element, increment the `count` variable.
  4. Return the `count` variable as the minimum number of operations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most straightforward way to count the number of elements in the array.

```cpp
int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, because we iterate over the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the counter variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we visit each element once, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The minimum number of operations is equal to the number of elements in the array.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Return the size of the input array `nums`.
- Proof of optimality: This is the most efficient way to count the number of elements in the array, as it does not require iterating over the array.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We cannot do better than $O(1)$ time complexity, as we must at least return the size of the array.

```cpp
int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    return nums.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we simply return the size of the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we do not use any additional space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because it has constant time complexity, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Array iteration, counter variables, and optimal solution using the `size()` function.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Counting the number of elements in an array.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using the `size()` function to avoid iterating over the array.
- Similar problems to practice: Counting the number of elements in a linked list or a tree.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to initialize the counter variable or not returning the correct value.
- Edge cases to watch for: An empty array, which should return 0.
- Performance pitfalls: Iterating over the array unnecessarily, which can lead to a higher time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with an empty array, an array with one element, and an array with multiple elements.
