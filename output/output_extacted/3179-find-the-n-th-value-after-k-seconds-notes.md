## Find the N-th Value After K Seconds
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-n-th-value-after-k-seconds/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given a 2D array `change`, where `change[i] = [row_i, col_i]` represents the cell `(row_i, col_i)` that will change its value.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= k <= 1000`, `0 <= row_i, col_i < n`.
- Expected output format: Return the value at the `n`-th cell after `k` seconds.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The initial grid is filled with zeros.
  - The value at the `i`-th cell is calculated as `(i-1) % 8 + 1`, where `i` is the index of the cell.
  - The grid is updated `k` times.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `n = 3, k = 2, change = [[0,0],[1,1]]` should return `2`.
  - `n = 5, k = 1, change = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]` should return `3`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Create a grid of size `n x n` and initialize it with zeros. Then, update the grid `k` times according to the given `change` array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a grid of size `n x n` and initialize it with zeros.
  2. Update the grid `k` times according to the given `change` array.
  3. Calculate the value at the `n`-th cell after `k` seconds.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward to simulate the process and calculate the value at the `n`-th cell after `k` seconds.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findNthValue(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>>& change) {
        vector<vector<int>> grid(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            for (auto& c : change) {
                grid[c[0]][c[1]] = (c[0] * n + c[1] + 1) % 8;
            }
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i * n + j + 1 == n) {
                    result = grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot m)$, where $m$ is the number of changes. This is because we update the grid `k` times and each update takes $O(m)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the size of the grid. This is because we need to store the grid.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we need to update the grid `k` times, and each update takes $O(m)$ time. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the grid.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The value at the `i`-th cell is calculated as `(i-1) % 8 + 1`, where `i` is the index of the cell. We can calculate the value at the `n`-th cell after `k` seconds without updating the grid.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the index of the `n`-th cell.
  2. Calculate the value at the `n`-th cell after `k` seconds.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we only need to calculate the value at the `n`-th cell after `k` seconds, without updating the grid.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because we only need to calculate the value at the `n`-th cell after `k` seconds.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findNthValue(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>>& change) {
        int result = (n - 1) % 8 + 1;
        
        for (auto& c : change) {
            if (c[0] * n + c[1] + 1 == n) {
                result = (c[0] * n + c[1] + 1) % 8;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the number of changes. This is because we only need to iterate over the `change` array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only need to store a few variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we only need to calculate the value at the `n`-th cell after `k` seconds, without updating the grid.
