## Check If An Original String Exists Given Two Encoded Strings
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-an-original-string-exists-given-two-encoded-strings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes two encoded strings `s1` and `s2` as input, where each encoded string consists of lowercase letters and numbers. The numbers represent the count of consecutive occurrences of the preceding letter.
- Expected output format: The function should return `true` if there exists an original string that could have produced both `s1` and `s2` through the encoding process, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The input strings `s1` and `s2` can have different lengths.
  - The input strings can contain consecutive occurrences of the same letter.
  - The input strings can contain numbers that are not valid counts (e.g., a number that is not a digit or a number that is greater than the number of remaining characters).
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `s1 = "a1b2c3", s2 = "a1b2c3"`: Returns `true` because both strings can be decoded into the same original string "abc".
  - `s1 = "a1b2c3", s2 = "a2b1c3"`: Returns `false` because the decoded strings are different.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves generating all possible original strings from `s1` and `s2` by decoding the encoded strings, and then checking if the decoded strings are equal.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Write a function to decode an encoded string into an original string.
  2. Use this function to decode `s1` and `s2`.
  3. Compare the decoded strings and return `true` if they are equal, and `false` otherwise.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it may not be efficient for large input strings.

```cpp
bool possiblyEquals(string s1, string s2) {
    // Function to decode an encoded string
    string decode(string encoded) {
        string result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < encoded.size(); i++) {
            if (isdigit(encoded[i])) {
                int count = encoded[i] - '0';
                result += string(count, encoded[i-1]);
            } else {
                result += encoded[i];
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    // Decode s1 and s2
    string decodedS1 = decode(s1);
    string decodedS2 = decode(s2);

    // Compare the decoded strings
    return decodedS1 == decodedS2;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, respectively, because we need to iterate over both strings to decode them.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, because we need to store the decoded strings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time and space complexities occur because we need to iterate over the input strings and store the decoded strings.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of decoding the entire strings, we can compare the strings character by character and count the differences.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize two pointers, one for each string.
  2. Compare the characters at the current positions of the pointers.
  3. If the characters are equal, move both pointers forward.
  4. If the characters are not equal, increment the count of differences.
  5. If the count of differences exceeds 1, return `false`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the input strings, and it uses a constant amount of space to store the count of differences.

```cpp
bool possiblyEquals(string s1, string s2) {
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    int countDiff = 0;

    while (i < s1.size() && j < s2.size()) {
        if (s1[i] == s2[j]) {
            i++;
            j++;
        } else if (isdigit(s1[i])) {
            i += 2;
            countDiff++;
        } else if (isdigit(s2[j])) {
            j += 2;
            countDiff++;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return countDiff <= 1;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: string manipulation, character comparison, and difference counting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using two pointers to compare strings, and using a count to track differences.
- Optimization techniques learned: reducing the amount of space used by storing only the count of differences.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking for edge cases, such as empty strings or strings with only numbers.
- Edge cases to watch for: strings with consecutive occurrences of the same letter, and strings with numbers that are not valid counts.
- Performance pitfalls: using excessive space to store decoded strings, and using nested loops to compare strings.
