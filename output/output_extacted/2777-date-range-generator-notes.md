## Date Range Generator
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/date-range-generator/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/date-range-generator/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a string array `startDate` and `endDate`, representing the start and end dates in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". The task is to generate all dates between these two dates.
- Expected output format: A list of strings representing all dates between the start and end dates in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The start date should be less than or equal to the end date. If the start date is greater than the end date, return an empty list.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `startDate = ["2022-01-01"], endDate = ["2022-01-03"]` should return `["2022-01-01","2022-01-02","2022-01-03"]`.
  - `startDate = ["2022-01-01"], endDate = ["2022-01-01"]` should return `["2022-01-01"]`.
  - `startDate = ["2022-01-03"], endDate = ["2022-01-01"]` should return `[]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can iterate over all possible dates between the start and end dates and add them to the result list.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Parse the start and end dates into `struct tm` objects.
  2. Initialize an empty list to store the result dates.
  3. Iterate over all possible dates between the start and end dates using a `while` loop.
  4. In each iteration, format the current date into a string and add it to the result list.
  5. Increment the current date by one day.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <ctime>

std::vector<std::string> dateRangeGenerator(std::vector<std::string> startDate, std::vector<std::string> endDate) {
    // Parse the start and end dates into struct tm objects
    struct tm start, end;
    strptime(startDate[0].c_str(), "%Y-%m-%d", &start);
    strptime(endDate[0].c_str(), "%Y-%m-%d", &end);

    // Initialize an empty list to store the result dates
    std::vector<std::string> result;

    // Iterate over all possible dates between the start and end dates
    while (difftime(mktime(&start), mktime(&end)) <= 0) {
        // Format the current date into a string and add it to the result list
        char buffer[11];
        strftime(buffer, 11, "%Y-%m-%d", &start);
        result.push_back(buffer);

        // Increment the current date by one day
        start.tm_mday++;
        mktime(&start);
    }

    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of days between the start and end dates.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of days between the start and end dates.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating over all possible dates between the start and end dates. The space complexity occurs because we are storing all the result dates in a list.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach because we need to generate all dates between the start and end dates. However, we can use a more efficient way to increment the date by using the `time_t` type and the `mktime` function.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Parse the start and end dates into `struct tm` objects.
  2. Initialize an empty list to store the result dates.
  3. Iterate over all possible dates between the start and end dates using a `while` loop.
  4. In each iteration, format the current date into a string and add it to the result list.
  5. Increment the current date by one day using the `time_t` type and the `mktime` function.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because we need to generate all dates between the start and end dates, and we are doing it in a straightforward and efficient way.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <ctime>

std::vector<std::string> dateRangeGenerator(std::vector<std::string> startDate, std::vector<std::string> endDate) {
    // Parse the start and end dates into struct tm objects
    struct tm start, end;
    strptime(startDate[0].c_str(), "%Y-%m-%d", &start);
    strptime(endDate[0].c_str(), "%Y-%m-%d", &end);

    // Initialize an empty list to store the result dates
    std::vector<std::string> result;

    // Iterate over all possible dates between the start and end dates
    time_t start_time = mktime(&start);
    time_t end_time = mktime(&end);
    while (difftime(start_time, end_time) <= 0) {
        // Format the current date into a string and add it to the result list
        struct tm* current = localtime(&start_time);
        char buffer[11];
        strftime(buffer, 11, "%Y-%m-%d", current);
        result.push_back(buffer);

        // Increment the current date by one day
        start_time += 86400; // 86400 seconds in a day
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: date parsing, date increment, and iteration.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and solving them iteratively.
- Optimization techniques learned: using the `time_t` type and the `mktime` function to increment the date efficiently.
- Similar problems to practice: generating all dates between two dates in a specific format, generating all dates in a specific range, etc.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: incorrect date parsing, incorrect date increment, and incorrect iteration.
- Edge cases to watch for: start date greater than end date, start date equal to end date, etc.
- Performance pitfalls: using inefficient date increment methods, using inefficient iteration methods, etc.
- Testing considerations: testing with different start and end dates, testing with edge cases, etc.
