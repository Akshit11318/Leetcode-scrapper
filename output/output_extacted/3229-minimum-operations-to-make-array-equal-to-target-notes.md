## Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal to Target
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal-to-target/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an array `nums` and a target `target`, return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal to the target.
- The allowed operations are:
  - Increment an element by 1.
  - Decrement an element by 1.
- The input array `nums` contains `n` integers, and the target `target` is an integer.
- The expected output is the minimum number of operations required.
- Key requirements: The array can contain duplicate elements, and the target can be any integer.
- Edge cases: The array can be empty, or all elements can be equal to the target.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `nums = [3, 2, 5], target = 4` should return `2` because we can increment `2` to `4` and decrement `5` to `4`.
- `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 3` should return `6` because we need to perform multiple operations to make all elements equal to `3`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate over the array and calculate the absolute difference between each element and the target.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement by considering each element individually.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            operations += abs(num - target);
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we iterate over the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, which means the space required does not grow with the size of the input array, making it constant.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear due to the single pass through the array, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is recognizing that the minimum number of operations is directly related to the sum of the absolute differences between each element and the target.
- This is because each operation (increment or decrement) affects the difference between an element and the target by 1.
- The optimal solution is essentially the same as the brute force approach because it already achieves the minimum time complexity required to solve the problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            operations += abs(num - target);
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is optimal because we must at least look at each element once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, indicating constant space usage.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations by directly calculating the required differences without any unnecessary steps or redundant calculations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The key algorithmic concept demonstrated here is the use of absolute differences to calculate the minimum number of operations.
- A problem-solving pattern identified is the importance of understanding the problem constraints and operations allowed.
- The optimization technique learned is recognizing when a straightforward approach is already optimal due to the nature of the problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- A common implementation error could be incorrectly calculating the absolute differences or misinterpreting the problem constraints.
- Edge cases to watch for include handling empty arrays or arrays with all elements already equal to the target.
- Performance pitfalls could involve using more complex data structures or algorithms than necessary, leading to increased time or space complexity.
