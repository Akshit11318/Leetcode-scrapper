## Employees Project Allocation
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-project-allocation/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: You are given a table `Employees` with columns `EmployeeID`, `ProjectID`, and `ProjectStartDate`. 
- Expected output format: Find the maximum number of employees that can be allocated to a project.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - Each employee can only work on one project at a time.
    - An employee can work on multiple projects, but not at the same time.
    - If an employee is already working on a project, they cannot be allocated to another project until they finish the current one.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For example, if an employee is working on project A from day 1 to day 5, they cannot be allocated to project B until day 6.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to try all possible allocations of employees to projects and check which one results in the maximum number of employees.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Generate all possible allocations of employees to projects.
    2. For each allocation, check if it is valid (i.e., an employee is not working on two projects at the same time).
    3. If the allocation is valid, count the number of employees in the allocation.
    4. Keep track of the maximum number of employees found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it is not efficient because it has to try all possible allocations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Employee {
    int id;
    int projectId;
    int startDate;
    int endDate;
};

bool isValidAllocation(const std::vector<Employee>& employees) {
    // Check if an employee is working on two projects at the same time
    for (int i = 0; i < employees.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < employees.size(); j++) {
            if (employees[i].id == employees[j].id && 
                employees[i].startDate < employees[j].endDate && 
                employees[j].startDate < employees[i].endDate) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int maxEmployees(const std::vector<Employee>& employees) {
    int maxCount = 0;
    // Generate all possible allocations of employees to projects
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << employees.size()); i++) {
        std::vector<Employee> allocation;
        for (int j = 0; j < employees.size(); j++) {
            if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                allocation.push_back(employees[j]);
            }
        }
        if (isValidAllocation(allocation)) {
            maxCount = std::max(maxCount, (int)allocation.size());
        }
    }
    return maxCount;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of employees. This is because we generate all possible allocations of employees to projects and check each allocation in $O(n^2)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of employees. This is because we need to store the current allocation of employees to projects.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are trying all possible allocations of employees to projects and checking each allocation.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate employees to projects. We sort the employees by their start dates and then allocate them to projects in that order.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Sort the employees by their start dates.
    2. Initialize an empty allocation of employees to projects.
    3. Iterate over the sorted employees. For each employee, check if they can be allocated to a project without conflicting with other employees.
    4. If an employee can be allocated to a project, add them to the allocation.
- Proof of optimality: This algorithm is optimal because it always allocates the employee with the earliest start date to a project, which maximizes the number of employees that can be allocated.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Employee {
    int id;
    int projectId;
    int startDate;
    int endDate;
};

bool canBeAllocated(const Employee& employee, const std::vector<Employee>& allocation) {
    // Check if the employee conflicts with other employees in the allocation
    for (const auto& allocatedEmployee : allocation) {
        if (employee.id == allocatedEmployee.id && 
            employee.startDate < allocatedEmployee.endDate && 
            allocatedEmployee.startDate < employee.endDate) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int maxEmployees(const std::vector<Employee>& employees) {
    std::sort(employees.begin(), employees.end(), [](const Employee& a, const Employee& b) {
        return a.startDate < b.startDate;
    });
    std::vector<Employee> allocation;
    for (const auto& employee : employees) {
        if (canBeAllocated(employee, allocation)) {
            allocation.push_back(employee);
        }
    }
    return allocation.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of employees. This is because we sort the employees in $O(n \log n)$ time and then iterate over them to allocate them to projects in $O(n^2)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of employees. This is because we need to store the allocation of employees to projects.
> - **Optimality proof:** This algorithm is optimal because it always allocates the employee with the earliest start date to a project, which maximizes the number of employees that can be allocated.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy algorithms, sorting, and allocation problems.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm by sorting the employees by their start dates and then allocating them to projects in that order.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimal solution uses a greedy algorithm to allocate employees to projects, which maximizes the number of employees that can be allocated.
- Similar problems to practice: Other allocation problems, such as the knapsack problem or the bin packing problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for conflicts between employees when allocating them to projects.
- Edge cases to watch for: Employees with the same start date or employees with overlapping project dates.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach to try all possible allocations of employees to projects, which has a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the algorithm with different inputs, including edge cases and large inputs, to ensure that it works correctly and efficiently.
