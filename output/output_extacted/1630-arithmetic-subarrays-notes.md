## Arithmetic Subarrays
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-subarrays/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-subarrays/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an array `nums` and an array of indices `l` and `r` as input, where `l` and `r` are of the same length. The task is to determine whether the subarrays of `nums` specified by the indices in `l` and `r` are arithmetic sequences.
- Expected output format: The function should return a boolean array where the i-th element is `true` if the subarray `nums[l[i]...r[i]]` is an arithmetic sequence, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input array `nums` and the arrays `l` and `r` are non-empty and contain only non-negative integers. The indices in `l` and `r` are valid and refer to the array `nums`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `nums = [3, 5, 1, 0, 2]`, `l = [2, 4, 1]`, and `r = [4, 4, 4]`, the function should return `[true, false, true]`, because the subarrays `nums[2...4] = [1, 0, 2]` and `nums[1...4] = [5, 1, 0, 2]` are arithmetic sequences, but the subarray `nums[4...4] = [2]` is not.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To determine whether each subarray specified by the indices in `l` and `r` is an arithmetic sequence, we can calculate the difference between consecutive elements in each subarray and check if this difference is constant.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each pair of indices `(l[i], r[i])`.
  2. Extract the subarray `nums[l[i]...r[i]]`.
  3. Calculate the differences between consecutive elements in the subarray.
  4. Check if these differences are constant.
  5. If they are constant, mark the i-th element in the result array as `true`, otherwise mark it as `false`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement by checking each subarray individually.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<bool> checkArithmeticSubarrays(std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<int>& l, std::vector<int>& r) {
    std::vector<bool> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); ++i) {
        std::vector<int> subarray(nums.begin() + l[i], nums.begin() + r[i] + 1);
        if (subarray.size() <= 2) {
            result.push_back(true);
            continue;
        }
        int diff = subarray[1] - subarray[0];
        bool isArithmetic = true;
        for (int j = 2; j < subarray.size(); ++j) {
            if (subarray[j] - subarray[j - 1] != diff) {
                isArithmetic = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        result.push_back(isArithmetic);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the arrays `l` and `r`, and $m$ is the maximum length of a subarray. This is because for each pair of indices, we potentially scan the entire subarray to check if it's an arithmetic sequence.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, because in the worst case, we might need to store a subarray of length $m$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are scanning each subarray individually to check for the arithmetic property.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach can be optimized by directly calculating the difference between the first and second elements of each subarray and then checking if this difference is consistent throughout the subarray.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate over each pair of indices `(l[i], r[i])`.
  2. Calculate the difference between the first two elements of the subarray `nums[l[i]...r[i]]`.
  3. Check if this difference is consistent for all elements in the subarray.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to check if a subarray is an arithmetic sequence. It directly calculates the necessary differences and checks for consistency without unnecessary steps.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must at least check the difference between consecutive elements in each subarray to determine if it's an arithmetic sequence.

```cpp
std::vector<bool> checkArithmeticSubarrays(std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<int>& l, std::vector<int>& r) {
    std::vector<bool> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); ++i) {
        int left = l[i], right = r[i];
        if (right - left <= 1) {
            result.push_back(true);
            continue;
        }
        int diff = nums[left + 1] - nums[left];
        bool isArithmetic = true;
        for (int j = left + 2; j <= right; ++j) {
            if (nums[j] - nums[j - 1] != diff) {
                isArithmetic = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        result.push_back(isArithmetic);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the arrays `l` and `r`, and $m$ is the maximum length of a subarray. This remains the same as the brute force approach because we still need to potentially scan each subarray.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the output, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the difference and the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly addresses the problem with the minimum necessary operations, without any redundant calculations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Arithmetic sequences, array scanning, and difference calculation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct calculation and consistency checking.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minimizing unnecessary operations and using constant space.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving arithmetic sequences or array properties.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect indexing, missing edge cases (like subarrays of length 1 or 2), and not checking for consistency throughout the subarray.
- Edge cases to watch for: Subarrays of length 1 or 2, which are always arithmetic sequences.
- Performance pitfalls: Unnecessary operations or space usage, which can be avoided by directly calculating differences and checking consistency.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly test with various input sizes, edge cases, and different types of arithmetic sequences.
