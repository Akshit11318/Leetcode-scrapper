## Number of Sets of K Non-Overlapping Line Segments
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sets-of-k-non-overlapping-line-segments/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of `n` pairs of integers, where each pair represents a line segment, and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 4 * 10^4`, `1 <= k <= n`.
- Expected Output: The number of sets of `k` non-overlapping line segments.
- Key Requirements: Two line segments are considered non-overlapping if they do not share any common point.
- Edge Cases: Consider cases where `k` is 1, `k` equals `n`, or when no non-overlapping sets can be formed.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible combination of `k` line segments to see if they are non-overlapping.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all combinations of `k` line segments from the given array of `n` line segments.
  2. For each combination, check if any pair of line segments overlaps.
  3. Count the combinations where no overlap is found.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int countNonOverlapping(vector<vector<int>>& segments, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    vector<bool> used(segments.size(), false);
    // Function to check if two segments overlap
    auto overlaps = [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
        return max(a[0], b[0]) <= min(a[1], b[1]);
    };

    // Recursive function to generate combinations
    function<void(int, int, vector<int>&)> generateCombinations =
        [&](int start, int depth, vector<int>& currentCombination) {
            if (depth == k) {
                bool valid = true;
                for (int i = 0; i < currentCombination.size(); ++i) {
                    for (int j = i + 1; j < currentCombination.size(); ++j) {
                        if (overlaps(segments[currentCombination[i]], segments[currentCombination[j]])) {
                            valid = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    if (!valid) break;
                }
                if (valid) count++;
                return;
            }
            for (int i = start; i < segments.size(); ++i) {
                currentCombination.push_back(i);
                generateCombinations(i + 1, depth + 1, currentCombination);
                currentCombination.pop_back();
            }
        };

    vector<int> currentCombination;
    generateCombinations(0, 0, currentCombination);
    return count;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    vector<vector<int>> segments = {{1, 3}, {3, 5}, {6, 7}};
    int k = 2;
    cout << "Number of sets of non-overlapping line segments: " << countNonOverlapping(segments, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O\left(\binom{n}{k} \cdot k^2\right)$ due to generating all combinations of `k` segments and checking for overlaps within each combination.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the `used` array and the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves exhaustive enumeration of combinations and overlap checks, leading to high computational complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use dynamic programming to efficiently count the number of sets of non-overlapping line segments.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Sort the line segments by their end points.
  2. Initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of sets of non-overlapping line segments ending at or before the `i`-th segment.
  3. For each segment, consider including it in the current set if it does not overlap with the previously included segment.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int countNonOverlapping(vector<vector<int>>& segments, int k) {
    sort(segments.begin(), segments.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
        return a[1] < b[1];
    });

    vector<int> dp(segments.size() + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1; // Base case: one way to have 0 segments (choose none)

    for (int i = 1; i <= segments.size(); ++i) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]; // Not including the current segment
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (segments[j][1] <= segments[i - 1][0]) {
                dp[i] += dp[j];
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the number of sets of k non-overlapping segments
    vector<int> countK(segments.size() + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= segments.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (segments[j][1] <= segments[i - 1][0]) {
                countK[i] += countK[j];
            }
        }
        if (i == 1) countK[i] = 1; // Base case for k=1
    }

    int result = 0;
    for (int i = k; i <= segments.size(); ++i) {
        result += countK[i];
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    vector<vector<int>> segments = {{1, 3}, {3, 5}, {6, 7}};
    int k = 2;
    cout << "Number of sets of non-overlapping line segments: " << countNonOverlapping(segments, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ due to the nested loops for dynamic programming and sorting.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for the dynamic programming table.
> - **Optimality proof:** The dynamic programming approach efficiently counts the sets of non-overlapping line segments by avoiding redundant computations and ensuring that each segment is considered in the context of previously included segments.
