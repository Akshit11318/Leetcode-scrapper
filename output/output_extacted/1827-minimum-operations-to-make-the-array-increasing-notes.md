## Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-increasing/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: The length of `nums` is in the range `[1, 10^5]`, and each element is in the range `[0, 10^9]`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations to make the array increasing.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array must be strictly increasing after the operations.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - Example 1: Input: `nums = [1,1,1]`, Output: `3`. Explanation: You can do the following operations:
        1. Increase `nums[0]`, so it becomes `2`.
        2. Increase `nums[1]`, so it becomes `3`.
        3. Increase `nums[2]`, so it becomes `4`.
        Now the array `[2,3,4]` is strictly increasing.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through the array and for each element, keep incrementing it until it is greater than the previous element.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize a variable `operations` to 0.
    2. Iterate through the array `nums` from the second element to the end.
    3. For each element, if it is not greater than the previous element, increment it until it is greater.
    4. Increment `operations` by the number of increments made to the current element.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int operations = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
            int diff = nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1;
            nums[i] += diff;
            operations += diff;
        }
    }
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are iterating through the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are performing a constant amount of work for each element in the array, and the space complexity is constant because we are only using a fixed amount of space to store the `operations` variable.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same insight as the brute force approach, but implemented more efficiently.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The approach remains the same as the brute force approach, but we can prove that this is the optimal solution because we are only performing the necessary increments to make the array increasing.
- Proof of optimality: This is the optimal solution because we are only performing the minimum number of increments necessary to make the array increasing.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must make each element greater than the previous one, and our approach does this in the minimum number of operations.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int operations = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
            operations += nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1;
            nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }
    return operations;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we are only performing the minimum number of increments necessary to make the array increasing.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be solved by iterating through the array and making the necessary increments to each element.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimal solution is achieved by only performing the necessary increments to make the array increasing.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve making an array satisfy a certain condition by performing a minimum number of operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element before making the increments.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where the array is already increasing, in which case the function should return 0.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary loops or data structures that increase the time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with arrays of different sizes and with different initial values to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.
