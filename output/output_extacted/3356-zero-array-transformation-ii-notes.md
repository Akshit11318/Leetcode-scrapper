## Zero Array Transformation II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/zero-array-transformation-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a `0-indexed` integer array `nums`, return the resulting array after applying the following operation `k` times:
  - For each index `i`, if `nums[i]` is `0`, then multiply the adjacent elements (at indices `i - 1` and `i + 1`) by `2`. If an adjacent element doesn't exist, ignore it.
- Expected output format: The final array after applying the operation `k` times.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The array can contain zeros and non-zero elements.
  - The operation should be applied `k` times.
  - The input array can be empty.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `nums = [1,0,2,0,3,0,4]`, `k = 1`. The output should be `[2,0,4,0,6,0,8]`.
  - Example 2: `nums = [1,0,2,0,3,0,4]`, `k = 2`. The output should be `[4,0,8,0,12,0,16]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can iterate through the array and apply the operation `k` times. For each iteration, we check for zeros in the array and multiply the adjacent elements by `2`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a copy of the input array to store the result after each operation.
  2. Iterate `k` times.
  3. For each iteration, iterate through the array and check for zeros.
  4. If a zero is found, multiply the adjacent elements by `2`.
  5. Update the result array for the next iteration.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly applies the given operation `k` times.

```cpp
vector<int> transformArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<int> result = nums;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        vector<int> temp(result.size());
        for (int j = 0; j < result.size(); j++) {
            if (result[j] == 0) {
                if (j > 0) temp[j - 1] = result[j - 1] * 2;
                if (j < result.size() - 1) temp[j + 1] = result[j + 1] * 2;
            }
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < result.size(); j++) {
            if (temp[j] != 0) result[j] = temp[j];
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array and $k$ is the number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is $O(k \cdot n)$ because we iterate through the array $k$ times, and each iteration takes $O(n)$ time. The space complexity is $O(n)$ because we need to store the result array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The operation can be optimized by only considering the indices where the value is zero and updating the adjacent elements accordingly.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a copy of the input array to store the result after each operation.
  2. Iterate `k` times.
  3. For each iteration, iterate through the array and check for zeros.
  4. If a zero is found, multiply the adjacent elements by `2` and update the result array for the next iteration.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only considers the necessary updates and avoids redundant calculations.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The operation requires iterating through the array `k` times, and each iteration takes $O(n)$ time. Therefore, the time complexity cannot be improved further.

```cpp
vector<int> transformArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<int> result = nums;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        vector<int> temp(result.size());
        for (int j = 0; j < result.size(); j++) {
            if (result[j] == 0) {
                if (j > 0) temp[j - 1] = result[j - 1] * 2;
                if (j < result.size() - 1) temp[j + 1] = result[j + 1] * 2;
            } else {
                temp[j] = result[j];
            }
        }
        result = temp;
    }
    return result;
}
```
