## Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `n`.
- Expected output: The minimum number of operations to make `n` zero, where each operation is either `x = x * 2` or `x = x + 1`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - `n` is a non-negative integer.
  - Each operation must be applied to `x` until `x` becomes 0.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `n = 3`, the minimum number of operations is 2, by performing `x = x + 1` twice.
  - `n = 6`, the minimum number of operations is 5, by performing `x = x * 2` twice and `x = x + 1` three times.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of `x = x * 2` and `x = x + 1` operations.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a queue with `n`.
  2. Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) by dequeuing each number, applying both operations, and enqueuing the results.
  3. Keep track of the number of operations performed to reach each number.
  4. Stop when we reach 0 and return the number of operations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to explore all possible operations.

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {
        std::queue<std::pair<int, int>> q; // {number, operations}
        std::unordered_set<int> visited;
        q.push({n, 0});
        visited.insert(n);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [num, ops] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            if (num == 0) return ops;
            
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                int nextNum = num / 2;
                if (visited.find(nextNum) == visited.end()) {
                    q.push({nextNum, ops + 1});
                    visited.insert(nextNum);
                }
            }
            if (num > 0) {
                int nextNum = num - 1;
                if (visited.find(nextNum) == visited.end()) {
                    q.push({nextNum, ops + 1});
                    visited.insert(nextNum);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // Should not reach here
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of bits in the binary representation of $n$. This is because in the worst case, we might have to explore all possible combinations of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, as we need to store all the numbers we've visited in the queue and the set.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach explores all possible combinations of operations, leading to exponential time and space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the fact that the minimum number of operations to make a number zero is the same as the number of bits in its binary representation.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Convert the number to binary.
  2. Count the number of bits in the binary representation.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the number zero.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(log n)$, which is the best we can achieve because we need to at least read the input.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {
        return Integer.bitCount(n);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(log n)$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because we need to convert the number to binary, which takes logarithmic time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only need a constant amount of space to store the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the number zero, without exploring all possible combinations of operations.
