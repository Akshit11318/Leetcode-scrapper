## Minimum Time to Break Locks II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-break-locks-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A 2D array `locks` where each element is a lock with `time[i][0]` being the time it takes to break the lock and `time[i][1]` being the time it takes to repair the lock.
- Constraints: `1 <= locks.length <= 10^5`, `locks[i].length == 2`, `1 <= locks[i][0], locks[i][1] <= 10^9`.
- Expected output: The minimum time it takes to break all locks.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The locks are independent, and the order in which they are broken does not matter.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - For `locks = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]`, the minimum time to break all locks is `6` because we can break each lock in `1`, `2`, and `3` units of time respectively.
  - For `locks = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]`, the minimum time to break all locks is `6` because we can break each lock in `1`, `2`, and `3` units of time respectively.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the total time it takes to break all locks by summing up the time it takes to break each lock.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize a variable `totalTime` to store the total time.
  2. Iterate over each lock in the `locks` array.
  3. For each lock, add the time it takes to break the lock to `totalTime`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that directly calculates the total time.

```cpp
int minimumTimeToBreakLocks(vector<vector<int>>& locks) {
    long long totalTime = 0;
    for (auto& lock : locks) {
        totalTime += lock[0];
    }
    return totalTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of locks, because we are iterating over each lock once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are using a constant amount of space to store the total time.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are iterating over each lock, and the space complexity is constant because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem asks for the minimum time to break all locks, which is equivalent to finding the sum of the minimum time it takes to break each lock.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize a variable `totalTime` to store the total time.
  2. Iterate over each lock in the `locks` array.
  3. For each lock, add the time it takes to break the lock to `totalTime`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum time to break all locks.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity because we must iterate over each lock at least once.

```cpp
int minimumTimeToBreakLocks(vector<vector<int>>& locks) {
    long long totalTime = 0;
    for (auto& lock : locks) {
        totalTime += lock[0];
    }
    return totalTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of locks, because we are iterating over each lock once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are using a constant amount of space to store the total time.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because we must iterate over each lock at least once, and the space complexity is optimal because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, summation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct calculation.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the problem is already optimized.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve direct calculation, such as calculating the sum of an array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to initialize the `totalTime` variable, or using the wrong data type for the `totalTime` variable.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where the input array is empty, or the case where the input array contains locks with zero or negative time.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a data structure that scales with the input size, such as a vector or a map, to store the total time.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input arrays, including arrays with different lengths and arrays with different types of locks.
