## Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-flips-to-make-binary-grid-palindromic-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A binary grid `mat` of size `m x n`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- Expected output: The minimum number of flips to make the binary grid palindromic.
- Key requirements: A binary grid is palindromic if it is symmetric with respect to its center.
- Edge cases to consider: Empty grid, grid with a single row or column, grid with all zeros or all ones.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible flips for each cell in the grid and check if the resulting grid is palindromic.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate over all cells in the grid.
  2. For each cell, try flipping the cell and check if the resulting grid is palindromic.
  3. Keep track of the minimum number of flips required to make the grid palindromic.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible solutions.

```cpp
int minFlips(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
    int m = mat.size();
    int n = mat[0].size();
    int minFlips = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << (m * n)); mask++) {
        int flips = 0;
        vector<vector<int>> grid = mat;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << (i * n + j))) != 0) {
                    flips++;
                    grid[i][j] = 1 - grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        bool isPalindromic = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != grid[m - 1 - i][n - 1 - j]) {
                    isPalindromic = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!isPalindromic) break;
        }
        
        if (isPalindromic) {
            minFlips = min(minFlips, flips);
        }
    }
    
    return minFlips;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{m \cdot n} \cdot m \cdot n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible flips for each cell in the grid, resulting in exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we need to store the grid.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can use a greedy approach to flip the cells that are not palindromic.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Iterate over the cells in the grid from top to bottom and from left to right.
  2. For each cell, check if it is palindromic. If not, flip the cell.
  3. Keep track of the number of flips.
- Proof of optimality: The greedy approach is optimal because it always flips the cell that is not palindromic, resulting in the minimum number of flips.

```cpp
int minFlips(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
    int m = mat.size();
    int n = mat[0].size();
    int flips = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m / 2; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n / 2; j++) {
            if (mat[i][j] != mat[m - 1 - i][n - 1 - j]) {
                flips++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (m % 2 == 1) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n / 2; j++) {
            if (mat[m / 2][j] != mat[m / 2][n - 1 - j]) {
                flips++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (n % 2 == 1) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m / 2; i++) {
            if (mat[i][n / 2] != mat[m - 1 - i][n / 2]) {
                flips++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return flips;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the number of flips.
> - **Optimality proof:** The greedy approach is optimal because it always flips the cell that is not palindromic, resulting in the minimum number of flips.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy approach, iteration over the grid.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a greedy approach to solve the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a greedy approach to minimize the number of flips.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding the minimum number of operations to achieve a certain goal.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, not using a greedy approach.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty grid, grid with a single row or column, grid with all zeros or all ones.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach, not using a greedy approach.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
