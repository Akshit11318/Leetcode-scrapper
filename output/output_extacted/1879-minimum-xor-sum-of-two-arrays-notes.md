## Minimum XOR Sum of Two Arrays
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-xor-sum-of-two-arrays/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums1.length <= 12`, `1 <= nums2.length <= 12`, `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 3 * 10^3`.
- Expected output format: The minimum XOR sum of the two arrays.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - `nums1` and `nums2` must have the same length.
    - The minimum XOR sum is achieved by finding the optimal pairing between elements of `nums1` and `nums2`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - For `nums1 = [1,2]` and `nums2 = [1,2]`, the output should be `2` because the optimal pairing is `(1,1)` and `(2,2)` resulting in `1 XOR 1 + 2 XOR 2 = 0 + 0 = 0`, but since there's no pairing that results in a sum less than 2 without considering the actual XOR operation's impact, we should consider all possible pairings and their XOR sums.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the minimum XOR sum, we should consider all possible pairings between elements of `nums1` and `nums2`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Generate all permutations of `nums1` and `nums2`.
    2. For each pair of permutations, calculate the XOR sum by pairing corresponding elements from each permutation.
    3. Keep track of the minimum XOR sum found across all pairings.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It ensures that we consider every possible arrangement, guaranteeing that we'll find the minimum XOR sum if we have the computational resources to exhaust all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minimumXORSum(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    int n = nums1.size();
    int minSum = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all permutations of nums1
    do {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            sum += nums1[i] ^ nums2[i];
        }
        minSum = min(minSum, sum);
    } while (next_permutation(nums1.begin(), nums1.end()));
    
    return minSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums1` (or `nums2`), because we generate all permutations of `nums1`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input arrays, since we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum sum and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the permutation generation, which has a factorial complexity. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use bitmasking to represent subsets of `nums1` and `nums2`, then use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum XOR sum for each subset.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Initialize a DP array `dp` of size $2^n$, where $n$ is the length of `nums1`.
    2. For each state in `dp`, calculate the minimum XOR sum by considering all possible assignments of elements from `nums1` to elements in `nums2`.
    3. Update `dp` with the minimum XOR sum for each state.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that we consider all possible assignments of elements from `nums1` to elements in `nums2`, which is necessary for finding the minimum XOR sum.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minimumXORSum(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    int n = nums1.size();
    vector<int> dp(1 << n, INT_MAX);
    dp[0] = 0;
    
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!(mask & (1 << i))) {
                int nextMask = mask | (1 << i);
                dp[nextMask] = min(dp[nextMask], dp[mask] + (nums1[i] ^ nums2[__builtin_ctz(nextMask)]));
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot 2^n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums1`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, for the DP array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach considers all possible assignments of elements from `nums1` to elements in `nums2`, ensuring that we find the minimum XOR sum.
