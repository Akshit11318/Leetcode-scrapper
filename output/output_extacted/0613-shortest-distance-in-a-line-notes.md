## Shortest Distance in a Line
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-line/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A list of `Point` objects, where each `Point` object has `x` and `y` coordinates.
- Constraints: The list contains at least two points.
- Expected output format: The minimum distance between any two points in the list.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The distance between two points is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula. The minimum distance should be returned as a double value.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `[[1,1],[3,3],[5,5]]`, Output: `2.8284271247461903`. Explanation: The minimum distance is between points `(1,1)` and `(3,3)`.
  - Example 2: Input: `[[0,0],[3,4]]`, Output: `5.0`. Explanation: The minimum distance is between points `(0,0)` and `(3,4)`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the distance between each pair of points and keep track of the minimum distance found.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize the minimum distance to infinity.
  2. Iterate over each pair of points in the list.
  3. Calculate the Euclidean distance between the current pair of points.
  4. Update the minimum distance if the current distance is smaller.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive solution that checks all possible pairs of points.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double minDistance(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        double minDist = DBL_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < points.size(); j++) {
                double dist = sqrt(pow(points[i][0] - points[j][0], 2) + pow(points[i][1] - points[j][1], 2));
                minDist = min(minDist, dist);
            }
        }
        return minDist;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of points. This is because we are iterating over each pair of points.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the minimum distance.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is quadratic because we are using two nested loops to iterate over all pairs of points. The space complexity is constant because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal in terms of time complexity, as we must check all pairs of points to find the minimum distance. However, we can optimize the implementation by using a more efficient method to calculate the Euclidean distance.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the minimum distance to infinity.
  2. Iterate over each pair of points in the list.
  3. Calculate the squared Euclidean distance between the current pair of points.
  4. Update the minimum distance if the current distance is smaller.
- Proof of optimality: We must check all pairs of points to find the minimum distance, so the time complexity is inherently quadratic.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double minDistance(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        double minDist = DBL_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < points.size(); j++) {
                double dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0];
                double dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1];
                double dist = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
                minDist = min(minDist, dist);
            }
        }
        return minDist;
    }
};
```
