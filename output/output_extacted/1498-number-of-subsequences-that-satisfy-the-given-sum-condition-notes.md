## Number of Subsequences that Satisfy the Given Sum Condition

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subsequences-that-satisfy-the-given-sum-condition/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an array `nums` and an integer `target`, return the number of subsequences of `nums` that sum to `target`.
- Input format: `nums` is a non-empty array of integers, and `target` is an integer.
- Expected output format: The number of subsequences of `nums` that sum to `target`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The array `nums` can have duplicate elements.
  - The `target` can be negative, zero, or positive.
  - The number of subsequences can be very large.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `nums = [3, 5, 6, 7], target = 9` should return `4`, because the subsequences that sum to `9` are `[3, 6], [3, 7 - 1], [5, 4], [7, 2]`.
  - `nums = [3, 3, 6, 8], target = 10` should return `6`, because the subsequences that sum to `10` are `[3, 3, 4], [3, 7], [3, 6, 1], [6, 4], [8, 2], [3, 3, 3, 1]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can generate all possible subsequences of `nums` and check if their sum equals `target`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsequences of `nums`.
  2. For each subsequence, calculate its sum.
  3. If the sum equals `target`, increment the count of subsequences.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that checks all possibilities.

```cpp
int numSubseq(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int count = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    // Generate all possible subsequences
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                sum += nums[i];
            }
        }
        // Check if the sum equals target
        if (sum == target) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we generate $2^n$ subsequences and calculate the sum of each subsequence in $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the count of subsequences and the current subsequence.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks all possible subsequences, resulting in exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the subsequences that sum to `target`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the array `nums` in ascending order.
  2. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of `nums`, respectively.
  3. Use a `while` loop to move the pointers towards each other, checking if the sum of the elements at the current positions equals `target`.
  4. If the sum equals `target`, increment the count of subsequences and move both pointers.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting step, and $O(n)$ for the two-pointer technique, resulting in an overall time complexity of $O(n \log n)$.

```cpp
int numSubseq(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int count = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        if (nums[left] + nums[right] == target) {
            count++;
            left++;
            right--;
        } else if (nums[left] + nums[right] < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the subsequences that sum to `target`, resulting in a significant reduction in time complexity compared to the brute force approach.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Two-pointer technique, sorting, and efficient searching.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a two-pointer technique to find pairs of elements that satisfy a condition.
- Optimization techniques learned: Sorting the array to enable efficient searching using a two-pointer technique.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly implementing the two-pointer technique, failing to handle edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty array, array with duplicate elements, target value that is not present in the array.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that results in exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with large inputs, testing the solution with edge cases.
