## Maximum Population Year

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-population-year/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A list of integers `logs` where each integer represents a person's birth year and death year in the format `[birth_year, death_year]`.
- Constraints: `1 <= logs.length <= 100`, `1950 <= birth_year <= death_year <= 2050`.
- Expected Output: The year with the maximum population.
- Key Requirements: Find the year with the maximum population based on the given birth and death years.
- Edge Cases: Consider the scenario where there are multiple years with the same maximum population.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Create a list of all years from the minimum birth year to the maximum death year. Then, iterate over each year and calculate the population by counting the number of people alive in that year.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Find the minimum birth year and the maximum death year.
  2. Create a list of all years from the minimum birth year to the maximum death year.
  3. Initialize a variable to store the maximum population and the corresponding year.
  4. Iterate over each year in the list and calculate the population by counting the number of people alive in that year.
  5. Update the maximum population and the corresponding year if the current year has a higher population.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it may not be the most efficient solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumPopulation(vector<vector<int>>& logs) {
        int minYear = INT_MAX;
        int maxYear = INT_MIN;
        
        // Find the minimum birth year and the maximum death year
        for (auto& log : logs) {
            minYear = min(minYear, log[0]);
            maxYear = max(maxYear, log[1]);
        }
        
        int maxPopulation = 0;
        int maxPopulationYear = 0;
        
        // Iterate over each year and calculate the population
        for (int year = minYear; year <= maxYear; year++) {
            int population = 0;
            for (auto& log : logs) {
                if (log[0] <= year && year <= log[1]) {
                    population++;
                }
            }
            if (population > maxPopulation) {
                maxPopulation = population;
                maxPopulationYear = year;
            }
        }
        
        return maxPopulationYear;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times m)$, where $n$ is the number of logs and $m$ is the number of years between the minimum birth year and the maximum death year. This is because we are iterating over each log for each year.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the minimum birth year, the maximum death year, the maximum population, and the corresponding year.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are iterating over each log for each year, and the space complexity is low because we are using a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of iterating over each year and calculating the population, we can use a more efficient approach by counting the number of people alive at each year.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Create a map to store the count of people alive at each year.
  2. Iterate over each log and update the count of people alive at each year.
  3. Find the year with the maximum count of people alive.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the minimum time complexity required to solve this problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumPopulation(vector<vector<int>>& logs) {
        map<int, int> count;
        
        // Update the count of people alive at each year
        for (auto& log : logs) {
            for (int year = log[0]; year <= log[1]; year++) {
                count[year]++;
            }
        }
        
        int maxPopulation = 0;
        int maxPopulationYear = 0;
        
        // Find the year with the maximum count of people alive
        for (auto& it : count) {
            if (it.second > maxPopulation) {
                maxPopulation = it.second;
                maxPopulationYear = it.first;
            }
        }
        
        return maxPopulationYear;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Counting, iteration, and optimization.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing variables, not checking for edge cases, and not optimizing the solution.
- Edge cases to watch for: Multiple years with the same maximum population, empty input, and invalid input.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach, not optimizing the solution, and not using the right data structures.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different inputs, testing with edge cases, and testing with large inputs.
