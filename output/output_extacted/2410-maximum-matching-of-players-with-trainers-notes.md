## Maximum Matching of Players with Trainers

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two arrays, `players` and `trainers`, where `players[i]` and `trainers[j]` represent the skills of the i-th player and the j-th trainer, respectively.
- Constraints: Both arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
- Expected output: The maximum number of players that can be matched with a trainer.
- Key requirements: A player can be matched with a trainer if the player's skill is less than or equal to the trainer's skill.
- Example test cases:
  - `players = [4,7,8], trainers = [8,2,5,8]`, Expected output: `2`
  - `players = [1,2,3], trainers = [4,5,1]`, Expected output: `1`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of players and trainers to find the maximum number of matches.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Sort both arrays in ascending order.
  2. Initialize a variable to store the maximum number of matches.
  3. Iterate over all possible combinations of players and trainers.
  4. For each combination, check if the player's skill is less than or equal to the trainer's skill. If it is, increment the match count.
  5. Update the maximum number of matches if the current combination has more matches.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to solve the problem by trying all possible combinations.

```cpp
int matchPlayersAndTrainers(vector<int>& players, vector<int>& trainers) {
    int n = players.size();
    int maxMatches = 0;
    sort(players.begin(), players.end());
    sort(trainers.begin(), trainers.end());
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < n && j < n) {
        if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
            i++;
            j++;
            maxMatches++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }
    return maxMatches;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting of both arrays, where $n$ is the number of players/trainers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum number of matches.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The sorting operation dominates the time complexity, and the space complexity is constant because we don't use any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can use a two-pointer technique to find the maximum number of matches in a single pass after sorting both arrays.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Sort both arrays in ascending order.
  2. Initialize two pointers, one for each array, to the beginning of each array.
  3. Iterate over the arrays using the two-pointer technique. If the current player's skill is less than or equal to the current trainer's skill, increment the match count and move both pointers forward. Otherwise, move the trainer pointer forward.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting, and a space complexity of $O(1)$, which is optimal for this problem.

```cpp
int matchPlayersAndTrainers(vector<int>& players, vector<int>& trainers) {
    int n = players.size();
    int maxMatches = 0;
    sort(players.begin(), players.end());
    sort(trainers.begin(), trainers.end());
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < n && j < n) {
        if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
            i++;
            j++;
            maxMatches++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }
    return maxMatches;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum number of matches.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a two-pointer technique to find the maximum number of matches in a single pass after sorting both arrays, resulting in the best possible time and space complexities for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts: Sorting, two-pointer technique.
- Problem-solving patterns: Using sorting and two pointers to find the maximum number of matches.
- Optimization techniques: Reducing the time complexity by using a two-pointer technique instead of trying all possible combinations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving sorting and two-pointer techniques.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not sorting the arrays before using the two-pointer technique.
- Not initializing the pointers correctly.
- Not handling the edge cases where one array is empty or the other array has a larger size.
- Not testing the code thoroughly to ensure it works for all possible inputs.
