## Check if DFS Strings are Palindromes

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-dfs-strings-are-palindromes/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a binary tree, return `true` if all the DFS strings are palindromes, otherwise return `false`. 
- The DFS string of a binary tree is a sequence of values of nodes in the tree from left to right, using the pre-order traversal (root, left, right).
- Input: A binary tree, where each node is represented by a unique integer.
- Expected output: A boolean value indicating whether all DFS strings are palindromes.
- Key requirements: The input tree can be empty, and the values in the tree are unique integers.
- Example test cases:
  - For the binary tree `root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,4,4]`, the DFS strings are `2111344` and `2111434`, which are not both palindromes, so the function should return `false`.
  - For an empty tree, the function should return `true`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to generate all possible DFS strings by exploring all possible traversals of the binary tree.
- Then, for each DFS string, we check if it is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end, moving towards the center.
- This approach is straightforward but inefficient because it involves generating all possible DFS strings and checking each one for being a palindrome.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindromes(string s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] != s[right]) return false;
            left++, right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    vector<string> getDFSStrings(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return {""};
        vector<string> result;
        string current = to_string(root->val);
        if (!root->left && !root->right) {
            result.push_back(current);
        } else {
            vector<string> leftStrings = getDFSStrings(root->left);
            vector<string> rightStrings = getDFSStrings(root->right);
            for (string left : leftStrings) {
                for (string right : rightStrings) {
                    result.push_back(current + left + right);
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    bool isAllDFSStringsPalindromes(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<string> dfsStrings = getDFSStrings(root);
        for (string s : dfsStrings) {
            if (!isPalindromes(s)) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree. The $2^n$ factor comes from generating all possible DFS strings, and the $n$ factor comes from checking each string for being a palindrome.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, for storing all possible DFS strings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates all possible DFS strings, which leads to exponential time and space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Instead of generating all possible DFS strings and checking each one, we can use a more efficient approach by directly checking if the DFS traversal of the tree is a palindrome without explicitly generating all strings.
- We can achieve this by using two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the DFS traversal and one from the end, and compare the values at these positions.
- If we find a mismatch, we can immediately return `false`.
- This approach avoids the exponential complexity of generating all possible DFS strings.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return true;
        vector<int> dfsTraversal;
        getDFS(root, dfsTraversal);
        int left = 0, right = dfsTraversal.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (dfsTraversal[left] != dfsTraversal[right]) return false;
            left++, right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    void getDFS(TreeNode* node, vector<int>& traversal) {
        if (!node) return;
        traversal.push_back(node->val);
        getDFS(node->left, traversal);
        getDFS(node->right, traversal);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree. We only need to traverse the tree once to get the DFS traversal.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the DFS traversal.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single traversal of the tree, which is the minimum number of operations needed to check if the DFS strings are palindromes.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: DFS traversal, palindrome checking, and optimization techniques.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: avoiding exponential complexity by directly checking for palindromes without generating all possible strings.
- Optimization techniques learned: using two pointers to compare values from the start and end of the DFS traversal.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not handling the case where the tree is empty, and not correctly implementing the DFS traversal.
- Edge cases to watch for: trees with a single node, and trees with multiple nodes but no left or right child.
- Performance pitfalls: generating all possible DFS strings, which leads to exponential complexity.
- Testing considerations: testing the function with different types of trees, including empty trees, trees with a single node, and trees with multiple nodes.
