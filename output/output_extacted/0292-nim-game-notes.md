## Nim Game
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: The input is an integer `n`, representing the number of stones in the pile.
- Constraints: $1 \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1$.
- Expected output format: A boolean value indicating whether the current player will win.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The problem involves a game where two players take turns removing 1, 2, or 3 stones from a pile. The last player to remove a stone wins.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `n = 4`, Output: `false` because if the first player removes 1 stone, the second player can always win by mirroring the first player's moves.
  - Input: `n = 5`, Output: `true` because the first player can win by removing 1 stone and then forcing the second player into a losing position.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves simulating all possible games and determining the outcome of each one.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a recursive function that simulates the game.
  2. In each recursive call, try removing 1, 2, or 3 stones and recursively call the function with the updated number of stones.
  3. If the recursive call returns a win for the current player, return a loss for the other player.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to solve the problem, but it's not efficient due to the large number of possible games.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canWinNim(int n) {
        if (n <= 3) {
            return true;
        }
        bool canWin = false;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            if (!canWinNim(n - i)) {
                canWin = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        return canWin;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(3^n)$, where $n$ is the number of stones. This is because in the worst case, we have to simulate all possible games.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of stones. This is because of the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves simulating all possible games, which leads to an exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the recursive call stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is that the game is periodic with a period of 4. This means that if the number of stones is a multiple of 4, the current player will lose.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. If the number of stones is a multiple of 4, return `false`.
  2. Otherwise, return `true`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it takes into account the periodic nature of the game and directly returns the result without simulating all possible games.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a constant time complexity, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the number of stones. This is because the solution only involves a constant-time operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the number of stones. This is because the solution does not use any extra space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it takes into account the periodic nature of the game and directly returns the result without simulating all possible games.
