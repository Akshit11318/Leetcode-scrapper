## Tiling a Rectangle with the Fewest Squares

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/tiling-a-rectangle-with-the-fewest-squares/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `n` (integer, the width of the rectangle), `m` (integer, the height of the rectangle)
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 13`, `1 <= m <= 13`
- Output: The fewest number of squares that can tile the rectangle without overlapping.
- Key requirements: Find the minimum number of squares needed to cover the entire rectangle.
- Edge cases: When `n` or `m` is 1, the rectangle can be tiled with a single square of size `m` or `n`, respectively.

Example test cases:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 3`
  Output: `3` (Explanation: We need at least three squares of size 1x1 to cover a 2x3 rectangle)
- Input: `n = 5`, `m = 4`
  Output: `4` (Explanation: We need at least four squares of size 1x1 to cover a 5x4 rectangle, but we can actually use a square of size 4x4 and a square of size 1x1)

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of squares that can fit into the rectangle.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start with the largest possible square size that can fit into the rectangle.
  2. Try to place the square in all possible positions within the rectangle.
  3. If a square can be placed, mark the area covered by the square as filled.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the entire rectangle is filled or no more squares can be placed.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, intuitive approach that tries to use the largest possible squares first.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int tilingRectangle(int n, int m) {
    // Initialize the rectangle as a 2D vector
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> rectangle(n, std::vector<int>(m, 0));
    
    int count = 0;
    while (true) {
        // Find the largest possible square size that can fit into the rectangle
        int maxSize = std::min(n, m);
        for (int size = maxSize; size >= 1; size--) {
            // Try to place the square in all possible positions within the rectangle
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - size; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= m - size; j++) {
                    // Check if the square can be placed at the current position
                    bool canPlace = true;
                    for (int x = i; x < i + size; x++) {
                        for (int y = j; y < j + size; y++) {
                            if (rectangle[x][y] == 1) {
                                canPlace = false;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                        if (!canPlace) break;
                    }
                    if (canPlace) {
                        // Mark the area covered by the square as filled
                        for (int x = i; x < i + size; x++) {
                            for (int y = j; y < j + size; y++) {
                                rectangle[x][y] = 1;
                            }
                        }
                        count++;
                        goto nextIteration;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // If no more squares can be placed, break the loop
        break;
        
        nextIteration:;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot m^2)$ (Explanation: In the worst case, we need to try all possible positions for all possible square sizes)
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ (Explanation: We need to store the rectangle as a 2D vector)
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations of squares, resulting in a high time complexity. The space complexity is due to the need to store the rectangle as a 2D vector.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a queue with the initial state of the rectangle.
  2. For each state in the queue, try to place all possible squares.
  3. For each possible square placement, create a new state and add it to the queue.
  4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the queue is empty or a state with a fully filled rectangle is found.
- Proof of optimality: The BFS algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path to the goal state (i.e., the state with the fewest number of squares).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

struct State {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> rectangle;
    int count;
};

int tilingRectangle(int n, int m) {
    std::queue<State> queue;
    State initialState;
    initialState.rectangle = std::vector<std::vector<int>>(n, std::vector<int>(m, 0));
    initialState.count = 0;
    queue.push(initialState);
    
    int minCount = INT_MAX;
    while (!queue.empty()) {
        State currentState = queue.front();
        queue.pop();
        
        // Check if the current state has a fully filled rectangle
        bool isFilled = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (currentState.rectangle[i][j] == 0) {
                    isFilled = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!isFilled) break;
        }
        if (isFilled) {
            minCount = std::min(minCount, currentState.count);
        }
        
        // Try to place all possible squares
        for (int size = std::min(n, m); size >= 1; size--) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - size; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= m - size; j++) {
                    // Check if the square can be placed at the current position
                    bool canPlace = true;
                    for (int x = i; x < i + size; x++) {
                        for (int y = j; y < j + size; y++) {
                            if (currentState.rectangle[x][y] == 1) {
                                canPlace = false;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                        if (!canPlace) break;
                    }
                    if (canPlace) {
                        // Create a new state and add it to the queue
                        State newState = currentState;
                        for (int x = i; x < i + size; x++) {
                            for (int y = j; y < j + size; y++) {
                                newState.rectangle[x][y] = 1;
                            }
                        }
                        newState.count++;
                        queue.push(newState);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return minCount;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: BFS algorithm, state management.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a queue to manage states, trying all possible square placements.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal state.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding the minimum number of objects to cover a certain area.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking if a square can be placed at a certain position, not updating the state correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: When the rectangle is fully filled, when no more squares can be placed.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach, not using a BFS algorithm.
- Testing considerations: Test the algorithm with different input sizes, test the algorithm with different square sizes.
