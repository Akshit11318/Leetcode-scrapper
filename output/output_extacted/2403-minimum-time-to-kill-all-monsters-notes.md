## Minimum Time to Kill All Monsters
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-kill-all-monsters/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array `health` representing the health of each monster and an array `maxHit` representing the maximum hit a player can deal to a monster.
- Constraints: The health and maxHit arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
- Expected output format: The minimum time required to kill all monsters.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The player can deal any amount of damage between 1 and `maxHit[i]` to the `i-th` monster. The goal is to find the minimum time required to kill all monsters.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `health = [1,2,3], maxHit = [1,2,3]`: The minimum time is 3.
  - `health = [1,1,1], maxHit = [1,1,1]`: The minimum time is 1.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of hits for each monster and find the minimum time required to kill all monsters.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of hits for each monster.
  2. For each combination, calculate the time required to kill all monsters.
  3. Find the minimum time among all combinations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int minimumTime(vector<int>& health, vector<int>& maxHit) {
    int n = health.size();
    int result = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all possible combinations of hits
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        vector<int> hits(n);
        int time = 0;
        
        // Calculate the time required for the current combination
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask >> i) & 1) {
                hits[i] = maxHit[i];
            } else {
                hits[i] = 1;
            }
            time = max(time, (health[i] + hits[i] - 1) / hits[i]);
        }
        
        // Update the result
        result = min(result, time);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of monsters. This is because we generate all possible combinations of hits and calculate the time required for each combination.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of monsters. This is because we need to store the hits for each monster.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we try all possible combinations of hits, and the space complexity occurs because we need to store the hits for each monster.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The minimum time required to kill all monsters is the maximum of the times required to kill each monster.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the time required to kill each monster using binary search.
  2. Find the maximum of the times required to kill each monster.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it finds the minimum time required to kill all monsters by finding the maximum of the times required to kill each monster.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n \log m)$, where $n$ is the number of monsters and $m$ is the maximum health of a monster. This is the best possible time complexity because we need to calculate the time required to kill each monster.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int minimumTime(vector<int>& health, vector<int>& maxHit) {
    int n = health.size();
    int result = 0;
    
    // Calculate the time required to kill each monster
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int low = 1, high = health[i];
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (mid * maxHit[i] < health[i]) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        result = max(result, low);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log m)$, where $n$ is the number of monsters and $m$ is the maximum health of a monster. This is because we use binary search to calculate the time required to kill each monster.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it finds the minimum time required to kill all monsters by finding the maximum of the times required to kill each monster.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Binary search, time complexity analysis.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Finding the minimum time required to kill all monsters by finding the maximum of the times required to kill each monster.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using binary search to calculate the time required to kill each monster.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding the minimum time required to complete a task.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not using binary search to calculate the time required to kill each monster.
- Edge cases to watch for: Monsters with zero health, monsters with maximum health equal to the maximum hit.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach to try all possible combinations of hits.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
