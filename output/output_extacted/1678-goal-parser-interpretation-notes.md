## Goal Parser Interpretation

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/goal-parser-interpretation/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input string `command` contains only the characters `G`, `()`, and `(` `i` `)`, where `G` represents a goal, `()` represents a right parenthesis, and `(` `i` `)` represents a left parenthesis with the string `i`.
- Expected output format: Return the interpreted string after parsing the given `command`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle each character in the command string, recognizing the meaning of `G`, `()`, and `(` `i` `)`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given the command `"G()(al)"`, the output should be `"Gal"`, where `G` is a goal, `()` is an empty string, and `(` `i` `)` is replaced with the string `al`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over the command string and interpret each character or sequence of characters based on its meaning.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the interpreted command.
  2. Iterate over each character in the command string.
  3. If the character is `G`, append it to `result`.
  4. If the character is `(`, check the next character. If it's `)`, append an empty string to `result`. If it's `i`, read the next characters until `)` and append the string between `(` and `)` to `result`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the problem statement, processing each character based on its defined interpretation.

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string interpret(string command) {
    string result = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < command.length(); i++) {
        if (command[i] == 'G') {
            result += 'G';
        } else if (command[i] == '(') {
            if (command[i + 1] == ')') {
                result += "";
                i++;
            } else {
                result += command.substr(i + 2, command.find(')', i) - i - 2);
                i = command.find(')', i);
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the command string, since we potentially iterate over the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as in the worst case, the length of the result string could be the same as the input command string.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The iteration over the command string and the construction of the result string contribute to these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved by iterating over the command string and using a simple state machine or direct string manipulation to interpret the commands.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same as the brute force approach, as it already represents an efficient way to solve the problem given the need to examine each character in the command string.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the input string and does not involve any unnecessary operations that would increase the time complexity beyond $O(n)$.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Given that every character in the input must be examined at least once to determine the output, any algorithm must have at least a time complexity of $O(n)$, making the current approach optimal.

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string interpret(string command) {
    string result = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < command.length(); i++) {
        if (command[i] == 'G') {
            result += 'G';
        } else if (command[i] == '(') {
            if (command[i + 1] == ')') {
                result += "";
                i++;
            } else {
                result += command.substr(i + 2, command.find(')', i) - i - 2);
                i = command.find(')', i);
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the command string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for the result string.
> - **Optimality proof:** The algorithm's time complexity is linear with respect to the input size, which is the minimum required to process each character in the command string at least once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: String manipulation and iteration.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct interpretation of input based on predefined rules.
- Optimization techniques learned: Ensuring that each operation is necessary and contributes to the solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation problems, such as parsing expressions or decoding messages.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect handling of edge cases, such as an empty input string or a string with unbalanced parentheses.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the end of the string correctly when encountering a `(` without a corresponding `)`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient string concatenation methods in languages where it leads to high overhead due to string immutability.
- Testing considerations: Ensure that the solution works correctly for various inputs, including those with repeated `G`, `()`, and `(` `i` `)` sequences.
