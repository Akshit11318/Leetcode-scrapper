## Apply Operations to Make String Empty
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-make-string-empty/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- Expected Output: The minimum number of operations required to make the string empty.
- Key Requirements: 
    - An operation is defined as either deleting the string `s` entirely or deleting the first half of `s`.
    - The goal is to find the minimum number of operations to empty the string.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves trying all possible combinations of operations to empty the string.
- We can use a recursive approach, where at each step, we either delete the entire string or delete the first half of it.
- However, this approach quickly becomes impractical due to the exponential number of possible combinations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        
        function<void(string, int)> dfs = [&](string s, int op) {
            if (s.empty()) {
                ans = min(ans, op);
                return;
            }
            if (s.length() == 1) {
                dfs("", op + 1);
                return;
            }
            dfs("", op + 1);
            dfs(s.substr(s.length() / 2), op + 1);
        };
        
        dfs(s, 0);
        return ans;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because in the worst case, we might have to explore all possible combinations of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, due to the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The exponential time complexity is due to the recursive nature of the brute force approach, where we explore all possible combinations of operations. The space complexity is due to the recursive call stack, which can grow up to the length of the string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight here is to realize that the optimal strategy involves always deleting the first half of the string, unless the string has a length of 1, in which case we delete the entire string.
- This is because deleting the first half of the string reduces the length of the string by the largest amount possible, thus minimizing the number of operations required.
- We can use a simple iterative approach to calculate the minimum number of operations required.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int op = 0;
        
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n == 1) {
                op++;
                n = 0;
            } else {
                op++;
                n /= 2;
            }
        }
        
        return op;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we divide the length of the string by 2 at each step, until the string is empty.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the length of the string and the number of operations.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it always chooses the operation that reduces the length of the string by the largest amount possible, thus minimizing the number of operations required.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: greedy algorithms, iterative approaches.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: always choose the operation that reduces the length of the string by the largest amount possible.
- Optimization techniques learned: using iterative approaches instead of recursive ones, avoiding unnecessary computations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: using recursive approaches when iterative ones are more efficient.
- Edge cases to watch for: strings of length 1, which require special handling.
- Performance pitfalls: using exponential time complexity algorithms when logarithmic time complexity ones are available.
- Testing considerations: testing the algorithm with strings of different lengths, including edge cases.
