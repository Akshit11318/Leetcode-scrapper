## Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-sub-folders-from-the-filesystem/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A list of strings `folder` representing the paths of folders in the filesystem.
- Constraints: The length of `folder` is between 1 and 10, and each string consists of lowercase letters, digits, and forward slashes.
- Expected output format: A list of strings representing the paths of the remaining folders after removing sub-folders.
- Key requirements: Remove any folder that is a sub-folder of another folder in the list.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/f/g/h","/f/g/h/i"]`
  - Output: `["/a","/c/d","/f/g/h"]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Compare each folder with every other folder to check if it is a sub-folder.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Sort the list of folders.
  2. Iterate over the list and for each folder, compare it with the remaining folders to check if it is a sub-folder.
  3. If a folder is found to be a sub-folder, mark it for removal.
  4. Finally, return the list of folders that are not marked for removal.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeSubfolders(vector<string>& folder) {
        // Sort the list of folders
        sort(folder.begin(), folder.end());
        
        vector<string> result;
        for (const string& f : folder) {
            // Check if the current folder is a sub-folder of any folder in the result
            bool isSubfolder = false;
            for (const string& r : result) {
                if (f.length() > r.length() && f[r.length()] == '/' && f.substr(0, r.length()) == r) {
                    isSubfolder = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!isSubfolder) {
                result.push_back(f);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of folders and $m$ is the maximum length of a folder path. This is because for each folder, we are comparing it with all the folders in the result.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of folders. This is because we are storing the result in a separate vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity because it involves comparing each folder with every other folder. The space complexity is linear because we are storing the result in a separate vector.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can sort the list of folders and then iterate over the list to check if each folder is a sub-folder of the previous folder.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the list of folders.
  2. Initialize an empty result vector.
  3. Iterate over the sorted list of folders. For each folder, check if it is a sub-folder of the last folder in the result.
  4. If the current folder is not a sub-folder, add it to the result.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeSubfolders(vector<string>& folder) {
        // Sort the list of folders
        sort(folder.begin(), folder.end());
        
        vector<string> result;
        for (const string& f : folder) {
            // If the result is empty or the current folder is not a sub-folder of the last folder in the result
            if (result.empty() || f.find(result.back() + '/') != 0) {
                result.push_back(f);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of folders and $m$ is the maximum length of a folder path. This is because we are sorting the list of folders and then iterating over the list.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of folders. This is because we are storing the result in a separate vector.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are only comparing each folder with the last folder in the result, which reduces the number of comparisons required.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting and iterating over a list to check for sub-folders.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a result vector to store the folders that are not sub-folders.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the number of comparisons required by sorting the list of folders and iterating over the list.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems involving sorting and iterating over a list to check for certain conditions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking if the result vector is empty before accessing its last element.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input list, folders with the same path but different cases.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that involves comparing each folder with every other folder.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input lists, including empty lists and lists with duplicate folders.
