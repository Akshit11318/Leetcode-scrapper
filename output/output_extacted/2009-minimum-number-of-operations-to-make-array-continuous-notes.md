## Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-continuous/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`, and `1 <= k <= 10^9`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations required to make the array continuous.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling duplicate elements, ensuring the array is continuous, and optimizing the solution for large inputs.
- Example test cases:
  - `nums = [4, 2, 5, 3], k = 5`, output: `1` (remove `5` to make the array continuous).
  - `nums = [1, 10, 3, 7, 4, 2], k = 9`, output: `3` (remove `10`, `7`, and `9` to make the array continuous).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through all possible subsets of the array and check if removing the elements in the subset makes the array continuous.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of the array.
  2. For each subset, remove the elements in the subset from the array.
  3. Check if the resulting array is continuous.
  4. If the array is continuous, calculate the number of operations required to remove the elements in the subset.
  5. Keep track of the minimum number of operations required across all subsets.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int minOps = n;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        std::vector<int> arr;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!(mask & (1 << i))) {
                arr.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        if (isContinuous(arr)) {
            int ops = __builtin_popcount(mask);
            minOps = std::min(minOps, ops);
        }
    }
    return minOps;
}

bool isContinuous(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] > k) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \cdot \log n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. The $2^n$ factor comes from generating all possible subsets, and the $n \cdot \log n$ factor comes from sorting the array for each subset.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we need to store the subset of elements to remove.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity due to generating all possible subsets and sorting the array for each subset.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of generating all possible subsets, we can use a sliding window approach to find the longest continuous subarray.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the input array.
  2. Initialize a sliding window with two pointers, `left` and `right`.
  3. Move the `right` pointer to the right and update the window size if the difference between the elements at `right` and `left` is within the limit `k`.
  4. Move the `left` pointer to the right if the difference between the elements at `right` and `left` exceeds the limit `k`.
  5. Keep track of the maximum window size and the minimum number of operations required.

```cpp
int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxLen = 0;
    int left = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        if (right > 0 && nums[right] - nums[right - 1] > k) {
            left = right;
        }
        maxLen = std::max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return n - maxLen;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \log n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. The $\log n$ factor comes from sorting the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space required for the input and output.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach has a lower time complexity than the brute force approach because it avoids generating all possible subsets and uses a sliding window approach to find the longest continuous subarray.
