## Product Sales Analysis III
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/product-sales-analysis-iii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves analyzing sales data for a set of products. Given two tables: `Sales` and `Product`, find the product_id and product_name for products that have at least 100 units sold in the first quarter of 2019.
- Expected output format: The output should be a table with `product_id` and `product_name` columns, sorted by `product_id`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The sales data is aggregated by product and date, and the first quarter of 2019 includes January, February, and March.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if the sales data shows that product A had 50 units sold in January, 30 units sold in February, and 20 units sold in March, the total units sold for product A in the first quarter would be 100, and it should be included in the output.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to iterate over each product and calculate the total units sold in the first quarter of 2019. This involves joining the `Sales` and `Product` tables on the `product_id` column, filtering the data to only include sales in the first quarter of 2019, and then grouping the data by `product_id` and `product_name`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Join the `Sales` and `Product` tables on the `product_id` column.
  2. Filter the data to only include sales in the first quarter of 2019 (January, February, and March).
  3. Group the data by `product_id` and `product_name`.
  4. Calculate the total units sold for each product in the first quarter.
  5. Filter the results to only include products with at least 100 units sold.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and involves basic data manipulation and filtering.

```cpp
// Assuming the use of SQL for this problem
SELECT 
    p.product_id, 
    p.product_name
FROM 
    Sales s
JOIN 
    Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE 
    s.sale_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'
GROUP BY 
    p.product_id, 
    p.product_name
HAVING 
    SUM(s.quantity) >= 100
ORDER BY 
    p.product_id;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Sales` table, due to the sorting required for the join and grouping operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Sales` table, for storing the intermediate results of the join and grouping operations.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the sorting required for the join and grouping operations, while the space complexity is due to the need to store the intermediate results of these operations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using the same basic approach as the brute force solution but optimizing the SQL query to minimize the amount of data being processed.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use an efficient join algorithm, such as a hash join or merge join, to join the `Sales` and `Product` tables.
  2. Use an index on the `sale_date` column to efficiently filter the data to only include sales in the first quarter of 2019.
  3. Use an index on the `product_id` column to efficiently group the data by `product_id` and `product_name`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the amount of data being processed by using efficient join and filtering algorithms, and it uses indexes to optimize the grouping and sorting operations.

```cpp
// Assuming the use of SQL for this problem
SELECT 
    p.product_id, 
    p.product_name
FROM 
    Sales s
JOIN 
    Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE 
    s.sale_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'
GROUP BY 
    p.product_id, 
    p.product_name
HAVING 
    SUM(s.quantity) >= 100
ORDER BY 
    p.product_id;
```
