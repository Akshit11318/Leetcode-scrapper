## Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-kth-largest-integer-in-the-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of strings `nums` where each string represents an integer, and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq k \leq nums.length \leq 10^4$, $1 \leq nums[i].length \leq 9$.
- Expected output format: The Kth largest integer in the array.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling strings of varying lengths.
  - Comparing numbers as strings, which might not yield the correct result if they are of different lengths.
  - Handling `k` being within the bounds of the array length.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = ["3","6","7","10"]` and `k = 4`, the output should be `"3"`.
  - For `nums = ["2","21","12","1"]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `"2"`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Convert each string to an integer and store them in an array. Then, sort this array in descending order and select the Kth element.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Convert each string in `nums` to an integer.
  2. Store these integers in a new array.
  3. Sort the new array in descending order.
  4. Return the Kth element of the sorted array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by converting strings to integers and then sorting them.

```cpp
vector<int> stringToInt(vector<string>& nums) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (const auto& num : nums) {
        result.push_back(stoi(num));
    }
    return result;
}

string kthLargestNumber(vector<string>& nums, int k) {
    vector<int> ints = stringToInt(nums);
    sort(ints.begin(), ints.end(), greater<int>());
    return to_string(ints[k-1]);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. This is due to the sorting operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we create a new array to store the integers.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The sorting operation dominates the time complexity, and creating a new array for integers contributes to the space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of converting all strings to integers and then sorting, we can sort the strings directly based on their numerical value. This can be achieved by using a custom comparator in the sorting algorithm.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Define a custom comparator that compares two strings as if they were numbers.
  2. Sort the `nums` array using this custom comparator in descending order.
  3. Return the Kth element of the sorted array.
- Proof of optimality: This approach still requires sorting, which has a lower bound of $O(n \log n)$ in the comparison model for general inputs. However, it avoids the overhead of converting strings to integers.

```cpp
bool compare(const string& a, const string& b) {
    if (a.length() != b.length()) {
        return a.length() > b.length();
    }
    return a > b;
}

string kthLargestNumber(vector<string>& nums, int k) {
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [](const string& a, const string& b) {
        if (a.length() != b.length()) {
            return a.length() > b.length();
        }
        return a > b;
    });
    return nums[k-1];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, due to the sorting operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ if we consider the sorting to be in-place, or $O(n)$ if the sorting algorithm used creates additional space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal for comparison-based sorting. The space complexity can vary depending on the sorting algorithm used.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Custom comparators, sorting algorithms.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Avoiding unnecessary type conversions, using custom comparators for complex sorting.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing unnecessary operations (like string to integer conversions), using in-place sorting.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving custom sorting or comparisons.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect comparator logic, off-by-one errors when accessing the Kth element.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling `k` being out of bounds, ensuring the sorting algorithm handles equal-length strings correctly.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient sorting algorithms or unnecessary type conversions.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with different input sizes, `k` values, and edge cases.
