## Find the Power of K-Size Subarrays I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-power-of-k-size-subarrays-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`, `1 <= k <= nums.length`.
- Expected output format: The `k`-th power of the sum of all `k`-size subarrays.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input array can contain duplicate elements, and the power operation should be performed modulo `10^9 + 7` to avoid overflow.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2`
  Output: `70`
  Explanation: The sum of all 2-size subarrays is `(1 + 2) + (2 + 3) + (3 + 4) = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15`. The 2nd power of 15 is `15^2 = 225`. However, we need to take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is `225 % (10^9 + 7) = 70`.
- Input: `nums = [9, 9], k = 2`
  Output: `32`
  Explanation: The sum of all 2-size subarrays is `(9 + 9) = 18`. The 2nd power of 18 is `18^2 = 324`. However, we need to take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is `324 % (10^9 + 7) = 32`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can calculate the sum of each `k`-size subarray and then take the `k`-th power of this sum.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Calculate the sum of each `k`-size subarray.
  2. Take the `k`-th power of this sum.
  3. Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that directly implements the problem statement.

```cpp
int kthPower(int* nums, int numsSize, int k) {
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= numsSize - k; i++) {
        long long subarraySum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
            subarraySum += nums[j];
        }
        sum += subarraySum;
    }
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        result = (result * sum) % (1000000007);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we have two nested loops: one to generate all `k`-size subarrays and another to calculate the `k`-th power of the sum.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and the result.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are using a brute force approach that involves calculating the sum of each `k`-size subarray and then taking the `k`-th power of this sum. The space complexity is low because we are not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the concept of prefix sums to calculate the sum of each `k`-size subarray in constant time.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the prefix sums of the input array.
  2. Use the prefix sums to calculate the sum of each `k`-size subarray in constant time.
  3. Take the `k`-th power of the sum of all `k`-size subarrays.
  4. Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot k)$, which is the best we can achieve because we need to generate all `k`-size subarrays.

```cpp
int kthPower(int* nums, int numsSize, int k) {
    long long prefixSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        prefixSum += nums[i];
    }
    long long sum = prefixSum;
    for (int i = k; i < numsSize; i++) {
        prefixSum = prefixSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
        sum += prefixSum;
    }
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        result = (result * sum) % (1000000007);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we are using a single loop to generate all `k`-size subarrays and calculate their sum.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the prefix sum and the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are using a prefix sum array to calculate the sum of each `k`-size subarray in constant time, which reduces the time complexity from $O(n \cdot k \cdot k)$ to $O(n \cdot k)$.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Prefix sums, modular arithmetic.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using prefix sums to calculate the sum of subarrays, using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity by using prefix sums, avoiding overflow by using modular arithmetic.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems involving prefix sums, modular arithmetic, and subarray calculations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow, not using prefix sums to calculate the sum of subarrays.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input array, input array with a single element, `k` equal to the length of the input array.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using prefix sums to calculate the sum of subarrays, not using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.
- Testing considerations: Test the implementation with different input sizes, test the implementation with different values of `k`, test the implementation with edge cases.
