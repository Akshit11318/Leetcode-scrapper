## Merge Similar Items
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-similar-items/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves merging similar items from two lists based on their `value` and `weight`. The input is two lists of pairs, where each pair represents an item with a `value` and a `weight`.
- Expected output format: The task is to merge items with the same `value` and return a list of pairs, where each pair contains the merged `value` and the sum of `weights`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The items are considered similar if they have the same `value`. The output should be sorted in descending order based on the `value`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1:
    - Input: `items1 = [[1,1],[4,5],[3,8]]`, `items2 = [[3,1],[1,7]]`
    - Output: `[[1,8],[3,9],[4,5]]`
    - Explanation: The items with `value` 1 are merged to have a total `weight` of 8. Similarly, items with `value` 3 are merged to have a total `weight` of 9.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to iterate through both lists, compare each pair of items, and merge them if they have the same `value`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty list to store the merged items.
  2. Iterate through the first list of items.
  3. For each item in the first list, iterate through the second list to find items with the same `value`.
  4. If an item with the same `value` is found, merge the `weights` and add the merged item to the result list.
  5. If no item with the same `value` is found in the second list, add the current item from the first list to the result list.
  6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the second list of items, but this time merge items from the second list with the items already in the result list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly addresses the requirement to merge items with the same `value`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Define a struct to represent an item
struct Item {
    int value;
    int weight;
};

// Comparison function for sorting items
bool compareItems(const Item& a, const Item& b) {
    return a.value > b.value;
}

vector<vector<int>> mergeSimilarItems(vector<vector<int>>& items1, vector<vector<int>>& items2) {
    // Create a map to store merged items
    map<int, int> mergedItems;

    // Merge items from the first list
    for (const auto& item : items1) {
        mergedItems[item[0]] += item[1];
    }

    // Merge items from the second list
    for (const auto& item : items2) {
        mergedItems[item[0]] += item[1];
    }

    // Create the result vector
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    for (const auto& pair : mergedItems) {
        result.push_back({pair.first, pair.second});
    }

    // Sort the result in descending order based on the value
    sort(result.begin(), result.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        return a[0] > b[0];
    });

    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    vector<vector<int>> items1 = {{1,1},{4,5},{3,8}};
    vector<vector<int>> items2 = {{3,1},{1,7}};

    vector<vector<int>> result = mergeSimilarItems(items1, items2);

    // Print the result
    for (const auto& item : result) {
        cout << "[" << item[0] << "," << item[1] << "] ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m + k \log k)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the sizes of the input lists, and $k$ is the number of unique `value`s. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, as we store all items in the map and then in the result vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we iterate through both lists, perform a constant amount of work for each item, and then sort the result. The space complexity occurs because we store all merged items in the map and the result vector.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a map to store the merged items. This allows us to look up and merge items with the same `value` in constant time.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a map to store the merged items, where each key is a `value` and the corresponding value is the sum of `weights`.
  2. Iterate through both input lists and merge items into the map.
  3. Create the result vector from the map and sort it in descending order based on the `value`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a map to store and merge items, which allows for constant-time lookups and insertions. The sorting operation at the end has a time complexity of $O(k \log k)$, where $k$ is the number of unique `value`s.

```cpp
// The optimal approach is already implemented in the brute force section, as it turns out that using a map and sorting is the most efficient way to solve this problem.
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Using a map to store and merge items, sorting a vector of vectors.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a data structure to efficiently store and retrieve items, sorting data to meet output requirements.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a map to reduce the time complexity of lookups and insertions.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve merging or combining data based on certain criteria.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to sort the result, using an inefficient data structure to store merged items.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling empty input lists, handling lists with duplicate `value`s.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a data structure with high time complexity for lookups or insertions, such as a vector or list.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input lists, including empty lists and lists with duplicate `value`s.
