## Transpose File
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-file/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a file with a series of lines, each containing a series of space-separated numbers. The task is to transpose this file, meaning to swap rows with columns.
- Expected output format: The output should be a file with the same numbers but with rows and columns transposed.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input file can be large, and the task should be performed efficiently. The output file should have the same numbers as the input file but with rows and columns swapped.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If the input file contains:
    ```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
    The output file should contain:
    ```
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
    ```

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Read the entire file into memory, transpose the data, and then write it back to a file.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Read the input file line by line.
  2. Split each line into numbers and store them in a 2D array.
  3. Transpose the 2D array.
  4. Write the transposed array to the output file.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most straightforward way to solve the problem, as it directly addresses the task of transposing the file.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

void transposeFile(const std::string& inputFile, const std::string& outputFile) {
    std::ifstream input(inputFile);
    std::ofstream output(outputFile);

    if (!input.is_open() || !output.is_open()) {
        // Handle file opening errors
        return;
    }

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> data;
    std::string line;

    // Read the input file
    while (std::getline(input, line)) {
        std::istringstream iss(line);
        std::vector<int> row;
        int num;

        while (iss >> num) {
            row.push_back(num);
        }

        data.push_back(row);
    }

    // Transpose the data
    int rows = data.size();
    int cols = data[0].size();
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> transposed(cols, std::vector<int>(rows));

    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            transposed[j][i] = data[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Write the transposed data to the output file
    for (const auto& row : transposed) {
        for (int num : row) {
            output << num << " ";
        }
        output << "\n";
    }
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of rows and $m$ is the number of columns in the input file. This is because we read each number once, transpose the data, and then write it back.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, as we store the entire file in memory.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a constant amount of work for each number in the file. The space complexity is also linear because we store all the numbers in memory at once.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of reading the entire file into memory, we can process it row by row, transposing the data as we go. However, since the problem requires us to transpose the file, we need to know the total number of rows and columns beforehand to efficiently write the transposed data to the output file.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. First pass: Read the input file to determine the number of rows and columns.
  2. Second pass: Read the input file again, this time transposing the data and writing it to the output file.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires two passes over the input file and uses a constant amount of extra memory to store the current row being processed.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Any solution must at least read the input file once, resulting in a time complexity of at least $O(n \cdot m)$.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

void transposeFile(const std::string& inputFile, const std::string& outputFile) {
    std::ifstream input(inputFile);
    std::ofstream output(outputFile);

    if (!input.is_open() || !output.is_open()) {
        // Handle file opening errors
        return;
    }

    // First pass: Determine the number of rows and columns
    int rows = 0;
    int cols = 0;
    std::string line;

    while (std::getline(input, line)) {
        rows++;
        std::istringstream iss(line);
        int num;

        if (cols == 0) {
            while (iss >> num) {
                cols++;
            }
        }
    }

    input.clear();
    input.seekg(0);

    // Second pass: Transpose the data
    std::vector<int> row(cols);
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        std::getline(input, line);
        std::istringstream iss(line);

        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            iss >> row[j];
        }

        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            output << row[j] << " ";
            if (i == rows - 1) {
                output << "\n";
            } else {
                output << "\n" << std::string(j * 2 + 1, ' ') << row[j] << " ";
            }
        }
    }
}
```
