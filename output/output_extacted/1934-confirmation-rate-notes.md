## Confirmation Rate
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/confirmation-rate/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two tables, `accounts` and `confirmations`, with `id` and `email` columns in `accounts`, and `account_id` and `confirmation_date` columns in `confirmations`.
- Constraints: `accounts` table contains at least one row, `confirmations` table may be empty, and `account_id` in `confirmations` is a foreign key referencing `id` in `accounts`.
- Expected output format: The rate of confirmed accounts as a decimal value rounded to four decimal places.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where there are no confirmations, ensuring the rate calculation is accurate, and considering the precision of the output.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Test case 1: `accounts` table with two rows and `confirmations` table with one row, demonstrating partial confirmation.
  - Test case 2: `accounts` table with one row and `confirmations` table with one row, demonstrating full confirmation.
  - Test case 3: `accounts` table with multiple rows and `confirmations` table with multiple rows, demonstrating varied confirmation rates.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the total number of accounts and the number of confirmed accounts by joining the `accounts` and `confirmations` tables on `account_id`, then divide the number of confirmed accounts by the total number of accounts.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Select all rows from the `accounts` table to get the total number of accounts.
  2. Perform an inner join between the `accounts` and `confirmations` tables on the `account_id` to get the confirmed accounts.
  3. Count the distinct `account_id`s from the joined table to get the number of confirmed accounts.
  4. Divide the number of confirmed accounts by the total number of accounts and round the result to four decimal places.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the need to calculate a confirmation rate based on the given tables and their relationships.

```cpp
SELECT ROUND(
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.account_id) / 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM accounts), 
    4) AS confirmation_rate
FROM accounts a
LEFT JOIN confirmations c ON a.id = c.account_id;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of rows in the `accounts` table, because in the worst case, we are scanning each row once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the intermediate results of the join operation.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear due to the join and count operations, and the space complexity is also linear because we potentially need to store all rows from both tables in memory during the join operation.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of using a join, which can be expensive for large tables, we can use subqueries or direct counts to calculate the confirmation rate more efficiently.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use a subquery to count the distinct `account_id`s in the `confirmations` table, which gives the number of confirmed accounts.
  2. Use a simple `COUNT(*)` query on the `accounts` table to get the total number of accounts.
  3. Divide the number of confirmed accounts by the total number of accounts and round the result to four decimal places.
- Proof of optimality: This approach minimizes the number of operations and does not require joining the two tables, which can significantly reduce the computational cost for large datasets.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach directly calculates the required rate with the minimum necessary operations, making it optimal.

```cpp
SELECT ROUND(
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT account_id) FROM confirmations) / 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM accounts), 
    4) AS confirmation_rate;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `accounts` table and $m$ is the number of rows in the `confirmations` table, because we are scanning each table once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are only storing the counts, which does not depend on the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most efficient way to calculate the confirmation rate because it involves the minimum number of operations (two counts) and does not require any join operations, which can be costly for large datasets.
