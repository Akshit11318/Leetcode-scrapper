## Customer Order Frequency
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/customer-order-frequency/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem provides three tables: `Customers`, `Orders`, and `Order_Items`. The goal is to find the customer_id and name of customers who have placed an order for a specific product_name in 2020 and 2021.
- Expected output format: A table with `customer_id` and `name`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling missing or duplicate data, ensuring correct date filtering, and joining tables correctly.
- Example test cases with explanations: Given sample data, verify that the query correctly identifies customers who ordered a specific product in both years.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Start by filtering orders for the specific product and years, then join this result with the customers table to get customer information.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Filter `Order_Items` to get `order_id`s for the specific product in both years.
  2. Join the filtered `Order_Items` with `Orders` to get `customer_id`s.
  3. Join the result with `Customers` to get `customer_id` and `name`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem by filtering and joining relevant tables.

```cpp
// Assuming a SQL-like solution as the problem seems to be SQL-based
SELECT C.customer_id, C.name
FROM Customers C
JOIN (
    SELECT O.customer_id
    FROM Orders O
    JOIN (
        SELECT order_id
        FROM Order_Items
        WHERE product_name = 'specific_product_name'
    ) AS OI ON O.order_id = OI.order_id
    WHERE YEAR(O.order_date) IN (2020, 2021)
) AS O ON C.customer_id = O.customer_id
GROUP BY C.customer_id, C.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT YEAR(O.order_date)) = 2;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot p)$, where $n$ is the number of customers, $m$ is the number of orders, and $p$ is the number of order items. This is because in the worst case, we might have to scan all rows in each table.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m + p)$, for storing the intermediate results of joins and filtering.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves multiple joins and filtering operations, leading to these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Utilize SQL's ability to filter and group data more efficiently by leveraging indexes and optimizing the join order.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Ensure indexes exist on `Orders.order_date`, `Order_Items.product_name`, and `Orders.customer_id` for faster filtering and joining.
  2. Optimize the query to reduce the number of rows being joined by filtering early.
  3. Use `EXISTS` or `IN` instead of joins where possible to reduce the dataset size.
- Proof of optimality: This approach minimizes the number of rows being processed and utilizes database optimizations for filtering and joining.

```sql
SELECT C.customer_id, C.name
FROM Customers C
WHERE C.customer_id IN (
    SELECT O.customer_id
    FROM Orders O
    WHERE O.order_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
    AND O.order_id IN (
        SELECT order_id
        FROM Order_Items
        WHERE product_name = 'specific_product_name'
    )
)
AND C.customer_id IN (
    SELECT O.customer_id
    FROM Orders O
    WHERE O.order_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
    AND O.order_id IN (
        SELECT order_id
        FROM Order_Items
        WHERE product_name = 'specific_product_name'
    )
);
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m + p)$, where $n$, $m$, and $p$ are the number of rows in `Customers`, `Orders`, and `Order_Items` respectively, that match the filter conditions. This is because we're filtering and joining more efficiently.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m + p)$, for storing the intermediate results, but this is significantly reduced due to efficient filtering.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the amount of data being processed by filtering early and utilizing efficient join and subquery strategies.
