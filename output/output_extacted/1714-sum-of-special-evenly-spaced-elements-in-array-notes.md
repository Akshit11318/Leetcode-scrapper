## Sum of Special Evenly Spaced Elements in Array

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-special-evenly-spaced-elements-in-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 100`.
- Expected output format: The sum of special evenly spaced elements.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The array can be of any size between 1 and 100.
  - The elements can be any integer.
  - The array can contain duplicate elements.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output should be `3` because the special evenly spaced elements are `1` and `3`.
  - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the output should be `9` because the special evenly spaced elements are `1`, `3`, and `5`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To solve this problem, we can start by generating all possible subsets of the given array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of the array.
  2. For each subset, calculate the difference between consecutive elements.
  3. Check if the differences are equal, if so, it's a special evenly spaced subset.
  4. Calculate the sum of the elements in the subset.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is intuitive because it checks all possible subsets and calculates the sum of the special evenly spaced subsets.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int sumSpecialEvenlySpacedElements(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << nums.size()); mask++) {
        std::vector<int> subset;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                subset.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        if (subset.size() > 1) {
            int diff = subset[1] - subset[0];
            bool isSpecial = true;
            for (int i = 2; i < subset.size(); i++) {
                if (subset[i] - subset[i - 1] != diff) {
                    isSpecial = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isSpecial) {
                sum += std::accumulate(subset.begin(), subset.end(), 0);
            }
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we generate all possible subsets and calculate the sum of the elements in each subset.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we store the current subset in memory.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we use a brute force approach to generate all possible subsets and calculate the sum of the elements in each subset.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the fact that the special evenly spaced elements are the elements at the beginning and end of each subset.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the sum of the elements at the beginning and end of each subset.
  2. Return the sum of the special evenly spaced elements.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the array and does not generate all possible subsets.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it only requires a single pass through the array.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int sumSpecialEvenlySpacedElements(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
        if (i + 1 < nums.size()) {
            sum += nums[i + 1];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we only require a single pass through the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the array and does not generate all possible subsets.
