## Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-uni-value-grid/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an `m x n` grid, where each cell can have one of `k` values. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to make all cells in the grid have the same value.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The grid can be empty, and there might be multiple values in the grid.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For the grid `[[2,4],[6,8]]`, the minimum number of operations is 4.
  - For the grid `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]`, the minimum number of operations is 7.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward approach is to try all possible values for each cell and calculate the minimum number of operations required to make all cells have the same value.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over all possible values for each cell.
  2. For each value, calculate the number of operations required to make all cells have that value.
  3. Keep track of the minimum number of operations found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a simple and intuitive approach, but it's not efficient for large grids.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    
    // Iterate over all possible values
    for (int val = 0; val <= 100; val++) {
        int ops = 0;
        // Calculate the number of operations required for each cell
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                ops += abs(grid[i][j] - val);
            }
        }
        // Update the minimum number of operations
        minOps = min(minOps, ops);
    }
    
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n \cdot k)$, where $m$ is the number of rows, $n$ is the number of columns, and $k$ is the number of possible values. The reason is that we're iterating over all possible values and calculating the number of operations required for each cell.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're only using a constant amount of space to store the minimum number of operations.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because of the nested loops, and the space complexity occurs because we're not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The minimum number of operations required to make all cells have the same value is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between each cell's value and the median value of all cells.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the median value of all cells in the grid.
  2. Calculate the sum of the absolute differences between each cell's value and the median value.
- Proof of optimality: The median value is the value that minimizes the sum of the absolute differences, as it's the value that's closest to the majority of the cells.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$, which is the minimum time complexity required to process all cells in the grid.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    vector<int> values;
    
    // Collect all values in the grid
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            values.push_back(grid[i][j]);
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate the median value
    sort(values.begin(), values.end());
    int median = values[values.size() / 2];
    
    // Calculate the sum of the absolute differences
    int ops = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            ops += abs(grid[i][j] - median);
        }
    }
    
    return ops;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n \cdot log(m \cdot n))$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. The reason is that we're sorting all values in the grid.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, as we're storing all values in the grid in a separate vector.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because we need to process all cells in the grid, and the space complexity is optimal because we need to store all values in the grid to calculate the median value.

- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding the median value or minimizing the sum of absolute differences.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty grid.
- Edge cases to watch for: An empty grid, or a grid with a single cell.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that has a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different grid sizes and values to ensure it's working correctly.
