## Minimum Operations to Make the Integer Zero
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-integer-zero/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `n`, an integer
- Output: The minimum number of operations to make `n` zero, where an operation is defined as either subtracting 1 from `n` or subtracting `n` from itself (essentially, subtracting `n` once, which can be thought of as a single operation).
- Key requirements: Find the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to 0.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `n = 39`
    - Output: `3` (Explanation: `39 -> 3 -> 0` in three steps)
  - Input: `n = 54`
    - Output: `3` (Explanation: `54 -> 6 -> 3 -> 0` in three steps)

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves iteratively trying all possible combinations of operations to see which sequence leads to the minimum number of operations.
- However, this approach is impractical for large `n` due to its exponential time complexity.

```cpp
int minimumOperations(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    int minOps = n; // If we only subtract 1 each time
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int ops = 0, temp = n;
        while (temp > 0) {
            if (temp >= i) {
                temp -= i;
                ops++;
            } else {
                temp -= 1;
                ops++;
            }
        }
        minOps = min(minOps, ops);
    }
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ because for each potential divisor `i`, we're potentially iterating `n` times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ since we're using a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks every possible divisor of `n`, leading to a quadratic time complexity due to the nested loop structure.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight here is recognizing that the optimal strategy involves using the largest possible divisor of `n` at each step, which effectively reduces `n` to its smallest factor in the fewest steps.
- This problem can be solved using a mathematical approach based on the prime factorization of `n`. However, a simpler and more intuitive approach involves recognizing that the optimal strategy is to always subtract the largest possible factor of `n` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(n)` or simply `n/2` if `n` is even, because we want to reduce `n` as quickly as possible.

```cpp
int minimumOperations(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
        } else {
            n -= 1;
        }
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(log(n))$ because in the worst case, we divide `n` by 2 in each iteration until `n` becomes 0.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ since we're using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations by always choosing the largest possible reduction (either dividing by 2 if `n` is even or subtracting 1 if `n` is odd), thus reducing `n` to 0 in the fewest steps possible.
