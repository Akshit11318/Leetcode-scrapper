## Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-combination-with-bitwise-and-greater-than-zero/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a non-empty array of integers `candidates` containing non-negative integers.
- The function `largestCombination` takes this array as input and should return the size of the largest combination of integers in `candidates` such that their bitwise AND is greater than zero.
- The input array `candidates` contains integers in the range $[0, 2^{31} - 1]$.
- The function should return the size of the largest combination of integers in `candidates` that satisfies the bitwise AND condition.

**Expected Output Format:**
- The function should return an integer representing the size of the largest combination.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases to Consider:**
- The input array can contain duplicate integers.
- The function should handle edge cases where the input array is empty or contains a single element.
- The function should also handle cases where all integers in the array are zero.

**Example Test Cases with Explanations:**
- For the input `candidates = [16,17,71]`, the function should return `2` because the bitwise AND of `16` and `17` is `16`, which is greater than zero.
- For the input `candidates = [100]`, the function should return `1` because the bitwise AND of a single number is the number itself.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The brute force approach involves generating all possible combinations of integers in the input array `candidates`.
- For each combination, calculate the bitwise AND of all integers in the combination.
- If the bitwise AND is greater than zero, update the maximum combination size if the current combination size is larger.
- This approach comes to mind first because it ensures that all possible combinations are considered.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int largestCombination(vector<int>& candidates) {
    int n = candidates.size();
    int maxCombinationSize = 0;
    
    // Generate all possible combinations
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
        int combinationSize = 0;
        int bitwiseAND = ~0; // Initialize with all bits set
        
        // Calculate the bitwise AND for the current combination
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                combinationSize++;
                bitwiseAND &= candidates[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Update the maximum combination size if the bitwise AND is greater than zero
        if (bitwiseAND > 0) {
            maxCombinationSize = max(maxCombinationSize, combinationSize);
        }
    }
    
    return maxCombinationSize;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of integers in the input array `candidates`. The $2^n$ factor comes from generating all possible combinations, and the $n$ factor comes from calculating the bitwise AND for each combination.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because only a constant amount of space is used to store the maximum combination size and the current combination size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates all possible combinations, resulting in exponential time complexity. The space complexity is constant because only a fixed amount of space is used to store the necessary variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach involves iterating over each bit position from 0 to 31 (since integers are 32 bits).
- For each bit position, count the number of integers in the input array `candidates` that have the bit set at that position.
- The maximum combination size is the maximum count across all bit positions.
- This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the maximum combination size without generating all possible combinations.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int largestCombination(vector<int>& candidates) {
    int maxCombinationSize = 0;
    
    // Iterate over each bit position
    for (int bitPosition = 0; bitPosition < 32; ++bitPosition) {
        int count = 0;
        
        // Count the number of integers with the bit set at the current position
        for (int candidate : candidates) {
            if ((candidate & (1 << bitPosition)) != 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        // Update the maximum combination size
        maxCombinationSize = max(maxCombinationSize, count);
    }
    
    return maxCombinationSize;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot 32)$, where $n$ is the number of integers in the input array `candidates`. The $n$ factor comes from iterating over the input array, and the $32$ factor comes from iterating over each bit position.

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the maximum combination size without generating all possible combinations, resulting in a significant reduction in time complexity.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The problem demonstrates the importance of **bit manipulation** and **bitwise operations**.
- The optimal approach shows how to **reduce time complexity** by avoiding the generation of all possible combinations.
- The problem also highlights the importance of **iterating over bit positions** to calculate the maximum combination size.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- **Generating all possible combinations** can result in exponential time complexity, which is unnecessary for this problem.
- **Not considering each bit position** can lead to incorrect results, as the maximum combination size depends on the count of integers with the bit set at each position.
- **Not using bitwise operations** can make the code more complex and less efficient.
