## Find the First Player to Win K Games in a Row

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-first-player-to-win-k-games-in-a-row/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: `vector<int> wins`, `int k`
- Constraints: `1 <= wins.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= k <= 10^5`, `wins[i]` is either `1` or `2`
- Expected output format: The index of the first player to win `k` games in a row, or `-1` if no player wins `k` games in a row
- Key requirements: Find the first player to win `k` games in a row, or return `-1` if no such player exists
- Example test cases:
  - `wins = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`, `k = 3`, output: `4` because player `1` wins `3` games in a row starting from index `4`
  - `wins = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, `k = 3`, output: `-1` because no player wins `3` games in a row

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check every possible subarray of length `k` in the `wins` array to see if all elements in the subarray are the same
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate over the `wins` array with two nested loops to generate all possible subarrays of length `k`
  2. For each subarray, check if all elements are the same
  3. If a subarray with all elements the same is found, return the starting index of the subarray
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach to solve the problem

```cpp
int findFirstPlayerToWinKGamesInARow(vector<int> wins, int k) {
    int n = wins.size();
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
        bool allSame = true;
        for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
            if (wins[j] != wins[i]) {
                allSame = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (allSame) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the `wins` array, because we are using two nested loops to generate all possible subarrays of length `k`
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the indices and the `allSame` flag
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are checking every possible subarray of length `k`, and the space complexity is low because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of checking every possible subarray, we can use a sliding window approach to keep track of the current subarray and its elements
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a sliding window of size `k`
  2. Iterate over the `wins` array, and for each element, check if it is the same as the first element of the current window
  3. If the element is the same, move the window one step to the right
  4. If the element is different, reset the window to start from the current element
  5. If the window reaches the end of the array, return the starting index of the window
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem because we must at least read the input array once

```cpp
int findFirstPlayerToWinKGamesInARow(vector<int> wins, int k) {
    int n = wins.size();
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
        bool allSame = true;
        for (int j = 1; j < k; j++) {
            if (wins[i + j] != wins[i]) {
                allSame = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (allSame) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

However, we can further optimize this by using a single loop and keeping track of the count of consecutive wins for each player.

```cpp
int findFirstPlayerToWinKGamesInARow(vector<int> wins, int k) {
    int n = wins.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i >= k - 1) {
            bool allSame = true;
            for (int j = 1; j < k; j++) {
                if (wins[i - j + 1] != wins[i - k + 1]) {
                    allSame = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (allSame) {
                return i - k + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sliding window approach, iteration over arrays
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a single loop to iterate over the array, keeping track of consecutive wins
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the number of loops, using a single loop to iterate over the array
- Similar problems to practice: Problems that involve finding consecutive elements in an array, such as finding the longest increasing subsequence

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Using two nested loops to generate all possible subarrays, not checking for edge cases
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where `k` is greater than the length of the `wins` array, the case where the `wins` array is empty
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that has a high time complexity
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input arrays and values of `k`, testing the function with edge cases.
