## Maximum Total Area Occupied by Pistons

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-area-occupied-by-pistons/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of `n` integers representing the positions of pistons, and an integer `k` representing the number of pistons that can be removed.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `0 <= k <= n`.
- Expected Output: The maximum total area occupied by the pistons after removing `k` pistons.
- Key Requirements: The area occupied by a piston is the distance between it and its nearest neighbor to the left, if it exists, or the distance between it and the left boundary, otherwise. The area is calculated as the product of the distance and the piston's width, which is assumed to be 1.
- Edge Cases:
  - When `k` is 0, no pistons are removed.
  - When `k` is equal to `n`, all pistons are removed, resulting in an area of 0.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Example 1: Input: `positions = [1, 3, 5, 7], k = 1`. Output: `8`. Explanation: Remove the piston at position 5. The remaining pistons occupy areas of 1*1 = 1, 2*1 = 2, and 2*1 = 2, respectively, resulting in a total area of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. However, considering the optimal approach, we should remove the piston at position 3, resulting in areas of 2*1 = 2 and 4*1 = 4, giving a total area of 2 + 4 = 6. This was an error in initial understanding; the correct approach should directly lead to the optimal solution without intermediate incorrect assumptions.
- Example 2: Input: `positions = [1, 2, 4, 5], k = 2`. Output: `3`. Explanation: Remove the pistons at positions 2 and 5. The remaining pistons occupy areas of 1*1 = 1 and 1*1 = 1, respectively, and the distance between them and the left boundary or their nearest neighbor to the left is considered for area calculation.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking all possible combinations of removing `k` pistons from the `n` positions and calculating the total area for each combination.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all combinations of `k` positions to remove from the `n` piston positions.
  2. For each combination, calculate the new positions after removing the pistons.
  3. Calculate the total area occupied by the remaining pistons.
  4. Keep track of the maximum total area found among all combinations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxArea(vector<int>& positions, int k) {
    int n = positions.size();
    int maxArea = 0;
    
    // Function to calculate area given positions
    auto calculateArea = [&](vector<int>& pos) {
        int area = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < pos.size(); ++i) {
            if (i == 0) {
                area += pos[i];
            } else {
                area += pos[i] - pos[i-1];
            }
        }
        return area;
    };
    
    // Generate all combinations and calculate area
    vector<bool> remove(n, false);
    function<void(int)> generateCombinations = [&](int start) {
        if (start == n) {
            if (count(remove.begin(), remove.end(), true) == k) {
                vector<int> newPositions;
                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                    if (!remove[i]) {
                        newPositions.push_back(positions[i]);
                    }
                }
                maxArea = max(maxArea, calculateArea(newPositions));
            }
        } else {
            remove[start] = true;
            generateCombinations(start + 1);
            remove[start] = false;
            generateCombinations(start + 1);
        }
    };
    generateCombinations(0);
    
    return maxArea;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of pistons. This is because we are generating all possible combinations of removing `k` pistons, which can be done in $2^n$ ways in the worst case.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the current combination of positions to remove and the new positions after removal.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible combinations, which leads to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the storage needed for the current combination and new positions.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the maximum total area after removing `k` pistons.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Sort the piston positions in ascending order.
  2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total area that can be achieved by considering the first `i` pistons and removing `j` pistons.
  3. Fill the `dp` array using a bottom-up approach, considering all possible removals of pistons.

```cpp
int maxAreaOptimal(vector<int>& positions, int k) {
    int n = positions.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= min(i, k); ++j) {
            if (j == 0) {
                // No pistons removed
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (i == 1 ? positions[i-1] : positions[i-1] - positions[i-2]);
            } else {
                // Consider removing the current piston
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + (i == 1 ? positions[i-1] : positions[i-1] - positions[i-2]));
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][k];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(nk)$, where $n$ is the number of pistons and $k$ is the number of pistons to remove. This is because we are filling a 2D array of size $(n+1) \times (k+1)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(nk)$, for storing the `dp` array.
> - **Optimality proof:** The dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider all possible removals of pistons and calculate the maximum total area efficiently, avoiding the exponential time complexity of the brute force approach.
