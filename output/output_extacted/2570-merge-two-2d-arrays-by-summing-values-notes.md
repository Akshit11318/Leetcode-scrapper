## Merge Two 2D Arrays by Summing Values

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-2d-arrays-by-summing-values/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Two 2D arrays, `a` and `b`, where each array can have different numbers of rows and columns, but they both must have the same number of elements. The elements are integers.
- Expected output format: A new 2D array where each element is the sum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The arrays must have the same total number of elements. The number of rows and columns in the output array should match the input arrays' configuration.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - If `a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `b = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the output should be `[[6, 8], [10, 12]]`.
  - If `a = [[1], [2], [3]]` and `b = [[4], [5], [6]]`, the output should be `[[5], [7], [9]]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Since the arrays must have the same number of elements, we can flatten them, sum corresponding elements, and then reshape the result to match one of the input arrays' dimensions.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Flatten both arrays into 1D arrays.
  2. Iterate over the elements of the flattened arrays, summing corresponding elements.
  3. Determine the dimensions of one of the input arrays.
  4. Reshape the summed array into a 2D array matching the chosen input array's dimensions.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> mergeArrays(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& a, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& b) {
    // Calculate total elements in a and b
    int totalElements = a.size() * a[0].size();
    
    // Flatten arrays
    std::vector<int> flatA, flatB;
    for (auto& row : a) {
        for (int val : row) {
            flatA.push_back(val);
        }
    }
    for (auto& row : b) {
        for (int val : row) {
            flatB.push_back(val);
        }
    }
    
    // Sum corresponding elements
    for (int i = 0; i < totalElements; ++i) {
        flatA[i] += flatB[i];
    }
    
    // Reshape the summed array into a 2D array
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> result(a.size(), std::vector<int>(a[0].size()));
    int index = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < a[0].size(); ++j) {
            result[i][j] = flatA[index++];
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ where $n$ and $m$ are the dimensions of one of the input arrays, because we're iterating over each element once to flatten, sum, and then reshape.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ for storing the flattened arrays and the result, where $n \cdot m$ is the total number of elements in the arrays.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The iteration over all elements in both arrays to perform the sum and the storage of these elements in new data structures dictate the time and space complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of flattening and then reshaping, we can directly sum corresponding elements from `a` and `b` into a new 2D array, assuming we know the dimensions of one of the arrays.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Determine the dimensions of one of the input arrays.
  2. Create a new 2D array with the same dimensions.
  3. Iterate over the elements of both input arrays, summing corresponding elements and placing the sums in the new array.

```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<int>> mergeArraysOptimal(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& a, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& b) {
    int rowsA = a.size();
    int colsA = a[0].size();
    int index = 0;
    
    // Create result array with same dimensions as a
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> result(rowsA, std::vector<int>(colsA));
    
    // Iterate over b's elements and sum with a's corresponding elements
    for (int i = 0; i < rowsA; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < colsA; ++j) {
            result[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[index / colsA][index % colsA];
            index++;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ for storing the result, where $n \cdot m$ is the total number of elements in the arrays.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we must at least read the input arrays and write the output array, which requires $O(n \cdot m)$ time and space.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, array manipulation, and understanding of how to calculate and work with array dimensions.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The importance of understanding the problem constraints and using them to simplify the solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary operations like flattening and reshaping when direct iteration and calculation can achieve the same result more efficiently.
- Similar problems to practice: Other array manipulation and iteration challenges.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating array dimensions or indices, not checking for edge cases like empty arrays.
- Edge cases to watch for: Arrays with different numbers of elements, empty arrays.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures that lead to higher time or space complexity than necessary.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with arrays of different sizes, including edge cases like single-element arrays or arrays with a single row or column.
