## Number of Distinct Binary Strings After Applying Operations
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-distinct-binary-Strings-after-applying-operations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an integer `n` and an array of integers `operations` where each operation is represented as an array `[start, end]`, find the number of distinct binary strings of length `n` that can be obtained after applying all operations.
- Each operation flips all bits in the range `[start, end]`.
- The input array `operations` will not be empty and will contain at least one operation.
- Expected output format: The number of distinct binary strings.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling of overlapping operations, boundary cases where start or end indices are 0 or n-1, and ensuring distinctness of resulting binary strings.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `n = 3`, `operations = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]`: After applying the operations, the resulting strings will be distinct because each operation flips a different range of bits.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible binary strings of length `n`, apply all operations to each string, and count the distinct results.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible binary strings of length `n`. There are $2^n$ such strings.
  2. For each binary string, apply all operations in the given order.
  3. After applying all operations to a string, add it to a set to automatically eliminate duplicates.
  4. The size of the set will be the number of distinct binary strings after applying all operations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that considers all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int numDistinctStrings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& operations) {
    // Generate all possible binary strings of length n
    int total = 1 << n; // 2^n
    set<string> distinctStrings;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < total; ++i) {
        string binaryString = "";
        int temp = i;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            binaryString = (temp & 1 ? '1' : '0') + binaryString;
            temp >>= 1;
        }
        
        // Apply all operations to the current binary string
        string result = binaryString;
        for (auto& op : operations) {
            for (int k = op[0]; k <= op[1]; ++k) {
                result[k] = (result[k] == '0') ? '1' : '0';
            }
        }
        
        // Add the resulting string to the set
        distinctStrings.insert(result);
    }
    
    return distinctStrings.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the length of the binary strings and $m$ is the number of operations. This is because we generate all possible binary strings ($2^n$), and for each string, we apply all operations ($m$) which involves flipping bits in a range up to $n$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^n)$ for storing all generated binary strings in the worst case.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach considers every possible binary string and applies all operations to each, leading to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is also exponential due to storing all distinct strings.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Realizing that the operations essentially partition the string into segments where each segment can be either all zeros or all ones after applying all operations. The distinctness of the resulting strings depends on the number of such segments and their possible combinations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Identify the segments by applying all operations and tracking the ranges that get flipped.
  2. Count the number of distinct segments.
  3. Calculate the number of distinct combinations of these segments, which will be $2^k$ where $k$ is the number of segments.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the number of distinct outcomes without needing to generate all possible binary strings or apply operations to each string individually.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach directly addresses the problem's requirements without unnecessary steps or redundant calculations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int numDistinctStrings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& operations) {
    vector<bool> flipped(n, false);
    
    // Apply all operations and track flipped ranges
    for (auto& op : operations) {
        for (int i = op[0]; i <= op[1]; ++i) {
            flipped[i] = !flipped[i];
        }
    }
    
    // Count the number of distinct segments
    int segments = 0;
    bool inSegment = false;
    for (bool f : flipped) {
        if (f && !inSegment) {
            segments++;
            inSegment = true;
        } else if (!f && inSegment) {
            inSegment = false;
        }
    }
    
    // If the string starts or ends with a flipped segment, adjust the count
    if (flipped[0]) segments++;
    if (flipped[n-1] && !flipped[n-2]) segments++;
    
    // Calculate the number of distinct combinations of these segments
    return 1 << segments;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ where $n$ is the length of the binary strings and $m$ is the number of operations. This is because we apply all operations once and then process the resulting flipped ranges.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the flipped ranges.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach directly calculates the number of distinct outcomes without generating all possible binary strings, making it significantly more efficient than the brute force approach for large $n$.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Segmenting based on operations, counting distinct outcomes without explicit enumeration.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Looking for ways to reduce the problem space by identifying patterns or segments that can be independently combined.
- Optimization techniques learned: Applying operations in a way that allows for direct calculation of distinct outcomes without redundant calculations.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems involving string transformations, segmenting, and counting distinct outcomes.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly applying operations, failing to account for edge cases (e.g., start or end indices of operations).
- Edge cases to watch for: Operations that overlap, operations that start or end at the boundaries of the string.
- Performance pitfalls: Using brute force approaches for large inputs, failing to optimize the calculation of distinct outcomes.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with various operation sets, including edge cases and large inputs.
