## Sort Even and Odd Indices Independently

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-even-and-odd-indices-independently/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer array `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.
- Expected output format: The modified array where even indices are sorted in ascending order and odd indices are sorted in ascending order independently.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle arrays with both even and odd lengths, and ensure that the sorting is done independently for even and odd indices.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `nums = [4,2,5,3]`
    - Expected Output: `[2,4,3,5]`
  - Input: `nums = [3,1,2,4]`
    - Expected Output: `[2,1,4,3]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Separate the numbers at even and odd indices into two different arrays, sort each array, and then reconstruct the original array by alternating between the two sorted arrays.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize two vectors to store numbers at even and odd indices separately.
  2. Iterate through the input array, placing each number into the appropriate vector based on its index.
  3. Sort both vectors in ascending order.
  4. Create a new vector to store the result, alternating between numbers from the two sorted vectors.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the requirement of sorting numbers at even and odd indices independently.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

vector<int> sortEvenOdd(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> even, odd;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            even.push_back(nums[i]);
        } else {
            odd.push_back(nums[i]);
        }
    }
    sort(even.begin(), even.end());
    sort(odd.begin(), odd.end());
    
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < max(even.size(), odd.size()); ++i) {
        if (i < even.size()) {
            result.push_back(even[i]);
        }
        if (i < odd.size()) {
            result.push_back(odd[i]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is due to the sorting operations on the two vectors.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store all elements in the two vectors and the result vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The sorting operation dominates the time complexity, and the need to store all elements in separate vectors contributes to the space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already quite straightforward and efficient for this problem. The key is to ensure that the sorting and reconstruction are done correctly and efficiently.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same steps as the brute force approach apply, with a focus on ensuring that the implementation is clean and efficient.
- Proof of optimality: Given the requirement to sort two separate sets of numbers and then interleave them, the optimal approach must involve sorting, which has a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$ in the general case.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Without additional information or constraints on the input data, further optimization beyond the straightforward sorting and reconstruction approach is not feasible.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

vector<int> sortEvenOdd(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> even, odd;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            even.push_back(nums[i]);
        } else {
            odd.push_back(nums[i]);
        }
    }
    sort(even.begin(), even.end());
    sort(odd.begin(), odd.end());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            nums[i] = even[i / 2];
        } else {
            nums[i] = odd[i / 2];
        }
    }
    return nums;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store all elements in the two vectors.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, array manipulation, and the importance of considering the requirements of the problem carefully.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts (in this case, sorting even and odd indices separately).
- Optimization techniques learned: Ensuring that the implementation is efficient and clean, and recognizing when further optimization is not feasible.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to handle edge cases (e.g., arrays of length 1), and not ensuring that the sorting and reconstruction are done correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Arrays with only one element, or arrays where all elements are at either even or odd indices.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient sorting algorithms or failing to consider the time and space complexity of the solution.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with a variety of input cases, including edge cases.
