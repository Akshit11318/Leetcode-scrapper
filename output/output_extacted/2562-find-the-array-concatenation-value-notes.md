## Find the Array Concatenation Value
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-array-concatenation-value/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums` of length `n`.
- Expected output: The minimum possible integer value that can be obtained by concatenating the elements of `nums` in some order.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The array `nums` can contain both positive and negative integers.
  - The integers in the array can have varying numbers of digits.
  - The goal is to find the arrangement that results in the smallest concatenated integer value.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = [5, 2, 3]`, the smallest possible concatenated integer is `235`.
  - For `nums = [2, 3, 5]`, the smallest possible concatenated integer is `235`.
  - For `nums = [10, 7, 76, 415]`, the smallest possible concatenated integer is `1076415410`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all permutations of the input array and concatenate the integers in each permutation to form a single integer.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of the input array `nums`.
  2. For each permutation, concatenate the integers to form a single integer.
  3. Compare the concatenated integers from all permutations and find the smallest one.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward way to ensure that all possible arrangements are considered.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int compare(const string& a, const string& b) {
    return (a + b).compare(b + a);
}

long long findMinValue(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<string> strNums;
    for (int num : nums) {
        strNums.push_back(to_string(num));
    }
    sort(strNums.begin(), strNums.end(), compare);
    string result;
    for (const string& str : strNums) {
        result += str;
    }
    return stoll(result);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n! \cdot n \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums` and $m$ is the maximum number of digits in an element. This is because there are $n!$ permutations, each taking $O(n \cdot m)$ time to concatenate and compare.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ for storing the permutations and concatenated strings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates all permutations, which leads to an exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear in the total number of digits in the input array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all permutations, we can sort the input array based on a custom comparison function that determines the order of two numbers based on their concatenated values.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Define a comparison function that takes two integers, concatenates them in both orders, and returns the order that results in the smaller concatenated integer.
  2. Sort the input array using this comparison function.
  3. Concatenate the sorted integers to form the smallest possible concatenated integer.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that the smallest possible concatenated integer is formed because it considers the optimal arrangement of each pair of integers.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int compare(const string& a, const string& b) {
    return (a + b).compare(b + a);
}

long long findMinValue(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<string> strNums;
    for (int num : nums) {
        strNums.push_back(to_string(num));
    }
    sort(strNums.begin(), strNums.end(), compare);
    string result;
    for (const string& str : strNums) {
        result += str;
    }
    // Handle the case where the result starts with '0'
    if (result[0] == '0') {
        return 0;
    }
    return stoll(result);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot log(n))$ where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums` and $m$ is the maximum number of digits in an element. This is because sorting the array takes $O(n \cdot log(n))$ time, and the comparison function takes $O(m)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ for storing the strings and the sorted array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it ensures that the smallest possible concatenated integer is formed by considering the optimal arrangement of each pair of integers. The time complexity is reduced significantly compared to the brute force approach.
