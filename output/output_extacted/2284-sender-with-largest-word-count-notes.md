## Sender with Largest Word Count
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sender-with-largest-word-count/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a list of messages where each message is represented as a pair of strings, the first string being the sender's name and the second string being the message content. The task is to find the sender with the largest word count across all their messages.
- Expected output format: The function should return the name of the sender with the largest word count.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The word count should be calculated across all messages sent by each sender. If there are multiple senders with the same maximum word count, any of them can be returned.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1:
    - Input: `messages = [["Alice","Love is the best thing in this world"], ["Bob","Hey there, how are you?"], ["Alice","I am fine, thanks"], ["Bob","I am also fine, thanks"]`
    - Output: `"Alice"`
    - Explanation: Alice has a total of 6 words ("Love is the best thing in this world" + "I am fine, thanks"), while Bob has a total of 8 words ("Hey there, how are you?" + "I am also fine, thanks"). Therefore, Bob should be returned as the sender with the largest word count.
  - Example 2:
    - Input: `messages = [["Alice","What is the best time to go to sleep?"], ["Bob","I think the best time to sleep is at night."], ["Alice","I think the best time to sleep is in the morning."]]`
    - Output: `"Alice"`
    - Explanation: Both Alice and Bob have the same number of words. Either can be returned.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through each message, split the message content into words, and count the words for each sender.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a dictionary to store the word count for each sender.
  2. Iterate through each message in the input list.
  3. For each message, split the message content into words.
  4. Increment the word count in the dictionary for the sender of the current message.
  5. After iterating through all messages, find the sender with the maximum word count.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's the most straightforward way to solve the problem, directly implementing the problem statement.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <unordered_map>

string largestWordCount(vector<vector<string>>& messages) {
    unordered_map<string, int> senderWordCount;
    
    for (auto& message : messages) {
        string sender = message[0];
        string content = message[1];
        stringstream ss(content);
        int wordCount = 0;
        
        string word;
        while (ss >> word) {
            wordCount++;
        }
        
        if (senderWordCount.find(sender) != senderWordCount.end()) {
            senderWordCount[sender] += wordCount;
        } else {
            senderWordCount[sender] = wordCount;
        }
    }
    
    string maxSender;
    int maxCount = 0;
    
    for (auto& pair : senderWordCount) {
        if (pair.second > maxCount) {
            maxCount = pair.second;
            maxSender = pair.first;
        }
    }
    
    return maxSender;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N \cdot M)$, where $N$ is the number of messages and $M$ is the average number of words in a message. This is because we iterate through each message and then through each word in the message.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$, for storing the word count of each sender in the dictionary.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the iteration over messages and words within those messages. The space complexity is due to storing the word count for each unique sender.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already quite optimal as it directly addresses the problem statement with no unnecessary steps. However, we can slightly optimize the code for better readability and efficiency by directly comparing the word count in the loop where we update the sender's word count, thus eliminating the need for a separate loop to find the sender with the maximum word count.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a dictionary to store the word count for each sender.
  2. Initialize variables to keep track of the sender with the maximum word count and the maximum word count itself.
  3. Iterate through each message, splitting the content into words and counting them.
  4. Update the word count for the sender in the dictionary.
  5. If the updated word count is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum word count and the corresponding sender.
- Proof of optimality: This approach still has a time complexity of $O(N \cdot M)$ but reduces the number of iterations and comparisons needed, making it slightly more efficient in practice.

```cpp
string largestWordCount(vector<vector<string>>& messages) {
    unordered_map<string, int> senderWordCount;
    string maxSender;
    int maxCount = 0;
    
    for (auto& message : messages) {
        string sender = message[0];
        string content = message[1];
        stringstream ss(content);
        int wordCount = 0;
        
        string word;
        while (ss >> word) {
            wordCount++;
        }
        
        int totalWordCount = senderWordCount[sender] + wordCount;
        senderWordCount[sender] = totalWordCount;
        
        if (totalWordCount > maxCount) {
            maxCount = totalWordCount;
            maxSender = sender;
        }
    }
    
    return maxSender;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N \cdot M)$, where $N$ is the number of messages and $M$ is the average number of words in a message.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$, for storing the word count of each sender.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity remains the same as the brute force approach because we still need to iterate through all messages and words. However, this version of the code is slightly more efficient due to reduced overhead from fewer iterations and comparisons.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dictionary (unordered_map) usage for efficient storage and retrieval, string manipulation for word counting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Iteration, comparison, and updating of maximum values.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the number of iterations and comparisons.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation and dictionary-based problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling the case where a sender is not yet in the dictionary, failing to update the maximum word count correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Messages with no words, senders with the same maximum word count.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient data structures or algorithms that lead to higher than necessary time complexities.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with a variety of inputs, including edge cases like empty messages or messages with a single word.
