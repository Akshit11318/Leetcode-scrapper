## Divide Array Into Equal Pairs
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-into-equal-pairs/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an integer array `nums`, determine if it can be divided into pairs of equal elements.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if the array can be divided into pairs of equal elements, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: All elements in the array must be paired, and each pair must contain two equal elements.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - Example 1: Input: `nums = [3,3,3,3]`, Output: `true` (can be divided into two pairs of equal elements).
    - Example 2: Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`, Output: `false` (cannot be divided into pairs of equal elements).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check every possible pairing of elements to see if all pairs are equal.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Generate all permutations of the array.
    2. For each permutation, check if it can be divided into pairs of equal elements.
    3. If any permutation can be divided into pairs of equal elements, return `true`.
    4. If no permutation can be divided into pairs of equal elements, return `false`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward, exhaustive approach to solving the problem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

bool canBeDivided(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Generate all permutations of the array
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    do {
        // Check if the current permutation can be divided into pairs of equal elements
        bool valid = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i += 2) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i + 1]) {
                valid = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (valid) {
            return true;
        }
    } while (next_permutation(nums.begin(), nums.end()));
    return false;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n! \cdot \frac{n}{2}) = O(\frac{n \cdot n!}{2})$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we generate all permutations of the array, and for each permutation, we check if it can be divided into pairs of equal elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not counting the space needed for the input array, since we only use a constant amount of space to store the permutation and the result.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we generate all permutations of the array, which has $n!$ permutations. The space complexity is low because we only use a constant amount of space to store the permutation and the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all permutations of the array, we can simply count the occurrences of each element and check if all counts are even.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Count the occurrences of each element in the array using a hash map.
    2. Check if all counts are even.
    3. If all counts are even, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a much lower time complexity than the brute force approach, and it still correctly solves the problem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

bool divideArrayInSets(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> count;
    for (int num : nums) {
        count[num]++;
    }
    for (auto& pair : count) {
        if (pair.second % 2 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we iterate over the array once to count the occurrences of each element, and then iterate over the hash map once to check if all counts are even.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because in the worst case, we need to store all elements in the hash map.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has a linear time complexity, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem since we need to at least read the input array once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Counting occurrences of elements, using hash maps to store counts, and checking if all counts are even.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Instead of generating all permutations of the array, we can use a hash map to count the occurrences of each element and check if all counts are even.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a hash map to store counts instead of generating all permutations of the array.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve counting occurrences of elements and checking if all counts are even.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking if all counts are even, or not using a hash map to store counts.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty arrays, arrays with a single element, and arrays with all elements being the same.
- Performance pitfalls: Generating all permutations of the array instead of using a hash map to store counts.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input arrays, including empty arrays, arrays with a single element, and arrays with all elements being the same.
