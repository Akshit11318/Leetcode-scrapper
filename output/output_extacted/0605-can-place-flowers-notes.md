## Can Place Flowers

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer array `flowerbed` where `flowerbed[i] = 1` if there is a flower in the `i-th` plot and `flowerbed[i] = 0` if there is no flower.
- Constraints: `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 20000`, `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- Expected output format: A boolean indicating whether `n` new flowers can be planted in the flower bed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The flower bed is considered circular, meaning that the first plot is adjacent to the last plot. We need to ensure that no two adjacent plots have flowers.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1` returns `True`.
  - `flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2` returns `False`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can try to plant flowers in each plot one by one, checking if the plot is empty and its adjacent plots are also empty.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each plot in the flower bed.
  2. For each plot, check if it is empty and its adjacent plots are also empty.
  3. If the plot and its adjacent plots are empty, plant a flower in the plot and decrement the count of new flowers to plant.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 until we have planted all new flowers or we have checked all plots.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, as it involves checking each plot individually.

```cpp
bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.size(); i++) {
        if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && (i == 0 || flowerbed[i-1] == 0) && (i == flowerbed.size()-1 || flowerbed[i+1] == 0)) {
            flowerbed[i] = 1;
            count++;
            if (count >= n) return true;
        }
    }
    return count >= n;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m)$ where $m$ is the number of plots in the flower bed. This is because we are iterating through each plot once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are using a simple iterative approach to check each plot.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the same approach as the brute force solution, but with a slight modification to handle the edge cases more efficiently.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate through each plot in the flower bed.
  2. For each plot, check if it is empty and its adjacent plots are also empty.
  3. If the plot and its adjacent plots are empty, plant a flower in the plot and decrement the count of new flowers to plant.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 until we have planted all new flowers or we have checked all plots.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we are checking each plot only once and we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

```cpp
bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
    int count = 0;
    int m = flowerbed.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && (i == 0 || flowerbed[i-1] == 0) && (i == m-1 || flowerbed[i+1] == 0)) {
            flowerbed[i] = 1;
            count++;
        }
        if (count >= n) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are checking each plot only once and we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional checking, and array manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking each plot individually and handling edge cases efficiently.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a simple iterative approach and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve iteration and conditional checking, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in an array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as the first and last plots in the flower bed.
- Edge cases to watch for: The first and last plots in the flower bed, as well as plots that are adjacent to each other.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary complexity or iterating through the array multiple times.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
