## Partitioning into Minimum Number of Deci-Binary Numbers

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/partitioning-into-minimum-number-of-deci-binary-numbers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A string `n` consisting of digits.
- Constraints: $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of deci-binary numbers needed so that they are concatenated together to form the original string `n`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Each digit in the deci-binary numbers can be at most 1, and we need to find the minimum count of such numbers.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For input "32", the output is 3 because "3" can be formed by "111" and "2" can be formed by "2" in deci-binary representation, requiring a total of 3 numbers.
  - For input "82734", the output is 8 because each digit in the string corresponds to the count of 1s in the deci-binary representation of that digit.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through each digit in the string and calculate the maximum possible deci-binary number that can be formed with that digit.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum count of 1s needed for each digit.
  2. Iterate through each character in the string.
  3. For each character, update the maximum count if the current digit is larger.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward to think about comparing each digit individually to determine the minimum count of deci-binary numbers needed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPartitions(string n) {
        int maxDigit = 0;
        for (char c : n) {
            maxDigit = max(maxDigit, c - '0');
        }
        return maxDigit;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string, because we are iterating through each character once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the maximum digit.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear due to the single pass through the string, and the space complexity is constant because we only need to keep track of the maximum digit seen so far.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem essentially asks for the maximum digit in the string because that dictates the minimum number of deci-binary numbers needed to represent the string.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the maximum digit encountered.
  2. Iterate through the string to find the maximum digit.
  3. Return the maximum digit as the minimum count of deci-binary numbers.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly addresses the requirement of finding the minimum count of deci-binary numbers by identifying the maximum digit, which dictates the count.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach already has a linear time complexity and constant space complexity, making it the most efficient solution possible for this problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPartitions(string n) {
        int maxDigit = 0;
        for (char c : n) {
            maxDigit = max(maxDigit, c - '0');
        }
        return maxDigit;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string, because we make a single pass through the string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store the maximum digit.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it achieves the minimum time and space complexity possible for the given problem, directly addressing the requirement with no unnecessary computations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, comparison, and the concept of deci-binary numbers.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Finding the maximum or minimum value in a dataset.
- Optimization techniques learned: Directly addressing the problem statement without introducing unnecessary complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation and comparison problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling the conversion from character to integer.
- Edge cases to watch for: Strings with very large lengths or strings containing non-digit characters.
- Performance pitfalls: Using more complex data structures or algorithms than necessary.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with strings of varying lengths and digit compositions.
