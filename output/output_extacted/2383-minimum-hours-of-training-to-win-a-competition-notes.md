## Minimum Hours of Training to Win a Competition

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-hours-of-training-to-win-a-competition/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: You are given two arrays, `nums` and `multiplier`, where `nums` represents the scores of your friends in the competition and `multiplier` represents the multiplier values for each score.
- Input format and constraints: 
  - `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
  - `nums.length == multiplier.length`
  - `1 <= multiplier.length <= 1000`
  - `1 <= multiplier[i] <= 1000`
- Expected output format: The minimum hours of training required to win the competition.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The training process involves multiplying the score by a multiplier.
  - The goal is to find the minimum number of hours required to win the competition.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves checking all possible combinations of training hours and multipliers to find the minimum hours required to win the competition.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of training hours and multipliers.
  2. For each combination, calculate the total score.
  3. Compare the total score with the maximum score of the friends.
  4. If the total score is greater than the maximum score, update the minimum hours required.

```cpp
int minHours(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& multiplier) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxScore = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        maxScore = max(maxScore, nums[i]);
    }
    int minHours = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
        int totalScore = 0;
        int hours = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                totalScore += nums[j] * multiplier[j];
                hours++;
            }
        }
        if (totalScore > maxScore) {
            minHours = min(minHours, hours);
        }
    }
    return minHours;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \times n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input arrays. This is because we are generating all possible combinations of training hours and multipliers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking all possible combinations of training hours and multipliers, which leads to an exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a greedy approach to select the multipliers that result in the maximum score.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the multipliers in descending order.
  2. Initialize the total score and the minimum hours required.
  3. Iterate through the sorted multipliers and add the score to the total score if it is greater than the maximum score.
  4. Update the minimum hours required.

```cpp
int minHours(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& multiplier) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxScore = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        maxScore = max(maxScore, nums[i]);
    }
    int minHours = 0;
    sort(multiplier.rbegin(), multiplier.rend());
    int totalScore = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        totalScore += nums[i] * multiplier[i];
        minHours++;
        if (totalScore > maxScore) {
            break;
        }
    }
    return minHours;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input arrays. This is because we are sorting the multipliers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** The greedy approach ensures that we select the multipliers that result in the maximum score, which leads to the minimum hours required to win the competition.
