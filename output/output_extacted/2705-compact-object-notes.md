## Compact Binary Object Notation (CBOR) Object
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/compact-object/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: `vector<int>` representing the object's attributes.
- Constraints: Attributes are non-negative integers and the input vector is non-empty.
- Expected output format: The compact binary representation of the input object as a string.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling large integers and ensuring the output is a valid CBOR object.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Output: `"\x83\x01\x02\x03"`
  - Explanation: The input vector is represented as a CBOR array with three elements.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through the input vector and convert each integer to its binary representation.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty string to store the compact binary representation.
  2. Iterate through the input vector.
  3. For each integer, convert it to its binary representation and append it to the string.
  4. Prepend the string with the CBOR array length (in this case, the length of the input vector).
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to convert the input vector to a binary representation.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

std::string compactObject(const std::vector<int>& attributes) {
    std::string result;
    // Prepend the CBOR array length
    result += static_cast<char>(0x80 + attributes.size());
    
    // Iterate through the input vector and convert each integer to its binary representation
    for (const auto& attribute : attributes) {
        // Convert the integer to its binary representation
        uint8_t bytes[4];
        for (int i = 3; i >= 0; --i) {
            bytes[i] = attribute & 0xFF;
            attribute >>= 8;
        }
        
        // Append the binary representation to the string
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            if (bytes[i] != 0 || i == 3) {
                result += static_cast<char>(bytes[i]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the input vector and $m$ is the maximum number of bytes required to represent an integer in the vector.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the input vector and $m$ is the maximum number of bytes required to represent an integer in the vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach iterates through the input vector and converts each integer to its binary representation, resulting in a time and space complexity proportional to the length of the input vector and the maximum number of bytes required to represent an integer.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a more efficient method to convert integers to their binary representation, such as using bitwise operations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty string to store the compact binary representation.
  2. Iterate through the input vector.
  3. For each integer, use bitwise operations to convert it to its binary representation and append it to the string.
  4. Prepend the string with the CBOR array length (in this case, the length of the input vector).
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the input vector and $m$ is the maximum number of bytes required to represent an integer in the vector. This is the best possible time complexity for this problem, as we must iterate through the input vector and convert each integer to its binary representation.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cstdint>

std::string compactObject(const std::vector<int>& attributes) {
    std::string result;
    // Prepend the CBOR array length
    result += static_cast<char>(0x80 + attributes.size());
    
    // Iterate through the input vector and convert each integer to its binary representation
    for (const auto& attribute : attributes) {
        if (attribute < 24) {
            result += static_cast<char>(0x40 + attribute);
        } else if (attribute < 256) {
            result += static_cast<char>(0x40 + 24);
            result += static_cast<char>(attribute);
        } else if (attribute < 65536) {
            result += static_cast<char>(0x40 + 25);
            result += static_cast<char>(attribute & 0xFF);
            result += static_cast<char>((attribute >> 8) & 0xFF);
        } else {
            result += static_cast<char>(0x40 + 26);
            result += static_cast<char>(attribute & 0xFF);
            result += static_cast<char>((attribute >> 8) & 0xFF);
            result += static_cast<char>((attribute >> 16) & 0xFF);
            result += static_cast<char>((attribute >> 24) & 0xFF);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```
