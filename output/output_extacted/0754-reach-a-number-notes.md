## Reach a Number
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reach-a-number/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer `target`.
- Constraints: $-2^{31} \leq target \leq 2^{31}-1$.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of steps required to reach the `target` from 0.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling negative numbers, dealing with overflow, and understanding the pattern of reaching a target.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - Input: `target = 2`, Output: `3`. Explanation: Starting from 0, we need to take steps to reach the target. The steps can be positive or negative but must be consecutive integers. For `target = 2`, one possible sequence is: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2. The minimum number of steps is 3.
  - Input: `target = 3`, Output: `2`. Explanation: A possible sequence for `target = 3` is: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The minimum number of steps is 2.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of steps to reach the target and keep track of the minimum number of steps.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a queue with the starting point (0) and the number of steps (0).
  2. Dequeue the current position and the number of steps.
  3. For each possible next position (current position + next step or current position - next step), check if the new position is the target. If it is, return the number of steps plus one.
  4. If not, enqueue the new position and the updated number of steps.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to explore all possible paths and find the shortest one.

```cpp
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int reachNumber(int target) {
        queue<pair<int, int>> q; // {position, steps}
        q.push({0, 0});
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [pos, steps] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (pos == target) return steps;
            for (int i = 1; i <= steps + 1; ++i) {
                int nextPos = pos + i;
                if (nextPos == target) return steps + 1;
                q.push({nextPos, steps + 1});
                nextPos = pos - i;
                if (nextPos == target) return steps + 1;
                q.push({nextPos, steps + 1});
            }
        }
        return -1; // Should not reach here
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{target})$, because in the worst case, we might explore all possible combinations of steps up to the target.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^{target})$, as we store all intermediate positions in the queue.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach explores all possible paths without any optimization, leading to exponential time and space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a mathematical approach to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the target. The idea is to find the smallest `k` such that `k*(k+1)/2 >= abs(target)`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate `k` using the formula `k*(k+1)/2 >= abs(target)`.
  2. Check if the sum of the first `k` positive integers includes the target. If it does, return `k`.
  3. If not, find the remainder when `abs(target)` is subtracted from the sum of the first `k` positive integers. If the remainder is odd, we need one more step to reach the target.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses the mathematical property that the sum of the first `k` positive integers is `k*(k+1)/2`, which provides the minimum number of steps required to reach a target.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reachNumber(int target) {
        target = abs(target);
        int k = 0;
        while (k * (k + 1) / 2 < target) {
            k++;
        }
        while ((k * (k + 1) / 2 - target) % 2 != 0) {
            k++;
        }
        return k;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\sqrt{target})$, because we need to find the smallest `k` such that `k*(k+1)/2 >= abs(target)`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses the mathematical property to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the target, avoiding the need to explore all possible paths.
