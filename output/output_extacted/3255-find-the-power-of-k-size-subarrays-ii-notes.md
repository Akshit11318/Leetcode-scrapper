## Find the Power of K-Size Subarrays II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-power-of-k-size-subarrays-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an integer array `nums`, an integer `k`, and an integer `x`, return the number of subarrays of size `k` such that the product of all elements in the subarray is less than or equal to `x`.
- Expected output format: The number of valid subarrays.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The product of all elements in a subarray can exceed the maximum limit for an integer, so a data type that can handle larger numbers (like `long long` in C++) should be used. Also, consider cases where `x` is 0 or negative.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `nums = [1,2,3]`, `k = 2`, and `x = 6`, the function should return `3` because all subarrays of size `2` (`[1,2]`, `[2,3]`, and `[1,3]`) have a product less than or equal to `6`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The simplest approach is to generate all possible subarrays of size `k` from the given array `nums` and calculate the product of each subarray.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all subarrays of size `k`.
  2. For each subarray, calculate the product of its elements.
  3. Compare the product with `x` and count the subarrays where the product is less than or equal to `x`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; ++i) {
        long long product = 1;
        for (int j = i; j < i + k; ++j) {
            product *= nums[j];
            if (product > k) break; // Early termination if product exceeds k
        }
        if (product <= k) count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$ because for each starting position `i`, we potentially iterate `k` times to calculate the product.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store variables like `count` and `product`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach requires checking every possible subarray, leading to a time complexity that is linear in the number of subarrays and the size of each subarray. The space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that grow with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of recalculating the product for each subarray from scratch, we can use a sliding window approach. This involves maintaining a running product of the current window and adjusting it as we slide the window.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a window of size `k` starting from the beginning of `nums`.
  2. Calculate the product of the elements in the initial window.
  3. Slide the window one element to the right, dividing the current product by the element leaving the window and multiplying it by the new element entering the window.
  4. At each position, check if the current product is less than or equal to `k` and increment the count accordingly.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of multiplications and divisions required to calculate the product of each subarray, reducing the time complexity significantly.

```cpp
int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    if (k <= 1) return 0; // If k is less than or equal to 1, no subarray will have a product less than k
    int left = 0, product = 1, count = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); ++right) {
        product *= nums[right];
        while (product >= k && left <= right) {
            product /= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
        count += right - left + 1; // Count the number of valid subarrays ending at right
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ because each element in `nums` is visited at most twice (once by `right` and once by `left`).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store variables like `left`, `product`, and `count`.
> - **Optimality proof:** The sliding window approach minimizes the number of operations required to calculate the product of subarrays, making it the most efficient solution.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sliding window technique, optimization of calculations within loops.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a running product to efficiently calculate subarray products.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minimizing redundant calculations by adjusting a running product.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving subarray calculations or the sliding window technique.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling the boundaries of the sliding window or forgetting to update the running product.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `k` is less than or equal to 1 or where the product of a subarray exceeds the maximum limit for an integer.
- Performance pitfalls: Failing to optimize calculations within loops, leading to inefficient solutions.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
