## Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two strings `s` and `t`.
- Constraints: Both strings consist of lowercase English letters.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of steps required to make `s` and `t` anagrams of each other.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - If a character appears more times in `s` than in `t`, we need to remove it from `s`.
    - If a character appears more times in `t` than in `s`, we need to add it to `s`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - Input: `s = "leetcode", t = "practice"`
    - Output: `5`
    - Explanation: We need to remove `l`, `e`, `e` from `s` and add `p`, `r`, `a` to `s` to make `s` and `t` anagrams.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can try all possible combinations of removing and adding characters to `s` to make it an anagram of `t`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Generate all possible combinations of removing characters from `s`.
    2. For each combination, generate all possible combinations of adding characters to `s`.
    3. Check if the resulting string is an anagram of `t`.
    4. If it is, calculate the number of steps required to make the transformation.
    5. Keep track of the minimum number of steps required.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible combinations, but it is not efficient.

```cpp
int minSteps(string s, string t) {
    int res = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << s.size()); i++) {
        string temp = "";
        for (int j = 0; j < s.size(); j++) {
            if ((i & (1 << j)) == 0) {
                temp += s[j];
            }
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < (1 << t.size()); j++) {
            string temp2 = temp;
            for (int k = 0; k < t.size(); k++) {
                if ((j & (1 << k)) != 0) {
                    temp2 += t[k];
                }
            }
            if (isAnagram(temp2, t)) {
                int steps = __builtin_popcount(i) + __builtin_popcount(j);
                res = min(res, steps);
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}

bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
    sort(s.begin(), s.end());
    sort(t.begin(), t.end());
    return s == t;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \cdot log(n))$ where $n$ is the size of the string `s`. This is because we generate all possible combinations of removing characters from `s` and adding characters to `s`, and for each combination, we sort the resulting string to check if it is an anagram of `t`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the size of the string `s`. This is because we need to store the resulting string after removing and adding characters.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we try all possible combinations of removing and adding characters to `s`, and for each combination, we sort the resulting string to check if it is an anagram of `t`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a frequency count array to count the frequency of each character in `s` and `t`, and then calculate the difference in frequency counts to determine the minimum number of steps required.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Create two frequency count arrays, one for `s` and one for `t`.
    2. Calculate the difference in frequency counts for each character.
    3. The minimum number of steps required is the sum of the absolute values of the differences in frequency counts.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of steps required to make `s` and `t` anagrams, without trying all possible combinations.

```cpp
int minSteps(string s, string t) {
    int count[26] = {0};
    for (char c : s) {
        count[c - 'a']++;
    }
    for (char c : t) {
        count[c - 'a']--;
    }
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        res += abs(count[i]);
    }
    return res;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the size of the string `s`. This is because we iterate through each character in `s` and `t` to calculate the frequency counts.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we use a fixed-size frequency count array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of steps required to make `s` and `t` anagrams, without trying all possible combinations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Frequency count arrays, difference in frequency counts.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using frequency count arrays to solve anagram-related problems.
- Optimization techniques learned: Directly calculating the minimum number of steps required instead of trying all possible combinations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other anagram-related problems, such as finding the minimum number of steps to make two strings anagrams with a given constraint.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the frequency count array, not iterating through each character in `s` and `t`.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty strings, strings with different lengths.
- Performance pitfalls: Trying all possible combinations instead of directly calculating the minimum number of steps required.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different input cases, such as strings with different lengths, empty strings, and strings with the same length but different characters.
