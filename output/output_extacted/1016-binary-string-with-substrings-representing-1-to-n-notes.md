## Binary String With Substrings Representing 1 To N
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-string-with-substrings-representing-1-to-n/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a binary string `s` and an integer `n`, determine if there exists a binary string `t` of length `n` where every number from `1` to `n` can be represented as a substring of `t`.
- Expected output format: A boolean value indicating whether such a binary string `t` exists.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The binary string `t` should be able to represent all integers from `1` to `n` as substrings, and the length of `t` should be `n`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `s = "0110"`, `n = 3`, Output: `True`, Explanation: `"0110"` itself has all the numbers that are less than or equal to `3`.
  - Example 2: Input: `s = "0110"`, `n = 4`, Output: `False`, Explanation: We can't find a length `4` binary string from `"0110"`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach is to generate all possible binary strings of length `n` and check each one to see if it contains all numbers from `1` to `n` as substrings.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible binary strings of length `n`.
  2. For each binary string, check if it contains all numbers from `1` to `n` as substrings.
  3. If a binary string is found that meets the condition, return `True`.
  4. If no such binary string is found after checking all possibilities, return `False`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive approach that ensures all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool isPossible(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        string binary = "";
        int temp = i;
        while (temp > 0) {
            binary = (temp % 2 == 0 ? "0" : "1") + binary;
            temp /= 2;
        }
        if (binary.length() > n) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << boolalpha << isPossible(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because we generate all possible binary strings of length `n` (which is $2^n$) and then for each string, we perform a check that takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store the generated binary strings, which in the worst case can be of length `n`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because of the brute force nature of the algorithm, which involves generating all possible binary strings and then performing a check on each one.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight here is to realize that we don't need to generate all possible binary strings. Instead, we can directly check if the given string `s` or a possible binary string `t` of length `n` can represent all numbers from `1` to `n` as substrings. This is because the problem doesn't require us to find such a string `t` explicitly but rather to determine if it's possible.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Check if the length of `s` is sufficient to represent all numbers from `1` to `n`.
  2. Iterate over all numbers from `1` to `n`, convert each number to binary, and check if this binary representation is a substring of `s`.
  3. If any number's binary representation is not found in `s`, we can conclude that it's not possible to find a binary string `t` of length `n` that meets the condition.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly addresses the problem statement without unnecessary steps. It checks the feasibility of representing all numbers from `1` to `n` as substrings in a given or possible binary string, which is the core requirement of the problem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool queryString(string s, int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        string binary = "";
        int temp = i;
        while (temp > 0) {
            binary = (temp % 2 == 0 ? "0" : "1") + binary;
            temp /= 2;
        }
        if (s.find(binary) == string::npos) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    int n;
    cin >> s >> n;
    cout << boolalpha << queryString(s, n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot log(n))$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because we iterate over all numbers from `1` to `n`, and for each number, we convert it to binary (which takes $O(log(n))$ time) and perform a substring search in `s` (which takes $O(n)$ time in the worst case).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(log(n))$, as we need to store the binary representation of each number, which in the worst case can be of length $log(n)$.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly checks the condition specified in the problem without generating unnecessary binary strings, thus minimizing the time and space complexity.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Substring searching, binary representation of numbers, and optimization of brute force approaches.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Looking for patterns or properties of the input that can reduce the search space.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary computations by directly checking the feasibility of the solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving substring searching, binary representations, and optimization.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect handling of edge cases, such as when `n` is very large or when the input string `s` is empty.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `n` is larger than the length of `s`, or when `s` does not contain any binary representations of numbers from `1` to `n`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using brute force approaches without considering optimizations, leading to high time and space complexities.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness and efficiency.
