## Minimum Total Space Wasted with K Resizing Operations

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-space-wasted-with-k-resizing-operations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes a list of files of different sizes and an integer `k` as input, where `k` is the number of resizing operations allowed.
- Expected output format: The minimum total space wasted after `k` resizing operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The total space wasted is the sum of the differences between the actual size of each file and the size of the partition it is stored in.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given a list of files `[10, 20, 30]` and `k = 1`, the minimum total space wasted can be achieved by resizing the partition to `30`, resulting in a total space wasted of `10 + 20 = 30`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible combinations of partition sizes for each file and calculating the total space wasted for each combination.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of partition sizes for each file.
  2. For each combination, calculate the total space wasted by summing the differences between the actual size of each file and the size of the partition it is stored in.
  3. Keep track of the minimum total space wasted found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is often the first approach that comes to mind because it is straightforward and easy to understand.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minSpaceWastedKResizing(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxVal = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all possible combinations of partition sizes for each file
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        int count = __builtin_popcount(mask);
        if (count > k) continue;
        
        vector<int> sizes;
        int start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                int maxInPartition = *max_element(nums.begin() + start, nums.begin() + i + 1);
                sizes.push_back(maxInPartition);
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }
        if (start < n) {
            int maxInPartition = *max_element(nums.begin() + start, nums.end());
            sizes.push_back(maxInPartition);
        }
        
        // Calculate the total space wasted for the current combination
        int totalSpaceWasted = 0;
        int index = 0;
        for (int size : sizes) {
            while (index < n && nums[index] <= size) {
                totalSpaceWasted += size - nums[index];
                index++;
            }
        }
        
        // Update the minimum total space wasted
        maxVal = min(maxVal, totalSpaceWasted);
    }
    
    return maxVal;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of files. This is because we generate all possible combinations of partition sizes for each file, which takes $O(2^n)$ time, and for each combination, we calculate the total space wasted, which takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of files. This is because we need to store the current combination of partition sizes, which takes $O(n)$ space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time and space complexities because it generates all possible combinations of partition sizes for each file and calculates the total space wasted for each combination.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using dynamic programming to calculate the minimum total space wasted for each possible number of partitions.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum total space wasted for the first `i` files with `j` partitions.
  2. For each file, calculate the minimum total space wasted for each possible number of partitions by considering all possible previous partitions.
  3. Use the `dp` array to calculate the minimum total space wasted for the entire list of files with `k` partitions.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of partition sizes for each file and calculate the minimum total space wasted for each combination.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minSpaceWastedKResizing(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, INT_MAX));
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= min(i, k); j++) {
            int totalSpaceWasted = 0;
            for (int m = i - 1; m >= 0; m--) {
                totalSpaceWasted += nums[i - 1] - nums[m];
                if (m == 0 || j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], totalSpaceWasted + (m == 0 ? 0 : dp[m][j - 1]));
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], totalSpaceWasted + dp[m][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][k];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of files and $k$ is the number of partitions. This is because we use a 2D array to store the minimum total space wasted for each possible number of partitions, and we calculate the minimum total space wasted for each combination.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of files and $k$ is the number of partitions. This is because we need to store the `dp` array, which takes $O(n \cdot k)$ space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of partition sizes for each file and calculate the minimum total space wasted for each combination, resulting in the optimal solution.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, partitioning.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach by considering all possible combinations of partition sizes for each file.
- Optimization techniques learned: The dynamic programming approach allows us to optimize the solution by avoiding redundant calculations and considering all possible combinations of partition sizes.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` array correctly, not considering all possible combinations of partition sizes for each file.
- Edge cases to watch for: The number of files and the number of partitions should be handled correctly, especially when they are equal to 0 or 1.
- Performance pitfalls: The brute force approach has high time and space complexities, and the dynamic programming approach should be used to optimize the solution.
- Testing considerations: The solution should be tested with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
