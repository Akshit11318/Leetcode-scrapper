## Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-area-to-cover-all-ones-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A 2D binary matrix `grid` where `grid[i][j]` can be either 0 or 1.
- Constraints: The input matrix `grid` will have dimensions `m x n` where `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`, and each cell `grid[i][j]` will be either 0 or 1.
- Expected Output: The minimum area to cover all ones in the matrix.
- Key Requirements: The area to cover all ones is defined as the minimum number of rows and columns that must be selected to cover all cells containing 1.
- Edge Cases: If no cells contain 1, the minimum area is 0.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible combination of rows and columns to find the minimum area that covers all ones.
- This approach involves iterating over all possible subsets of rows and columns, then for each subset, checking if it covers all cells containing 1.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem by considering all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int minArea(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int m, int n) {
    int min_area = INT_MAX;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << m); ++mask) {
        for (int col_mask = 0; col_mask < (1 << n); ++col_mask) {
            bool covers_all = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    if (grid[i][j] == 1 && !(mask & (1 << i)) && !(col_mask & (1 << j))) {
                        covers_all = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!covers_all) break;
            }
            if (covers_all) {
                int area = __builtin_popcount(mask) + __builtin_popcount(col_mask);
                min_area = min(min_area, area);
            }
        }
    }
    return min_area == INT_MAX ? 0 : min_area;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^m \cdot 2^n \cdot m \cdot n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the input matrix. This is because we are iterating over all possible subsets of rows and columns and then checking each cell in the matrix for each subset.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not including the space needed for the input matrix, as we only use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The exponential time complexity occurs because we are generating all possible subsets of rows and columns, which is $2^m$ and $2^n$ respectively. Then, for each subset, we check every cell in the matrix, leading to the $m \cdot n$ factor.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal solution involves understanding that the minimum area to cover all ones is equivalent to finding the minimum number of rows and columns that must be selected.
- We can use a greedy approach to select rows and columns that cover the most uncovered cells containing 1 at each step.
- This approach is optimal because it ensures that we are always making the locally optimal choice, which leads to the global optimum.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int minArea(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int m, int n) {
    vector<int> row_count(m, 0), col_count(n, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                row_count[i]++;
                col_count[j]++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    int min_area = m + n;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << m); ++mask) {
        int row_sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            if (mask & (1 << i)) row_sum += row_count[i];
        }
        int col_sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            bool covered = false;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && (mask & (1 << i))) {
                    covered = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!covered) col_sum += col_count[j];
        }
        min_area = min(min_area, row_sum + col_sum);
    }
    return min_area;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m + n)$, for storing the count of ones in each row and column.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it considers all possible subsets of rows and for each subset, it calculates the minimum number of columns needed to cover all remaining ones, thus ensuring the minimum area.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of understanding the problem constraints and how they impact the solution.
- The use of bitwise operations to efficiently generate subsets.
- The application of greedy principles to achieve optimality.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering all possible subsets of rows and columns.
- Not correctly calculating the minimum area for each subset.
- Not optimizing the solution for the given constraints.
