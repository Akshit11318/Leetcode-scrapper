## Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-a-good-subsequence-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two strings `text1` and `text2`.
- Constraints: `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`.
- Expected Output: The length of the longest common subsequence of `text1` and `text2`.
- Key Requirements: Find the maximum length of a good subsequence, which is a subsequence that appears in the same order in both strings.
- Edge Cases: Empty strings, strings with no common characters, strings with repeated characters.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"`: The longest common subsequence is "ace" with a length of 3.
- `text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"`: The longest common subsequence is "" with a length of 0.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to generate all possible subsequences of `text1` and `text2` and check if they are common.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible subsequences of `text1`.
  2. For each subsequence of `text1`, check if it is a subsequence of `text2`.
  3. Keep track of the maximum length of the common subsequences found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that checks all possibilities.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxUncrossedLines(string text1, string text2) {
        int m = text1.size();
        int n = text2.size();
        int maxLen = 0;
        
        // Generate all possible subsequences of text1
        for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << m); mask++) {
            string subseq;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    subseq += text1[i];
                }
            }
            
            // Check if the subsequence is a subsequence of text2
            int j = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (j < subseq.size() && text2[i] == subseq[j]) {
                    j++;
                }
            }
            
            // Update the maximum length if the subsequence is common
            if (j == subseq.size()) {
                maxLen = max(maxLen, (int)subseq.size());
            }
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^m \cdot n \cdot m)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the lengths of `text1` and `text2`, respectively. The reason is that we generate all possible subsequences of `text1` (which takes $O(2^m)$ time) and for each subsequence, we check if it is a subsequence of `text2` (which takes $O(n \cdot m)$ time).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the length of `text1`. The reason is that we need to store the current subsequence of `text1`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we generate all possible subsequences of `text1` and check if they are common with `text2`. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the current subsequence of `text1`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can use dynamic programming to build up the solution. We create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of the first `i` characters of `text1` and the first `j` characters of `text2`.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize the `dp` array with zeros.
  2. For each character in `text1` and `text2`, check if they are equal.
  3. If they are equal, update `dp[i][j]` to be `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
  4. If they are not equal, update `dp[i][j]` to be the maximum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses dynamic programming to build up the solution, which avoids redundant computations and reduces the time complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxUncrossedLines(string text1, string text2) {
        int m = text1.size();
        int n = text2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```
