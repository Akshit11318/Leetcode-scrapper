## Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal Indromic
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-array-equalindromic/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an array of integers `arr` with a length of `n`, where `n` is an even number. The goal is to find the minimum cost to make the array equal to its reverse (`arr` is equal to its reverse if `arr[i] == arr[n - i - 1]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`).
- Expected output format: The minimum cost to make the array equal to its reverse.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The cost of making two elements equal is the absolute difference between the two elements. The array can be modified in-place.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For the input `[1, 4, 2, 4]`, the output is `1` because we can change the second element to be equal to the third element, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`.
  - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output is `6` because we need to change the second element to be equal to the third element, and the first element to be equal to the fourth element, resulting in the array `[4, 3, 3, 4]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can start by comparing each pair of elements from the start and end of the array and calculate the cost of making them equal.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `cost` to store the total cost.
  2. Iterate over the array from the start and end using two pointers `i` and `j`.
  3. For each pair of elements, calculate the cost of making them equal by taking the absolute difference between the two elements.
  4. Add the cost to the total cost.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it may not be the most efficient solution.

```cpp
int minCost(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int cost = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
        int j = n - i - 1;
        cost += abs(arr[i] - arr[j]);
    }
    return cost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array, because we are iterating over the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the cost.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are iterating over the array once, and the space complexity is constant because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the cost.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is to calculate the cost of making each pair of elements equal and return the total cost.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable `cost` to store the total cost.
  2. Iterate over the array from the start and end using two pointers `i` and `j`.
  3. For each pair of elements, calculate the cost of making them equal by taking the absolute difference between the two elements.
  4. Add the cost to the total cost.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it calculates the minimum cost to make the array equal to its reverse by comparing each pair of elements and taking the absolute difference between them.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This solution is already optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the minimum time complexity required to iterate over the array.

```cpp
int minCost(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int cost = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
        int j = n - i - 1;
        cost += abs(arr[i] - arr[j]);
    }
    return cost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array, because we are iterating over the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the cost.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it calculates the minimum cost to make the array equal to its reverse by comparing each pair of elements and taking the absolute difference between them.
