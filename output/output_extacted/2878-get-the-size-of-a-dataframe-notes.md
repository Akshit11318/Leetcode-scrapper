## Get the Size of a DataFrame
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/get-the-size-of-a-dataframe/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a DataFrame, return the number of rows and columns.
- Expected output format: Return a vector of two integers, where the first integer is the number of rows and the second integer is the number of columns.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The DataFrame can be empty, and we need to handle this case.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`, Output: `[2, 3]`
  - Input: `[]`, Output: `[0, 0]`

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We need to find the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Check if the DataFrame is empty. If it is, return `[0, 0]`.
  2. Otherwise, find the number of rows by checking the size of the DataFrame.
  3. Find the number of columns by checking the size of the first row.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and simple approach.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> get_size(vector<vector<int>>& df) {
    if (df.empty()) {
        return {0, 0};
    }
    int rows = df.size();
    int cols = df[0].size();
    return {rows, cols};
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only access the size of the DataFrame and the size of the first row.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the result.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is constant because we only perform a constant number of operations. The space complexity is constant because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can directly access the size of the DataFrame and the size of the first row.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Check if the DataFrame is empty. If it is, return `[0, 0]`.
  2. Otherwise, find the number of rows by checking the size of the DataFrame.
  3. Find the number of columns by checking the size of the first row.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(1)$ and a space complexity of $O(1)$.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> get_size(vector<vector<int>>& df) {
    if (df.empty()) {
        return {0, 0};
    }
    int rows = df.size();
    int cols = df[0].size();
    return {rows, cols};
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Directly accessing the size of a DataFrame and the size of the first row.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking for edge cases and using constant time and space complexity.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using built-in functions to access the size of a DataFrame and the size of the first row.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the size of a matrix, finding the number of rows and columns in a 2D array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, using unnecessary loops or recursive calls.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty DataFrames, DataFrames with no rows or columns.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary loops or recursive calls, not using built-in functions to access the size of a DataFrame and the size of the first row.
- Testing considerations: Testing with empty DataFrames, DataFrames with no rows or columns, and DataFrames with different numbers of rows and columns.
