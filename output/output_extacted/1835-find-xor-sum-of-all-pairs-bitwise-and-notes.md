## Find XOR Sum of All Pairs Bitwise AND
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-xor-sum-of-all-pairs-bitwise-and/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` of length `n`, find the XOR sum of all pairs of elements where each element is the bitwise AND of an element from `arr1` and an element from `arr2`.
- Expected output format: A single integer representing the XOR sum.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where `n` is large, ensuring the XOR operation is performed correctly.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if `arr1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `arr2 = [6, 5]`, the bitwise AND of all pairs are `[1, 0, 1]` and `[0, 2, 1]`, then the XOR sum is `0 XOR 3 = 3`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over all pairs of elements from `arr1` and `arr2`, compute the bitwise AND for each pair, then compute the XOR of all these bitwise AND results.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the XOR sum.
  2. Iterate over each element in `arr1`.
  3. For each element in `arr1`, iterate over each element in `arr2`.
  4. Compute the bitwise AND of the current elements from `arr1` and `arr2`.
  5. Update the XOR sum by XORing it with the bitwise AND result.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows from the problem statement and is the most straightforward way to ensure all pairs are considered.

```cpp
int getXORSum(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2) {
    int xorSum = 0;
    for (int num1 : arr1) {
        for (int num2 : arr2) {
            xorSum ^= (num1 & num2);
        }
    }
    return xorSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input arrays, because we are iterating over all pairs of elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input arrays, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the XOR sum.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The nested loops over the input arrays cause the quadratic time complexity, while the constant space complexity is due to only using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Notice that the XOR operation has the property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. This means that if we can find a way to pair up the bitwise AND results such that each pair consists of the same number, these pairs will cancel each other out when XORed together.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Compute the XOR of all elements in `arr1` and `arr2` separately.
  2. The XOR sum of all pairs of bitwise ANDs can be simplified using the properties of XOR and bitwise AND operations.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it reduces the problem to a simple XOR operation on the input arrays, avoiding the need for explicit iteration over all pairs.

```cpp
int getXORSum(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2) {
    int xor1 = 0, xor2 = 0;
    for (int num : arr1) xor1 ^= num;
    for (int num : arr2) xor2 ^= num;
    return xor1 & xor2;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total length of the input arrays, because we are making a single pass through each array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the XOR sums of `arr1` and `arr2`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because any algorithm must at least read the input, and we do so in linear time while using constant extra space.
