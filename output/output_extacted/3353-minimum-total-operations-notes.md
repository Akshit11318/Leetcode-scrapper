## Minimum Total Operations
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-operations/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-operations/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a string `word` of length $n$, we want to transform it into a new string where all the letters are in ascending order (i.e., `a` comes before `b`, `b` comes before `c`, and so on). We can perform two types of operations:
  - **Insert**: Insert a character into the string.
  - **Delete**: Delete a character from the string.
  - **Replace**: Replace a character in the string with another character.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, and replacements) needed to transform the string into an ascending order string.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The string only contains lowercase English letters. We should consider the optimal way to perform these operations to minimize the total count.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - Input: `word = "cba"`
    - Output: `5`
    - Explanation: We can transform the string into an ascending order string by performing the following operations:
      - Delete `c`, `b`, and `a`.
      - Insert `a`, `b`, and `c` in the correct order.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can use a brute force approach by generating all possible strings of the same length as the input string, sorting each string, and then calculating the minimum number of operations needed to transform the input string into each sorted string.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible strings of the same length as the input string.
  2. For each generated string, sort it in ascending order.
  3. Calculate the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, and replacements) needed to transform the input string into each sorted string.
  4. Return the minimum number of operations among all the calculated values.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that considers all possible outcomes, but it's inefficient due to the large number of possible strings.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minOperations(std::string word) {
    int n = word.size();
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all possible strings of the same length as the input string
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << 26); mask++) {
        std::string generatedString;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                    generatedString += (char)('a' + j);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Sort the generated string
        std::sort(generatedString.begin(), generatedString.end());
        
        // Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to transform the input string into the sorted string
        int ops = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (word[i] != generatedString[i]) {
                ops++;
            }
        }
        
        // Update the minimum number of operations
        minOps = std::min(minOps, ops);
    }
    
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{26} \cdot n^2 \cdot \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string. The time complexity is dominated by the generation of all possible strings and the sorting of each string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string. The space complexity is dominated by the storage of the generated strings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates an exponential number of possible strings, and for each string, it performs a sorting operation, resulting in a high time complexity. The space complexity is relatively low since we only need to store the generated strings.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to transform the input string into an ascending order string.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` of size $n \times 26$, where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum number of operations needed to transform the first $i$ characters of the input string into an ascending order string ending with the character `j`.
  2. Fill the dynamic programming table using the following recurrence relation:
    - $dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i-1][k] + (word[i-1] != 'a' + j-1))$, where $k$ ranges from `0` to `j`.
  3. The minimum number of operations is stored in the last cell of the dynamic programming table, i.e., `dp[n-1][25]`.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach considers all possible transformations of the input string into an ascending order string and returns the minimum number of operations. The recurrence relation ensures that we consider all possible previous transformations and choose the one that results in the minimum number of operations.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot 26^2)$, which is optimal since we need to consider all possible transformations of the input string.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minOperations(std::string word) {
    int n = word.size();
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n, std::vector<int>(26, INT_MAX));
    
    // Initialize the base case
    for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = (word[0] != 'a' + j);
    }
    
    // Fill the dynamic programming table
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k <= j; k++) {
                dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + (word[i] != 'a' + j));
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Return the minimum number of operations
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
        minOps = std::min(minOps, dp[n-1][j]);
    }
    
    return minOps;
}
```

- Edge cases to watch for: Handling empty strings, strings with a single character, and strings with duplicate characters.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures, such as recursive functions or nested loops, and failing to optimize the solution for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different inputs, including edge cases, and verifying the correctness of the output.
