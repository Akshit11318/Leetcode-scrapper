## Longest Non-Decreasing Subarray from Two Arrays

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-non-decreasing-subarray-from-two-arrays/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of integers, find the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray that can be formed by taking elements from either `nums1` or `nums2`.
- Expected output format: Return the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Both arrays are non-empty and contain at least one element. The arrays can contain duplicate elements.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 7], nums2 = [2, 3, 6, 7]`, Output: `4`
  - Example 2: `nums1 = [1, 2, 3], nums2 = [4, 5, 6]`, Output: `3`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible subarrays from both `nums1` and `nums2`, then check each subarray to see if it is non-decreasing.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subarrays from `nums1` and `nums2`.
  2. For each subarray, check if it is non-decreasing by comparing each element with its next element.
  3. Keep track of the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most straightforward way to solve the problem, but it is inefficient due to its high time complexity.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findLength(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
    int maxLen = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < nums2.size(); j++) {
            int len = 0;
            int idx1 = i, idx2 = j;
            while (idx1 < nums1.size() || idx2 < nums2.size()) {
                if (idx1 < nums1.size() && (idx2 == nums2.size() || nums1[idx1] <= nums2[idx2])) {
                    len++;
                    idx1++;
                } else if (idx2 < nums2.size()) {
                    len++;
                    idx2++;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            maxLen = std::max(maxLen, len);
        }
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot (n + m))$ where $n$ and $m$ are the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. This is because for each pair of starting indices, we potentially iterate through the rest of both arrays.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum length and indices.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops to generate all possible subarrays and then check each one, resulting in high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use dynamic programming to store the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray ending at each position in both arrays.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize two arrays `dp1` and `dp2` to store the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray ending at each position in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
  2. Iterate through both arrays, updating `dp1` and `dp2` based on whether the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element.
  3. Keep track of the maximum length found so far.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that we only need to iterate through each array once, resulting in a significant reduction in time complexity.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findLength(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
    int maxLen = 0;
    std::vector<int> dp1(nums1.size(), 1);
    std::vector<int> dp2(nums2.size(), 1);
    
    for (int i = 1; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
        if (nums1[i] >= nums1[i - 1]) {
            dp1[i] = dp1[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i < nums2.size(); i++) {
        if (nums2[i] >= nums2[i - 1]) {
            dp2[i] = dp2[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < nums2.size(); j++) {
            if (nums1[i] == nums2[j]) {
                maxLen = std::max(maxLen, dp1[i] + dp2[j] - 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxLen;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ where $n$ and $m$ are the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. This is because we iterate through each array once to update `dp1` and `dp2`, and then iterate through both arrays again to find the maximum length.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ as we use two arrays `dp1` and `dp2` to store the lengths of the longest non-decreasing subarrays.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it reduces the time complexity from $O(n \cdot m \cdot (n + m))$ to $O(n \cdot m)$, which is the minimum required to find the maximum length.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, iteration through arrays, and comparison of elements.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using dynamic programming to store intermediate results and reduce time complexity.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing time complexity by iterating through arrays only once and using dynamic programming to store intermediate results.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the longest common subsequence, the longest increasing subsequence, and the minimum window substring.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect initialization of dynamic programming arrays, incorrect updating of dynamic programming arrays, and incorrect comparison of elements.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty arrays, arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays with negative elements.
- Performance pitfalls: High time complexity due to nested loops, and high space complexity due to unnecessary storage of intermediate results.
- Testing considerations: Test cases with different input sizes, test cases with different input values, and test cases with edge cases.
