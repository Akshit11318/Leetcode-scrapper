## Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-value-to-get-positive-step-by-step-sum/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: The length of `nums` is in the range $[1, 1000]$ and $-1000 \leq nums[i] \leq 1000$.
- Expected Output: The minimum value that needs to be added to the array such that the sum of the array elements is positive.
- Key Requirements: The sum of the array elements should be positive after adding the minimum value.
- Edge Cases: If the array sum is already positive, return 0. If the array sum is negative, return the absolute value of the sum plus one.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the sum of the array elements. If the sum is negative, add the absolute value of the sum plus one to the array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Calculate the sum of the array elements.
  2. Check if the sum is negative.
  3. If the sum is negative, return the absolute value of the sum plus one.
  4. If the sum is not negative, return 0.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by calculating the sum and adjusting it to be positive.

```cpp
int minStartValue(vector<int>& nums) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        sum += num;
    }
    if (sum < 0) {
        return abs(sum) + 1;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, because we need to iterate over the array once to calculate the sum.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we iterate over the array once, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can calculate the minimum prefix sum and return the absolute value of the minimum prefix sum plus one if it is negative.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the minimum prefix sum to 0.
  2. Initialize the current prefix sum to 0.
  3. Iterate over the array and update the current prefix sum.
  4. Update the minimum prefix sum if the current prefix sum is less than the minimum prefix sum.
  5. Return the absolute value of the minimum prefix sum plus one if it is negative.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the array and uses a constant amount of space.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We must iterate over the array at least once to calculate the minimum prefix sum, so the time complexity cannot be improved.

```cpp
int minStartValue(vector<int>& nums) {
    int minPrefixSum = 0;
    int currentPrefixSum = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        currentPrefixSum += num;
        minPrefixSum = min(minPrefixSum, currentPrefixSum);
    }
    if (minPrefixSum < 0) {
        return abs(minPrefixSum) + 1;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the array and uses a constant amount of space.
