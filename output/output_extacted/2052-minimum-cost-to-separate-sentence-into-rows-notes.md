## Minimum Cost to Separate Sentence into Rows
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-separate-sentence-into-rows/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `sentence` and an integer `rows`.
- Constraints: The length of `sentence` will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`, and `rows` will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Expected Output: The minimum cost to separate the sentence into rows.
- Key Requirements: 
  - Each row can have at most `k` characters.
  - If a word cannot fit in a row, it must be moved to the next row.
  - The cost of the last row is its length squared, and the cost of all other rows is the difference between the row's length and `k` squared.
- Edge Cases: 
  - Handling words longer than `k`.
  - Handling empty strings or `rows` being 1.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves iterating through the sentence and checking each word to see if it can fit in the current row.
- We then calculate the cost of each row based on its length and the given `k`.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement by simulating the process of filling rows.

```cpp
int minCost(vector<string>& words, int k) {
    int rows = 1, length = 0, cost = 0;
    for (string word : words) {
        if (length + word.length() + 1 <= k) {
            length += word.length() + 1;
        } else {
            cost += (k - length) * (k - length);
            length = word.length();
            rows++;
        }
    }
    cost += (k - length) * (k - length);
    return cost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of words, because we process each word once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the words, but the algorithm itself uses constant space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The algorithm iterates through the list of words once, resulting in linear time complexity. The space complexity is due to the input storage.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a dynamic programming approach, but the problem can be solved more straightforwardly with a greedy algorithm that keeps track of the current row length and updates the cost accordingly.
- This approach is optimal because it processes each word exactly once and makes the optimal decision at each step based on the current state (the length of the current row).
- Further optimization is impossible because we must consider each word at least once to determine the optimal arrangement.

```cpp
int minCost(vector<string>& words, int k) {
    int rows = 1, length = 0, cost = 0;
    for (string word : words) {
        if (length + word.length() + 1 <= k) {
            length += word.length() + 1;
        } else {
            cost += (k - length) * (k - length);
            length = word.length();
            rows++;
        }
    }
    cost += (k - length) * (k - length);
    return cost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of words.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the current row length and the total cost.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the best possible complexity because we must at least read the input once to solve the problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy algorithms and dynamic programming are not always necessary; sometimes, a straightforward iterative approach is optimal.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The importance of understanding the problem constraints and identifying the minimal operations needed to solve the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary computations by making decisions based on the current state.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving text processing and optimization, such as word wrapping and text justification.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to handle edge cases, such as words longer than `k` or an empty input string.
- Edge cases to watch for: Always consider the boundaries of the problem, such as the minimum and maximum values of the input parameters.
- Performance pitfalls: Unnecessary iterations or computations can significantly impact performance.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly test the solution with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness and robustness.
