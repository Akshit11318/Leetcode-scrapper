## Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/words-within-two-edits-of-dictionary/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given a list of strings `wordlist` and a target string `target`.
- Constraints: All the strings in the `wordlist` and the `target` are only composed of lowercase letters from the English alphabet.
- Expected output format: Return all the strings from the `wordlist` that are within two edits of the `target`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The `wordlist` and `target` may contain duplicate strings. We should return all unique strings that meet the condition.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `wordlist = ["word1","word2","word3"], target = "word"` should return `["word1","word2","word3"]` if all are within two edits.
  - Example 2: `wordlist = ["word1","word2","word3"], target = "different"` should return an empty list if none are within two edits.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward way to solve this is to compare each word in the `wordlist` with the `target` and count the number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to transform the word into the `target`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Define a function to calculate the edit distance between two strings.
  2. Iterate over each word in the `wordlist`.
  3. For each word, calculate the edit distance to the `target`.
  4. If the edit distance is less than or equal to 2, add the word to the result list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, intuitive method that directly addresses the problem statement without requiring complex optimizations or insights.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int editDistance(const std::string& word1, const std::string& word2) {
    int m = word1.size(), n = word2.size();
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m + 1, std::vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i) {
        dp[i][0] = i;
    }
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j) {
        dp[0][j] = j;
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = 1 + std::min({dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]});
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n];
}

std::vector<std::string> twoEditWords(std::vector<std::string>& wordlist, const std::string& target) {
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    for (const auto& word : wordlist) {
        if (editDistance(word, target) <= 2) {
            result.push_back(word);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N \cdot M \cdot L)$, where $N$ is the number of words in the `wordlist`, $M$ is the maximum length of a word in the `wordlist`, and $L$ is the length of the `target`. This is because for each word, we calculate the edit distance, which takes $O(M \cdot L)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N \cdot M)$, for storing the result and the dynamic programming table for edit distance calculation.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves a straightforward iteration over all words and calculation of edit distance for each, leading to these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The current brute force approach is already quite optimal for this problem as it directly calculates the edit distance for each word in the list. However, we can slightly optimize by using a more efficient algorithm for calculating the edit distance, such as using a single loop instead of dynamic programming for each comparison, but this would not change the overall time complexity significantly.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The approach remains similar to the brute force, with the optimization being in how we calculate the edit distance or possibly in how we filter words before calculating the edit distance.
- Proof of optimality: Given the nature of the problem, which requires comparing each word in the list to the target, the optimal solution must involve at least one comparison per word. Thus, the time complexity cannot be less than $O(N \cdot M \cdot L)$, assuming $M$ and $L$ are the lengths of the words and the target, respectively.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Without additional information or constraints on the input, further optimization in terms of reducing the time complexity is not feasible.

```cpp
// The code provided in the brute force section is already optimal for this problem.
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N \cdot M)$, for storing the result and any additional data structures used.
> - **Optimality proof:** The problem inherently requires comparing each word to the target, making the $O(N \cdot M \cdot L)$ time complexity optimal for this approach.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Edit distance calculation, dynamic programming.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct comparison and filtering.
- Optimization techniques learned: None beyond the basic approach due to the nature of the problem.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string comparison and manipulation problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating edit distance, not handling edge cases (e.g., empty strings).
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty strings, strings of significantly different lengths.
- Performance pitfalls: Using overly complex algorithms for edit distance calculation.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and large inputs to verify performance.
