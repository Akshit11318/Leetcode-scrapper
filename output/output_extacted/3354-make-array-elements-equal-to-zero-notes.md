## Make Array Elements Equal to Zero
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/make-array-elements-equal-to-zero/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given an integer array `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`, `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal to zero.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array can contain duplicate elements, and the goal is to find the minimum number of operations to make all elements equal to zero.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `nums = [1,5,0,3,15]`, Output: `3`. Explanation: We can make all elements equal to zero in three operations: `nums[0] -= 1`, `nums[4] -= 15`, and then `nums[1] -= 5`, `nums[2] -= 0`, `nums[3] -= 3`.
  - Example 2: Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`, Output: `0`. Explanation: The array already contains all zeros, so no operations are needed.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible combinations of operations to make each element equal to zero.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `minOperations` to store the minimum number of operations required.
  2. Iterate over each element in the array.
  3. For each element, calculate the number of operations required to make it equal to zero by dividing the element's value by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the element's value and the maximum possible value in the array.
  4. Update `minOperations` with the minimum number of operations found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and involves iterating over each element in the array to calculate the minimum number of operations required.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int minOperations = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num != 0) {
            minOperations++;
        }
    }
    return minOperations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we iterate over each element in the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, which means the space required does not change with the size of the input array, making it constant.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a single pass through the array, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the `minOperations` variable.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves recognizing that the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to zero is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the array.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable `minOperations` to store the minimum number of operations required.
  2. Iterate over each element in the array.
  3. If the element is non-zero, increment `minOperations`.
  4. Return `minOperations` as the minimum number of operations required.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly counts the number of non-zero elements, which is the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to zero.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem because we must examine each element at least once.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int minOperations = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num != 0) {
            minOperations++;
        }
    }
    return minOperations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, which means the space required does not change with the size of the input array, making it constant.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly counts the number of non-zero elements, which is the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to zero.
