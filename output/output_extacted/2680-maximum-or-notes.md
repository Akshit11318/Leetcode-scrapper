## Maximum OR
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-or/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`, `1 <= k <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: The maximum result of the bitwise OR operation with `k` numbers from `nums`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - Handling cases where `k` is larger than `nums.length`.
    - Understanding how bitwise OR operation affects the result.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - For `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `k = 2`, the maximum OR result is `7`, obtained by performing `3 | 4`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all combinations of `k` numbers from `nums` and calculate the bitwise OR for each combination.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Generate all combinations of `k` numbers from `nums`.
    2. For each combination, calculate the bitwise OR of its elements.
    3. Keep track of the maximum OR result found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward and ensures considering all possible combinations.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>

int maximumOR(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int maxOr = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    
    // Generate all combinations of k numbers
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
        if (__builtin_popcount(mask) == k) {
            int orResult = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    orResult |= nums[i];
                }
            }
            maxOr = std::max(maxOr, orResult);
        }
    }
    
    return maxOr;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`, due to generating all combinations and calculating the OR for each.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inherently exponential due to considering all possible subsets of `nums`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Utilize a Trie data structure to efficiently store and query the binary representations of numbers in `nums`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Create a Trie and insert the binary representation of each number in `nums`.
    2. For each number in `nums`, calculate the bitwise OR with `k-1` other numbers by traversing the Trie and maximizing the OR at each step.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures we consider all possible combinations of `k` numbers while minimizing the number of operations by leveraging the Trie's efficiency.

```cpp
class TrieNode {
public:
    TrieNode* children[2];
    TrieNode() {
        children[0] = children[1] = nullptr;
    }
};

void insert(TrieNode* root, int num) {
    TrieNode* node = root;
    for (int i = 20; i >= 0; --i) {
        int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
        if (!node->children[bit]) {
            node->children[bit] = new TrieNode();
        }
        node = node->children[bit];
    }
}

int query(TrieNode* root, int num) {
    TrieNode* node = root;
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 20; i >= 0; --i) {
        int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
        if (node->children[1 - bit]) {
            result |= (1 << i);
            node = node->children[1 - bit];
        } else {
            node = node->children[bit];
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int maximumOR(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    TrieNode* root = new TrieNode();
    for (int num : nums) {
        insert(root, num);
    }
    
    int maxOr = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        maxOr = std::max(maxOr, query(root, num));
    }
    
    return maxOr;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot 2^k \cdot 20)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums` and $k$ is the input `k`, due to inserting numbers into the Trie and querying.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot 20)$, for storing the Trie.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it efficiently considers all possible combinations of `k` numbers using the Trie, minimizing the number of operations.
