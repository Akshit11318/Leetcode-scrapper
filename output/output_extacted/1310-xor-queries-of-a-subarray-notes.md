## XOR Queries of a Subarray

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/xor-queries-of-a-subarray/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array `arr` of size `n` and a 2D array `queries` where each query is of the form `[left, right]`, compute the XOR of the subarray `arr[left..right]`.
- Expected output format: Return an array of integers where each integer is the result of the corresponding query.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - `1 <= n <= 10^3`
  - `1 <= queries.length <= 10^3`
  - `0 <= left <= right < n`
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `arr = [1,3,4,8]`, `queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3],[3,3]]`. The output should be `[2,7,4,8]`.
  - Example 2: `arr = [5,7,3,9]`, `queries = [[1,3],[0,2],[2,2]]`. The output should be `[2,10,3]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To solve this problem, we can simply iterate through each query, calculate the XOR of the subarray specified by the query, and store the result.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each query in the `queries` array.
  2. For each query `[left, right]`, calculate the XOR of the subarray `arr[left..right]`.
  3. Store the result in a new array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows from the problem statement and is the most straightforward way to compute the XOR of subarrays.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> xorQueries(std::vector<int>& arr, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& queries) {
    std::vector<int> results;
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int left = query[0];
        int right = query[1];
        int xorResult = 0;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
            xorResult ^= arr[i];
        }
        results.push_back(xorResult);
    }
    return results;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times m)$, where $n$ is the size of the `arr` array and $m$ is the number of queries. This is because for each query, we potentially scan through the entire array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the number of queries. This is because we store the result of each query in a new array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves iterating through each query and for each query, potentially scanning the entire array, leading to the time complexity. The space complexity is due to storing the results of all queries.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can precompute the XOR of all prefixes of the array. Then, for any query `[left, right]`, the XOR of the subarray `arr[left..right]` can be computed as `prefixXOR[right] ^ prefixXOR[left-1]`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Compute the prefix XOR array, where `prefixXOR[i]` is the XOR of all elements in `arr[0..i]`.
  2. For each query `[left, right]`, compute the XOR of the subarray `arr[left..right]` using the formula `prefixXOR[right] ^ prefixXOR[left-1]`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach reduces the time complexity of answering each query to constant time, making it optimal for answering multiple queries on the same array.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> xorQueries(std::vector<int>& arr, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& queries) {
    std::vector<int> prefixXOR(arr.size() + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        prefixXOR[i + 1] = prefixXOR[i] ^ arr[i];
    }
    
    std::vector<int> results;
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int left = query[0];
        int right = query[1];
        int xorResult = prefixXOR[right + 1] ^ prefixXOR[left];
        results.push_back(xorResult);
    }
    return results;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the size of the `arr` array and $m` is the number of queries. This is because we spend $O(n)$ time computing the prefix XOR array and $O(m)$ time answering all queries.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the size of the `arr` array and $m` is the number of queries. This is because we store the prefix XOR array of size $n+1$ and the results of all queries.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the time complexity of answering each query to $O(1)$ after a one-time $O(n)$ computation of the prefix XOR array.
