## Team Dominance by Pass Success
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/team-dominance-by-pass-success/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem provides a list of passes, where each pass is represented as a tuple of `(team_id, player_id, receiver_id)`.
- Expected output format: The goal is to calculate the team dominance by pass success, which is the ratio of successful passes to the total number of passes made by each team.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The problem requires handling cases where a team has no passes or no successful passes.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if a team has 10 passes and 8 of them are successful, the team dominance by pass success is 0.8.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to iterate through each pass and count the number of successful passes for each team.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a dictionary to store the total number of passes for each team.
  2. Create another dictionary to store the number of successful passes for each team.
  3. Iterate through each pass and update the corresponding team's total and successful pass counts.
  4. Calculate the team dominance by pass success for each team by dividing the number of successful passes by the total number of passes.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be the most efficient solution.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

double teamDominanceByPassSuccess(vector<vector<int>>& passes) {
    unordered_map<int, int> totalPasses;
    unordered_map<int, int> successfulPasses;

    for (const auto& pass : passes) {
        int teamId = pass[0];
        int receiverId = pass[2];

        // Assuming a successful pass is one where the receiver is not the same as the player
        bool isSuccessful = receiverId != pass[1];

        totalPasses[teamId]++;
        if (isSuccessful) {
            successfulPasses[teamId]++;
        }
    }

    double teamDominance = 0.0;
    for (const auto& team : totalPasses) {
        int teamId = team.first;
        int total = team.second;
        int successful = successfulPasses[teamId];

        if (total > 0) {
            teamDominance += (double)successful / total;
        }
    }

    return teamDominance;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of passes. This is because we iterate through each pass once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the number of teams. This is because we store the total and successful pass counts for each team in dictionaries.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we only iterate through each pass once. The space complexity is linear because we store a constant amount of information for each team.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved in a single pass through the data, and we can use a single dictionary to store both the total and successful pass counts for each team.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a dictionary to store the total and successful pass counts for each team.
  2. Iterate through each pass and update the corresponding team's total and successful pass counts.
  3. Calculate the team dominance by pass success for each team by dividing the number of successful passes by the total number of passes.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the data and uses a constant amount of space to store the team pass counts.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it has a linear time complexity and uses a minimal amount of space.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

double teamDominanceByPassSuccess(vector<vector<int>>& passes) {
    unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> teamPasses;

    for (const auto& pass : passes) {
        int teamId = pass[0];
        int receiverId = pass[2];

        // Assuming a successful pass is one where the receiver is not the same as the player
        bool isSuccessful = receiverId != pass[1];

        teamPasses[teamId].first++; // total passes
        if (isSuccessful) {
            teamPasses[teamId].second++; // successful passes
        }
    }

    double teamDominance = 0.0;
    for (const auto& team : teamPasses) {
        int total = team.second.first;
        int successful = team.second.second;

        if (total > 0) {
            teamDominance += (double)successful / total;
        }
    }

    return teamDominance;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem demonstrates the use of dictionaries to store and update team pass counts, and the importance of iterating through data only once to achieve optimal time complexity.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires identifying the key insight that leads to the optimal solution, which is using a single dictionary to store both the total and successful pass counts for each team.
- Optimization techniques learned: The problem demonstrates the importance of minimizing the number of passes through the data and using a minimal amount of space to store information.
- Similar problems to practice: Similar problems include calculating team statistics, such as average points scored or total wins, from a list of game results.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: One common error is to iterate through the data multiple times, which can increase the time complexity of the solution.
- Edge cases to watch for: The problem requires handling cases where a team has no passes or no successful passes, which can affect the calculation of the team dominance by pass success.
- Performance pitfalls: One performance pitfall is to use a data structure that has a high overhead, such as a linked list, to store the team pass counts.
- Testing considerations: The problem requires testing the solution with different inputs, such as an empty list of passes or a list with only one team, to ensure that it handles all edge cases correctly.
