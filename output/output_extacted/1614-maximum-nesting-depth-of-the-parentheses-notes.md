## Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-the-parentheses/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A string `s` containing only parentheses.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 100`.
- Expected output format: The maximum nesting depth of the parentheses.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The input string will only contain parentheses.
  - The nesting depth refers to the maximum number of open parentheses that do not have a corresponding closing parenthesis yet.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For input `s = "(1+(2*3)+[4/5])"`, the output should be `3` because the maximum nesting depth is achieved with `((2*3)+[4/5])`.
  - For input `s = "(1+(2*3))"`, the output should be `3` because the maximum nesting depth is achieved with `((2*3))`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to manually iterate over the string and keep track of the current depth and the maximum depth encountered so far.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize two variables: `currentDepth` to keep track of the current nesting depth and `maxDepth` to store the maximum nesting depth encountered.
  2. Iterate over each character in the string.
  3. If the character is an open parenthesis, increment `currentDepth`.
  4. If the character is a close parenthesis, decrement `currentDepth`.
  5. Update `maxDepth` if `currentDepth` is greater than `maxDepth`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward and intuitive approach that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(string s) {
        int currentDepth = 0;
        int maxDepth = 0;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '(') {
                currentDepth++;
                maxDepth = max(maxDepth, currentDepth);
            } else if (c == ')') {
                currentDepth--;
            }
        }
        
        return maxDepth;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the string, because we iterate over the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a single pass through the input string. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store our variables, regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is actually the same as the brute force approach in this case, because the problem requires us to examine each character in the string at least once to determine the maximum nesting depth.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The approach remains the same as the brute force approach: iterate over the string, update the current depth and maximum depth as we encounter open and close parentheses.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it achieves the minimum possible time complexity for this problem, which is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. We must examine each character at least once to determine the maximum nesting depth.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must examine each character in the string at least once to solve the problem. Any algorithm that solves this problem must have a time complexity of at least $O(n)$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(string s) {
        int currentDepth = 0;
        int maxDepth = 0;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '(') {
                currentDepth++;
                maxDepth = max(maxDepth, currentDepth);
            } else if (c == ')') {
                currentDepth--;
            }
        }
        
        return maxDepth;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it achieves the minimum possible time complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional statements, and variable updates.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The need to examine each character in the string at least once to solve the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: This problem demonstrates that sometimes the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation problems, such as counting the number of valid parentheses in a string.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to initialize variables or update them correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty strings or strings with unbalanced parentheses.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary data structures or algorithms that have higher time complexities.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it works correctly.
