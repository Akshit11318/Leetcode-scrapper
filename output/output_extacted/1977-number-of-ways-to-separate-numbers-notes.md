## Number of Ways to Separate Numbers
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-separate-numbers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the number of ways to separate `s` into two non-empty, non-empty strings `num1` and `num2` such that the decimal value of `num1` is less than or equal to the decimal value of `num2`.
- Expected output format: The function should return the number of ways to separate `s` into two non-empty strings `num1` and `num2` such that the decimal value of `num1` is less than or equal to the decimal value of `num2`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input string `s` only contains digits, and the function should return the number of ways to separate `s` into two non-empty strings `num1` and `num2` such that the decimal value of `num1` is less than or equal to the decimal value of `num2`.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - Input: `s = "32"`
    - Output: `2`
    - Explanation: There are two ways to separate `s` into two non-empty strings `num1` and `num2` such that the decimal value of `num1` is less than or equal to the decimal value of `num2`: `"3"` and `"2"`, and `"32"` and `""` (not valid since `num2` is empty).
    - Input: `s = "82734"`
    - Output: `8`
    - Explanation: There are eight ways to separate `s` into two non-empty strings `num1` and `num2` such that the decimal value of `num1` is less than or equal to the decimal value of `num2`: `"8"` and `"2734"`, `"82"` and `"734"`, `"827"` and `"34"`, `"8273"` and `"4"`, `"82734"` and `""` (not valid since `num2` is empty), `"827"` and `"34"`, `"8273"` and `"4"`, `"82734"` and `""` (not valid since `num2` is empty).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating over all possible ways to separate the string `s` into two non-empty strings `num1` and `num2`, and checking if the decimal value of `num1` is less than or equal to the decimal value of `num2`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Iterate over all possible indices `i` to separate the string `s` into two non-empty strings `num1` and `num2`.
    2. For each index `i`, convert the substrings `num1` and `num2` to integers and check if the decimal value of `num1` is less than or equal to the decimal value of `num2`.
    3. If the condition is met, increment the count of valid separations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it has a high time complexity due to the iteration over all possible indices.

```cpp
int numWays(string s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
        string num1 = s.substr(0, i);
        string num2 = s.substr(i);
        if (stoi(num1) <= stoi(num2)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s` and $m$ is the maximum number of digits in a number. This is because we iterate over all possible indices `i` and convert the substrings to integers using `stoi`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and the substrings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high due to the iteration over all possible indices and the conversion of substrings to integers using `stoi`. The space complexity is low since we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of iterating over all possible indices, we can use a prefix sum approach to calculate the number of valid separations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Calculate the prefix sum of the string `s`, where `prefixSum[i]` represents the number of valid separations for the substring `s[0..i]`.
    2. Iterate over the prefix sum array and calculate the number of valid separations for each index `i`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it avoids the iteration over all possible indices and uses a prefix sum approach to calculate the number of valid separations.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the minimum time complexity required to solve the problem.

```cpp
int numWays(string s) {
    int count = 0;
    int prefixSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (s[i] == '0') {
            if (i == 0) {
                prefixSum++;
            } else if (s[i-1] != '0') {
                prefixSum++;
            }
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
        string num1 = s.substr(0, i + 1);
        string num2 = s.substr(i + 1);
        if (stoi(num1) <= stoi(num2)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

However, a better implementation would be as follows:

```cpp
int numWays(string s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
        string num1 = s.substr(0, i);
        string num2 = s.substr(i);
        if (num1[0] == '0' && num1.length() > 1) continue;
        if (num2[0] == '0' && num2.length() > 1) continue;
        if (stoi(num1) <= stoi(num2)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate over the string `s` once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and the substrings.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the minimum time complexity required to solve the problem.
