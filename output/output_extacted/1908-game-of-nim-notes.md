## Game of Nim
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-nim/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: You are given an integer array `piles`, where `piles[i]` is the number of stones in the `i-th` pile. The game of Nim is played between two players, where a player can remove any number of stones from a single pile in their turn.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if the second player can guarantee a win, otherwise return `false`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The first player always starts the game, and a player wins the game if they remove the last stone from the last pile. 
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `piles = [2, 3, 4]`
  - Output: `false`
  - Explanation: The first player can guarantee a win by removing all stones from the first pile.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Simulate all possible moves and their outcomes to determine if the second player can guarantee a win.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize a variable to store the total number of stones.
  2. Iterate through each pile and calculate the XOR of the number of stones in each pile.
  3. If the XOR is not zero, the first player can guarantee a win.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that considers all possible moves.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
};
```

However, this is not a typical brute force solution as it directly uses the mathematical properties of the game. A true brute force approach would involve simulating the game for all possible moves, which would be highly inefficient.

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are performing a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The solution directly uses the mathematical property that the first player can guarantee a win if and only if the total number of stones is not a multiple of 4.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The game of Nim can be solved using the XOR operation. If the XOR of the number of stones in each pile is not zero, the first player can guarantee a win.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize a variable to store the XOR of the number of stones in each pile.
  2. Iterate through each pile and calculate the XOR of the number of stones in each pile.
  3. If the XOR is not zero, the first player can guarantee a win.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it directly uses the mathematical property of the game and has a constant time complexity.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This solution is already optimal, with a time complexity of $O(1)$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are performing a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution directly uses the mathematical property of the game, and the time complexity is constant, making it optimal.
