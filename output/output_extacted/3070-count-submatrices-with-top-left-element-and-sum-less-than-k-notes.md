## Count Submatrices with Top-Left Element and Sum Less Than K
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-submatrices-with-top-left-element-and-sum-less-than-k/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D array `mat` of integers, and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: The number of rows and columns in `mat` will not exceed 100.
- Expected output format: The number of submatrices where the sum of the elements is less than `k`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Submatrices can be of any size, and their sum must be strictly less than `k`. The top-left element of each submatrix is considered.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]` and `k = 4`, the output should be `0` because no submatrix has a sum less than `4`.
  - For `mat = [[1]]` and `k = 2`, the output should be `0` because the sum of the single element submatrix is `1`, which is less than `2`, but since we are considering submatrices with their top-left element and sum less than `k`, and the question asks for submatrices with sum less than `k`, it might seem like an edge case depending on interpretation. However, following the problem's constraints strictly, a single element is indeed a submatrix, and its sum is considered.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible submatrix within the given matrix `mat`.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate over each element in the matrix as a potential top-left corner of a submatrix.
  2. For each top-left element, iterate over all possible widths and heights to form different submatrices.
  3. Calculate the sum of each submatrix.
  4. Check if the sum is less than `k`. If so, increment the count of valid submatrices.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive search that ensures no potential submatrix is overlooked.

```cpp
int numSubmatrixSumTarget(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int k) {
    int rows = mat.size();
    int cols = mat[0].size();
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            for (int x = i; x < rows; x++) {
                for (int y = j; y < cols; y++) {
                    int sum = 0;
                    for (int m = i; m <= x; m++) {
                        for (int n = j; n <= y; n++) {
                            sum += mat[m][n];
                        }
                    }
                    if (sum < k) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^4)$, where $n$ is the maximum of the number of rows or columns in `mat`. This is because for each element, we potentially generate a submatrix of any size up to the size of `mat`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we are not using any additional data structures that scale with input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops to generate all possible submatrices and calculate their sums, leading to high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Utilize a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any submatrix in constant time.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Calculate the prefix sum for the entire matrix `mat`. The prefix sum at position `(i, j)` represents the sum of all elements from `(0,0)` to `(i,j)`.
  2. Iterate over all possible submatrices using four nested loops (two for the top-left corner and two for the bottom-right corner).
  3. For each submatrix, calculate its sum using the prefix sum array. This can be done in constant time by using the formula: `sum = prefix_sum[x][y] - prefix_sum[i-1][y] - prefix_sum[x][j-1] + prefix_sum[i-1][j-1]`.
  4. Check if the calculated sum is less than `k`. If so, increment the count of valid submatrices.
- Proof of optimality: This approach reduces the time complexity significantly by avoiding the need to sum the elements of each submatrix individually, which was the major contributor to the brute force approach's high time complexity.

```cpp
int numSubmatrixSumTarget(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int k) {
    int rows = mat.size();
    int cols = mat[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> prefix_sum(rows + 1, vector<int>(cols + 1, 0));
    int count = 0;
    
    // Calculate prefix sum
    for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= cols; j++) {
            prefix_sum[i][j] = mat[i-1][j-1] + prefix_sum[i-1][j] + prefix_sum[i][j-1] - prefix_sum[i-1][j-1];
        }
    }
    
    // Iterate over all possible submatrices and calculate their sums using prefix sum
    for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= cols; j++) {
            for (int x = i; x <= rows; x++) {
                for (int y = j; y <= cols; y++) {
                    int sum = prefix_sum[x][y] - prefix_sum[i-1][y] - prefix_sum[x][j-1] + prefix_sum[i-1][j-1];
                    if (sum < k) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^4)$, where $n$ is the maximum of the number of rows or columns in `mat`. Although we've optimized the sum calculation, the iteration over all possible submatrices still dominates the time complexity.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the maximum of the number of rows or columns in `mat`, for storing the prefix sum array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal in terms of reducing the constant factors and improving the practical performance, but the time complexity remains the same due to the inherent need to consider all possible submatrices.
