## Maximum Non-Negative Product in a Matrix
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-non-negative-product-in-a-matrix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` where each element is either `0`, `1`, or `-1`, return the maximum non-negative product of a submatrix.
- The submatrix should be a rectangular subset of `grid`.
- The product of a submatrix is the product of all its elements.
- If there is no non-negative product, return `0`.

**Expected Output Format:**
- The function should return an integer representing the maximum non-negative product of a submatrix.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases to Consider:**
- The input matrix `grid` can contain zeros, which will make the product of any submatrix containing them zero.
- The presence of negative numbers can affect the product in two ways: a single negative number will make the product negative, and two negative numbers will make the product positive.
- The maximum product can be achieved by including or excluding certain elements from the submatrix.

**Example Test Cases with Explanations:**
- For a matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, the maximum non-negative product is `6 * 7 * 8 = 336`.
- For a matrix `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`, the maximum non-negative product is `8 * 7 * 6 = 336`.
- For a matrix `[[1, -2, 3], [4, -5, 6], [7, -8, 9]]`, the maximum non-negative product is `9 * 6 * 3 = 162`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to calculate the product of all possible submatrices and keep track of the maximum non-negative product found.
- This approach involves iterating over all possible submatrices, calculating their product, and updating the maximum product if the current product is larger and non-negative.

```cpp
int maxNonNegativeProduct(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int maxProduct = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (int k = i; k < m; k++) {
                for (int l = j; l < n; l++) {
                    long long product = 1;
                    bool hasZero = false;

                    for (int x = i; x <= k; x++) {
                        for (int y = j; y <= l; y++) {
                            if (grid[x][y] == 0) {
                                hasZero = true;
                                break;
                            }
                            product *= grid[x][y];
                        }
                        if (hasZero) break;
                    }

                    if (!hasZero && product > 0) {
                        maxProduct = max(maxProduct, (int)product);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return maxProduct;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m^3 * n^3)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the input matrix. This is because we are iterating over all possible submatrices and calculating their product.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves iterating over all possible submatrices, which results in a high time complexity. The space complexity is low because we are only keeping track of the maximum product found so far.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is to use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum product of submatrices.
- We can maintain two 2D arrays, `maxProduct` and `minProduct`, where `maxProduct[i][j]` stores the maximum product of the submatrix ending at `(i, j)` and `minProduct[i][j]` stores the minimum product of the submatrix ending at `(i, j)`.
- We can then iterate over the input matrix and update `maxProduct` and `minProduct` arrays accordingly.

```cpp
int maxNonNegativeProduct(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int maxProduct = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                maxProduct = max(maxProduct, grid[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    if (maxProduct == 0) return 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                continue;
            }

            vector<vector<long long>> maxProductMatrix(m, vector<long long>(n, 0));
            vector<vector<long long>> minProductMatrix(m, vector<long long>(n, 0));

            maxProductMatrix[i][j] = grid[i][j];
            minProductMatrix[i][j] = grid[i][j];

            for (int k = i + 1; k < m; k++) {
                for (int l = j; l < n; l++) {
                    if (grid[k][l] == 0) {
                        continue;
                    }

                    maxProductMatrix[k][l] = max({maxProductMatrix[k - 1][l], maxProductMatrix[k][l - 1], maxProductMatrix[k - 1][l - 1] * grid[k][l]});
                    minProductMatrix[k][l] = min({minProductMatrix[k - 1][l], minProductMatrix[k][l - 1], minProductMatrix[k - 1][l - 1] * grid[k][l]});

                    if (maxProductMatrix[k][l] > 0) {
                        maxProduct = max(maxProduct, (int)maxProductMatrix[k][l]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return maxProduct;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m^2 * n^2)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the input matrix. This is because we are iterating over the input matrix and updating the `maxProduct` and `minProduct` arrays.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, as we are using two 2D arrays to store the maximum and minimum products of submatrices.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal solution has a lower time complexity than the brute force approach and uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum product of submatrices. This approach is optimal because it avoids recalculating the product of submatrices and uses the previously calculated values to update the `maxProduct` and `minProduct` arrays.
