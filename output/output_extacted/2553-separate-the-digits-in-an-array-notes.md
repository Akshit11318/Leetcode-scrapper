## Separate the Digits in an Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/separate-the-digits-in-an-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer array `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`.
- Expected output format: A boolean indicating whether it's possible to separate the digits.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array can be empty, and each number in the array can have multiple digits.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `nums = [13, 25, 83]`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: We can separate the digits as follows: `[1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 3]`.
  - Input: `nums = [156, 812, 323, 275, 879, 87]`
    - Output: `false`
    - Explanation: No matter how we separate the digits, we will always have duplicate digits.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible ways to separate the digits in each number.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible ways to separate the digits in each number.
  2. For each way, check if there are any duplicate digits.
  3. If we find a way with no duplicate digits, return `true`.
  4. If we try all ways and still find duplicate digits, return `false`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to solve the problem, but it's not efficient.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <string>

bool separateDigits(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::set<int> digits;
    for (int num : nums) {
        std::string str = std::to_string(num);
        for (char c : str) {
            int digit = c - '0';
            if (digits.find(digit) != digits.end()) {
                return false;
            }
            digits.insert(digit);
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array and $m$ is the maximum number of digits in a number.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, as we need to store all the digits in the set.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** We need to iterate over each number in the array and each digit in the number, and we need to store all the digits in the set.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can separate the digits in a way that ensures no duplicates by simply converting each number to a string and concatenating them.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Convert each number to a string and concatenate them.
  2. Iterate over the concatenated string and check if there are any duplicate digits.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures that we don't have to try all possible ways to separate the digits, which would be inefficient.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it has a linear time complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <string>

bool separateDigits(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::string str;
    for (int num : nums) {
        str += std::to_string(num);
    }
    std::set<char> digits;
    for (char c : str) {
        if (digits.find(c) != digits.end()) {
            return false;
        }
        digits.insert(c);
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, string manipulation, and set operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Separating digits in an array and checking for duplicates.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a set to store unique digits and concatenating strings.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems involving string manipulation and set operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for duplicates correctly, not handling edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty array, numbers with multiple digits.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms, not optimizing the code.
- Testing considerations: Test the code with different inputs, including edge cases.
