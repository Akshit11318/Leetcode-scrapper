## Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Palindrome Substrings
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-palindrome-substrings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes a string `s` as input and asks for the maximum number of non-overlapping palindrome substrings that can be found in `s`.
- Expected output format: The output should be an integer representing the maximum number of non-overlapping palindrome substrings.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input string `s` can contain any ASCII characters, and the length of `s` can range from 1 to 1000. The solution should handle these edge cases and provide the correct output.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given the input string `"abccba"`, the maximum number of non-overlapping palindrome substrings is 3 (`"a"`, `"b"`, `"ccba"`).

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves checking every possible substring of the input string `s` to see if it is a palindrome. If a palindrome substring is found, it is added to the list of non-overlapping palindrome substrings.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible substrings of the input string `s`.
  2. For each substring, check if it is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the substring.
  3. If a palindrome substring is found, add it to the list of non-overlapping palindrome substrings.
  4. Remove the characters of the found palindrome substring from the input string `s`.
  5. Repeat steps 1-4 until no more palindrome substrings can be found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it is not efficient due to the large number of possible substrings.

```cpp
int maxPalindromes(string s) {
    int count = 0;
    while (s.length() > 0) {
        bool found = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= s.length(); j++) {
                string substr = s.substr(i, j - i);
                if (isPalindrome(substr)) {
                    count++;
                    s = s.substr(0, i) + s.substr(j);
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) break;
        }
        if (!found) break;
    }
    return count;
}

bool isPalindrome(string s) {
    int start = 0, end = s.length() - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        if (s[start] != s[end]) return false;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string `s`. This is because there are $n^2$ possible substrings, and checking if each substring is a palindrome takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string `s`. This is because the maximum amount of extra space needed to store the substrings is $O(n)$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity due to the nested loops used to generate all possible substrings and check if each substring is a palindrome.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all possible substrings, we can use a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum number of non-overlapping palindrome substrings.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a 2D array `dp` of size $n \times n$, where $dp[i][j]$ represents whether the substring `s[i..j]` is a palindrome.
  2. Fill the `dp` array in a bottom-up manner by checking if each substring is a palindrome.
  3. Use the `dp` array to find the maximum number of non-overlapping palindrome substrings.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant computation and has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.

```cpp
int maxPalindromes(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    vector<vector<bool>> dp(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
    vector<int> maxCount(n, 1);
    
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            if (i == j) dp[i][j] = true;
            else if (j == i + 1) dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]);
            else dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j] && dp[i + 1][j - 1]);
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        maxCount[i] = maxCount[i - 1];
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            if (dp[j][i]) {
                if (j == 0) maxCount[i] = max(maxCount[i], 1);
                else maxCount[i] = max(maxCount[i], maxCount[j - 1] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxCount[n - 1];
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: dynamic programming, palindrome checking.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using dynamic programming to avoid redundant computation.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a 2D array to store intermediate results.
- Similar problems to practice: finding the longest palindromic substring, counting the number of palindromic substrings.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not initializing the `dp` array correctly, not handling edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: empty input string, single-character input string.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach with high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: testing with different input strings, including edge cases.
