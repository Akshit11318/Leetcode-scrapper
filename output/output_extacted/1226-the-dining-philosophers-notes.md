## The Dining Philosophers

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/the-dining-philosophers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: We are given a table with 5 philosophers, each with a plate of food in front of them. There are 5 forks, one between each philosopher. Each philosopher can either eat or think. A philosopher can only eat if they have both the fork to their left and the fork to their right.
- Expected output format: We need to implement the `DiningPhilosophers` class, which has two methods: `void wantsToEat(int philosopher, function<void()> pickLeftFork, function<void()> pickRightFork, function<void()> eat, function<void()> putLeftFork, function<void()> putRightFork)`. This method should call the `pickLeftFork` and `pickRightFork` functions to pick up the left and right forks, then call the `eat` function to eat, and finally call the `putLeftFork` and `putRightFork` functions to put down the forks.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: We need to ensure that a philosopher can only eat if they have both forks, and that a philosopher can only pick up a fork if it is available.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if we have two philosophers, one with the left fork and one with the right fork, the second philosopher should not be able to eat until the first philosopher puts down the left fork.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first thought is to simply have each philosopher try to pick up the left fork, then the right fork, and then eat. However, this approach can lead to a deadlock situation where each philosopher is waiting for the other to put down a fork.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: We can implement a simple `DiningPhilosophers` class with a `wantsToEat` method that tries to pick up the left and right forks, eat, and then put down the forks. However, we need to add some synchronization mechanism to prevent deadlocks.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is simple and straightforward, but it does not consider the possibility of deadlocks.

```cpp
class DiningPhilosophers {
public:
    DiningPhilosophers() {}
    
    void wantsToEat(int philosopher, 
                     function<void()> pickLeftFork, 
                     function<void()> pickRightFork, 
                     function<void()> eat, 
                     function<void()> putLeftFork, 
                     function<void()> putRightFork) {
        // Try to pick up the left fork
        pickLeftFork();
        // Try to pick up the right fork
        pickRightFork();
        // Eat
        eat();
        // Put down the left fork
        putLeftFork();
        // Put down the right fork
        putRightFork();
    }
};
```

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: To prevent deadlocks, we can have each philosopher pick up the lower-numbered fork first. This way, if a philosopher is waiting for a fork, the philosopher who has the fork will always be able to put it down.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: We can implement a `DiningPhilosophers` class with a `wantsToEat` method that tries to pick up the lower-numbered fork first, then the higher-numbered fork, eat, and then put down the forks.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it prevents deadlocks and allows each philosopher to eat when possible.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it prevents deadlocks and allows each philosopher to eat when possible.

```cpp
class DiningPhilosophers {
public:
    DiningPhilosophers() {}
    
    void wantsToEat(int philosopher, 
                     function<void()> pickLeftFork, 
                     function<void()> pickRightFork, 
                     function<void()> eat, 
                     function<void()> putLeftFork, 
                     function<void()> putRightFork) {
        // If the philosopher is the first one, pick up the right fork first
        if (philosopher == 4) {
            // Try to pick up the right fork
            pickRightFork();
            // Try to pick up the left fork
            pickLeftFork();
            // Eat
            eat();
            // Put down the left fork
            putLeftFork();
            // Put down the right fork
            putRightFork();
        } else {
            // Try to pick up the left fork
            pickLeftFork();
            // Try to pick up the right fork
            pickRightFork();
            // Eat
            eat();
            // Put down the right fork
            putRightFork();
            // Put down the left fork
            putLeftFork();
        }
    }
};
```
