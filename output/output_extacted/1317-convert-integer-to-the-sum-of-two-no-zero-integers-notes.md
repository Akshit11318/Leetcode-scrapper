## Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-integer-to-the-sum-of-two-no-zero-integers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `n`.
- Constraints: `2 <= n <= 10^6`.
- Expected Output: An array of two integers `a` and `b` such that `a + b = n` and neither `a` nor `b` is zero.
- Key Requirements: Find any pair of non-zero integers that sum up to `n`.
- Edge Cases: When `n` is even or odd, and when `n` is close to the upper limit of the constraint.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Start by checking every possible pair of integers `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n-1`.
- For each pair, check if `a + b == n`.
- If a pair satisfies the condition, return it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getSum(int n) {
        for (int a = 1; a < n; ++a) {
            int b = n - a;
            if (b != 0) {
                return {a, b};
            }
        }
        return {}; // This line should never be reached due to the problem constraints.
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ because we are potentially checking every integer up to `n`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks every possible pair of integers, leading to linear time complexity. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store our variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Recognize that we can simply return `(1, n-1)` for any `n > 2`, as this satisfies the condition of both integers being non-zero and summing to `n`.
- Handle the special case when `n` is `2` by returning `(1, 1)`, but since both numbers must be non-zero and different, this case actually has no solution under the given constraints. However, given the constraints `2 <= n <= 10^6`, and the fact that we are looking for any pair of non-zero integers, for `n=2`, we can return `(1, 1)` but with a note that this technically doesn't meet the "no-zero" criteria if strictly interpreted. For all other `n`, `(1, n-1)` is a valid solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getSum(int n) {
        if (n == 2) {
            // Technically, there's no solution for n=2 under strict interpretation, but (1,1) could be considered in a more relaxed interpretation.
            return {1, 1};
        } else {
            return {1, n - 1};
        }
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we perform a constant number of operations regardless of `n`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we directly compute the solution without any unnecessary iterations or recursive calls, achieving constant time complexity.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- The importance of carefully reading problem constraints to identify simple, constant-time solutions.
- Recognizing that for certain problems, a brute force approach might not be necessary due to the existence of a straightforward, constant-time solution.
- Understanding the trade-offs between time and space complexity in algorithm design.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Assuming that all problems require complex algorithms or brute force approaches.
- Failing to consider the constraints and how they might simplify the problem.
- Not optimizing for the most common or critical cases in the problem domain.
