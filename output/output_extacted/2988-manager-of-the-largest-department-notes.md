## Manager of the Largest Department

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/manager-of-the-largest-department/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `employees` where each element represents the department ID and manager ID of an employee, and an array of strings `department` where each element represents the department name and the number of employees in that department.
- Expected output: The department name and the number of employees in that department with the most employees. If there are multiple departments with the same number of employees, return the department with the lexicographically smallest name.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling empty inputs
  - Dealing with duplicate department names
  - Determining the department with the most employees

**Example Test Cases:**

- `employees = [[3, 3], [4, -1], [5, 3], [2, 4], [6, 3]]` and `department = ["Sales", "Engineering", "Marketing", "HR", "IT"]`
- `employees = [[1, -1]]` and `department = ["IT"]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Create a mapping of department IDs to their respective names and counts of employees. Then, iterate through the `employees` array to populate this mapping. Finally, find the department with the maximum count of employees and return its name along with the count.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a `departmentMap` to store department IDs as keys and their names as values.
  2. Create a `countMap` to store department IDs as keys and the count of employees as values.
  3. Iterate through the `employees` array and update the `countMap` accordingly.
  4. Find the department ID with the maximum count in the `countMap`.
  5. Return the department name and count for the department with the maximum count.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

void findLargestDepartment(vector<vector<int>>& employees, vector<string>& department) {
    map<int, string> departmentMap;
    map<int, int> countMap;

    // Populate departmentMap
    for (int i = 0; i < department.size(); i++) {
        departmentMap[i + 1] = department[i];
    }

    // Populate countMap
    for (const auto& employee : employees) {
        int departmentId = employee[0];
        countMap[departmentId]++;
    }

    int maxCount = 0;
    string maxDepartment = "";

    // Find department with max count
    for (const auto& pair : countMap) {
        if (pair.second > maxCount) {
            maxCount = pair.second;
            maxDepartment = departmentMap[pair.first];
        } else if (pair.second == maxCount) {
            if (departmentMap[pair.first] < maxDepartment) {
                maxDepartment = departmentMap[pair.first];
            }
        }
    }

    cout << maxDepartment << " " << maxCount << endl;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> employees = {{3, 3}, {4, -1}, {5, 3}, {2, 4}, {6, 3}};
    vector<string> department = {"Sales", "Engineering", "Marketing", "HR", "IT"};

    findLargestDepartment(employees, department);

    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ where $n$ is the number of employees and $m$ is the number of departments. This is because we iterate through the `employees` array and the `department` array once each.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ as we use two maps to store department IDs and their names, and counts of employees.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach requires iterating through all employees and departments to populate the maps and find the department with the maximum count, resulting in linear time complexity. The space complexity is also linear due to the use of maps to store department information.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a single pass through the `employees` array to populate a map that stores department IDs as keys and a pair containing the department name and count of employees as values. This eliminates the need for separate maps for department names and counts.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a `departmentMap` to store department IDs as keys and a pair containing the department name and count of employees as values.
  2. Iterate through the `employees` array and update the `departmentMap` accordingly.
  3. Find the department ID with the maximum count in the `departmentMap`.
  4. Return the department name and count for the department with the maximum count.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

void findLargestDepartment(vector<vector<int>>& employees, vector<string>& department) {
    map<int, pair<string, int>> departmentMap;

    // Populate departmentMap
    for (int i = 0; i < department.size(); i++) {
        departmentMap[i + 1] = {department[i], 0};
    }

    // Populate departmentMap with employee counts
    for (const auto& employee : employees) {
        int departmentId = employee[0];
        departmentMap[departmentId].second++;
    }

    int maxCount = 0;
    string maxDepartment = "";

    // Find department with max count
    for (const auto& pair : departmentMap) {
        if (pair.second.second > maxCount) {
            maxCount = pair.second.second;
            maxDepartment = pair.second.first;
        } else if (pair.second.second == maxCount) {
            if (pair.second.first < maxDepartment) {
                maxDepartment = pair.second.first;
            }
        }
    }

    cout << maxDepartment << " " << maxCount << endl;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> employees = {{3, 3}, {4, -1}, {5, 3}, {2, 4}, {6, 3}};
    vector<string> department = {"Sales", "Engineering", "Marketing", "HR", "IT"};

    findLargestDepartment(employees, department);

    return 0;
}
```
