## Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/split-two-strings-to-make-palindrome/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two strings `a` and `b`, check if you can form a palindrome by concatenating `a` with the reverse of `b`.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if the concatenation of `a` and the reverse of `b` forms a palindrome, otherwise return `false`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - Handle cases where `a` and `b` are empty strings.
    - Consider cases where `a` or `b` individually are palindromes.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - If `a = "x"` and `b = "y"`, then the concatenation of `a` and the reverse of `b` is `"xyy"`, which is not a palindrome.
    - If `a = "ulacfd"` and `b = "fcda"`, then the concatenation of `a` and the reverse of `b` is `"ulacfdcda"`, which is a palindrome.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check every possible concatenation of `a` and the reverse of `b` to see if it forms a palindrome.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Reverse `b` to get `b_reverse`.
    2. Concatenate `a` with `b_reverse` to get `concat`.
    3. Check if `concat` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly checks the condition specified in the problem.

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

bool checkPalindromeFormation(string a, string b) {
    // Function to check if a string is a palindrome
    auto isPalindrome = [](string s) {
        string rev = s;
        reverse(rev.begin(), rev.end());
        return s == rev;
    };

    // Check if concatenation of a and reverse of b is a palindrome
    string concat_ab = a + string(b.rbegin(), b.rend());
    if (isPalindrome(concat_ab)) return true;

    // Check if concatenation of b and reverse of a is a palindrome
    string concat_ba = b + string(a.rbegin(), a.rend());
    if (isPalindrome(concat_ba)) return true;

    return false;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively. This is because we reverse `a` and `b`, and then concatenate them, which takes linear time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, as we create new strings for the reverse and concatenation of `a` and `b`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we only iterate over the strings a constant number of times. The space complexity is also linear because we create new strings that are at most the length of `a` plus the length of `b`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of reversing the entire string and then checking if the concatenation is a palindrome, we can compare characters from the start and end of the concatenation and move towards the center.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the concatenation.
    2. Compare the characters at the pointers. If they are equal, move the pointers towards the center.
    3. If the characters are not equal, try removing characters from the start or end of the concatenation and check if the remaining string is a palindrome.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the strings `a` and `b`, resulting in a linear time complexity.

```cpp
#include <string>

bool checkPalindromeFormation(string a, string b) {
    auto check = [](string a, string b) {
        int i = 0, j = a.size() - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            if (a[i] != a[j]) break;
            i++, j--;
        }
        return i >= j || checkPalindrome(a, i, j) || checkPalindrome(a, j, i);
    };

    auto checkPalindrome = [](string a, int i, int j) {
        while (i < j) {
            if (a[i] != a[j]) return false;
            i++, j--;
        }
        return true;
    };

    return check(a + string(b.rbegin(), b.rend()), b) || check(b + string(a.rbegin(), a.rend()), a);
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Two-pointer technique, palindrome checking, and string manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems, using helper functions to improve code readability.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary string reversals and concatenations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other palindrome-related problems, such as checking if a string is a palindrome or finding the longest palindromic substring.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling edge cases, such as empty strings or strings with a single character.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `a` and `b` are empty strings or have different lengths.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures that result in high time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with different input cases, including edge cases and boundary cases.
