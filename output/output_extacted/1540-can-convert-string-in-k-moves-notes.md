## Can Convert String in K Moves

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/can-convert-string-in-k-moves/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes two strings `s` and `target` and an integer `k` as input. The goal is to determine if it's possible to convert `s` into `target` in `k` moves or less, where a move is defined as shifting all characters in `s` one position to the right and wrapping the last character around to the first position.
- Expected output format: The function should return `true` if the conversion is possible within `k` moves and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The strings `s` and `target` should be of the same length, and `k` should be a non-negative integer. The function should handle cases where `s` and `target` are already identical, where `s` can be converted to `target` in fewer moves than `k`, and where conversion is impossible within `k` moves.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - Example 1: `s = "abc", target = "bca", k = 1`. The function should return `true` because shifting `s` one position to the right results in `target`.
    - Example 2: `s = "abc", target = "bca", k = 0`. The function should return `false` because no moves are allowed.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The simplest approach to solving this problem is to simulate the shifting process for `k` moves and check after each move if `s` has been converted to `target`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Initialize a variable to track the number of moves made.
    2. Enter a loop that continues for `k` moves.
    3. Inside the loop, shift the characters in `s` one position to the right and wrap the last character around to the first position.
    4. After each shift, check if `s` is now equal to `target`.
    5. If `s` equals `target`, return `true`.
    6. If the loop completes without finding a match, return `false`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConvertString(string s, string target, int k) {
        if (s.size() != target.size()) return false;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            // Shift s one position to the right
            char temp = s[s.size() - 1];
            for (int j = s.size() - 1; j > 0; j--) {
                s[j] = s[j - 1];
            }
            s[0] = temp;
            
            // Check if s equals target after the shift
            if (s == target) return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`. This is because in the worst case, we might need to perform the shift operation `k` times, and each shift operation takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, assuming the input strings do not count towards space complexity. The space used does not grow with the size of the input, as we are modifying the input string in place.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because of the repeated shift operations, and the space complexity is low because we're modifying the input string directly.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of simulating each move, we can calculate the minimum number of shifts required to convert `s` to `target` by comparing the positions of characters in `s` and `target`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Calculate the difference in positions for each character in `s` and `target`.
    2. If any difference is greater than `k`, return `false` because it's impossible to convert `s` to `target` within `k` moves.
    3. For differences that are not zero, check if the total number of moves required exceeds `k`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of moves needed without simulating each move, thus reducing the time complexity significantly.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConvertString(string s, string target, int k) {
        if (s.size() != target.size()) return false;
        
        int totalMoves = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != target[i]) {
                int moves = (target[i] - s[i] + 26) % 26; // Calculate moves needed for this character
                if (moves > k) return false; // If moves needed for this character exceeds k, return false
                totalMoves += moves;
            }
        }
        
        return totalMoves <= k;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`. This is because we are scanning the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, assuming the input strings do not count towards space complexity. The space used does not grow with the size of the input.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of moves required to convert `s` to `target` without unnecessary simulations, thus achieving the best possible time complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem illustrates the importance of understanding how to calculate the minimum number of operations (in this case, shifts) needed to transform one string into another.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The solution involves recognizing patterns in string manipulation and applying modular arithmetic to efficiently calculate the required moves.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimal approach shows how to avoid unnecessary simulations and directly calculate the outcome, significantly improving efficiency.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation problems, such as finding the minimum number of operations to transform one string into another under different constraints.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to handle edge cases, such as when `s` and `target` are of different lengths or when `k` is zero.
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring the function correctly handles scenarios where `s` and `target` are already identical or where conversion is impossible within `k` moves.
- Performance pitfalls: Using simulation-based approaches for large inputs, which can lead to high time complexities.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with a variety of inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it behaves as expected.
