## Put Boxes into the Warehouse II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/put-boxes-into-the-warehouse-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given an array `boxes` where each `boxes[i]` is an array of two integers representing the dimensions of the `i-th` box. You are also given an array `warehouse` where each `warehouse[i]` is an array of two integers representing the dimensions of the `i-th` shelf in the warehouse.
- Constraints: `1 <= boxes.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= warehouse.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= boxes[i][0], boxes[i][1] <= 10^6`, `1 <= warehouse[i][0], warehouse[i][1] <= 10^6`.
- Expected output format: The maximum number of boxes that can be put into the warehouse.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    * Each box can only be put into the warehouse if its width is less than or equal to the width of the shelf and its height is less than or equal to the height of the shelf.
    * If a box can be put into a shelf, it must be put into the shelf with the smallest width that it can fit into.
    * If there are multiple shelves with the same width, the box must be put into the shelf with the smallest height.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    * `boxes = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`, `warehouse = [[3, 4], [2, 3], [1, 2]]`. The maximum number of boxes that can be put into the warehouse is 3.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating over each box and checking if it can fit into each shelf. If a box can fit into a shelf, we put it into the shelf and move on to the next box.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Sort the boxes by their width in descending order.
    2. Iterate over each box.
    3. For each box, iterate over each shelf.
    4. If the box can fit into the shelf, put it into the shelf and move on to the next box.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it is not efficient because it involves a lot of unnecessary comparisons.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxBoxes(vector<vector<int>>& boxes, vector<vector<int>>& warehouse) {
    int max_boxes = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < boxes.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < warehouse.size(); j++) {
            if (boxes[i][0] <= warehouse[j][0] && boxes[i][1] <= warehouse[j][1]) {
                max_boxes++;
                // Remove the box and the shelf from the arrays
                boxes.erase(boxes.begin() + i);
                warehouse.erase(warehouse.begin() + j);
                i--;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return max_boxes;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the number of boxes and $m$ is the number of shelves. This is because in the worst case, we have to iterate over each box and each shelf.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because of the nested loops, and the space complexity occurs because we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a greedy approach to solve this problem. We sort the boxes by their width in descending order and the shelves by their width in ascending order. Then, we iterate over each box and try to put it into the first shelf that it can fit into.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Sort the boxes by their width in descending order.
    2. Sort the shelves by their width in ascending order.
    3. Iterate over each box.
    4. For each box, try to put it into the first shelf that it can fit into.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures that we put each box into the shelf with the smallest width that it can fit into. This is because we sort the boxes by their width in descending order and the shelves by their width in ascending order.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxBoxes(vector<vector<int>>& boxes, vector<vector<int>>& warehouse) {
    sort(boxes.begin(), boxes.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
        return a[0] > b[0];
    });
    sort(warehouse.begin(), warehouse.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
        return a[0] < b[0];
    });
    int max_boxes = 0;
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < boxes.size(); j++) {
        while (i < warehouse.size() && (boxes[j][0] > warehouse[i][0] || boxes[j][1] > warehouse[i][1])) {
            i++;
        }
        if (i < warehouse.size()) {
            max_boxes++;
            i++;
        }
    }
    return max_boxes;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + m \log m)$ where $n$ is the number of boxes and $m$ is the number of shelves. This is because we sort the boxes and the shelves.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it ensures that we put each box into the shelf with the smallest width that it can fit into.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy algorithm, sorting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a greedy approach to solve problems that involve putting objects into containers.
- Optimization techniques learned: Sorting the objects and containers to reduce the number of comparisons.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve putting objects into containers, such as the "Container With Most Water" problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not sorting the objects and containers correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where there are no boxes or no shelves.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that involves a lot of unnecessary comparisons.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
