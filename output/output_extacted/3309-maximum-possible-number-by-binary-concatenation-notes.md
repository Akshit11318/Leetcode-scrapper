## Maximum Possible Number by Binary Concatenation

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-possible-number-by-binary-concatenation/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`, `1 <= k <= 15`.
- Expected output format: The maximum possible number by concatenating `k` binary strings.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input array can contain duplicates, and the binary strings can be concatenated in any order.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 2`: The maximum possible number is `11011` by concatenating the binary strings of `3` and `2`.
  - `nums = [10, 20, 30], k = 1`: The maximum possible number is `11110` by concatenating the binary string of `30`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of `k` binary strings and find the maximum possible number.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Convert each number in `nums` to its binary string.
  2. Generate all possible combinations of `k` binary strings.
  3. For each combination, concatenate the binary strings and convert the result to a decimal number.
  4. Keep track of the maximum possible number found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach, but it has a high time complexity due to the generation of all possible combinations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int maximumBinaryString(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::vector<std::string> binaryStrings;
    for (int num : nums) {
        std::string binaryString;
        while (num > 0) {
            binaryString = (num % 2 == 0 ? "0" : "1") + binaryString;
            num /= 2;
        }
        binaryStrings.push_back(binaryString);
    }

    int maxNumber = 0;
    std::vector<int> indices(k);
    std::fill(indices.begin(), indices.end(), 0);

    do {
        std::string concatenatedString;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            concatenatedString += binaryStrings[indices[i]];
        }
        maxNumber = std::max(maxNumber, std::stoi(concatenatedString, 0, 2));
    } while (std::next_permutation(indices.begin(), indices.end(), [&binaryStrings](int a, int b) {
        return binaryStrings[a] < binaryStrings[b];
    }));

    return maxNumber;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^k \cdot k \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`, $k$ is the number of concatenations, and $m$ is the maximum length of a binary string. This is because we generate all possible combinations of `k` binary strings and concatenate each combination.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums` and $m$ is the maximum length of a binary string. This is because we store the binary strings for each number in `nums`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity occurs because we generate all possible combinations of `k` binary strings, and the space complexity occurs because we store the binary strings for each number in `nums`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all possible combinations of `k` binary strings, we can sort the binary strings in descending order and select the top `k` strings to concatenate.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Convert each number in `nums` to its binary string.
  2. Sort the binary strings in descending order.
  3. Select the top `k` binary strings and concatenate them.
  4. Convert the concatenated string to a decimal number.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures that the maximum possible number is obtained by concatenating the largest possible binary strings.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int maximumBinaryString(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::vector<std::string> binaryStrings;
    for (int num : nums) {
        std::string binaryString;
        while (num > 0) {
            binaryString = (num % 2 == 0 ? "0" : "1") + binaryString;
            num /= 2;
        }
        binaryStrings.push_back(binaryString);
    }

    std::sort(binaryStrings.begin(), binaryStrings.end(), [](const std::string& a, const std::string& b) {
        if (a.length() != b.length()) {
            return a.length() > b.length();
        }
        return a > b;
    });

    std::string concatenatedString;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        concatenatedString += binaryStrings[i];
    }

    return std::stoi(concatenatedString, 0, 2);
}
```

> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot log(n))$, where $n$ is the length of `nums` and $m$ is the maximum length of a binary string. This is because we sort the binary strings in descending order.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums` and $m` is the maximum length of a binary string. This is because we store the binary strings for each number in `nums`.
