## Sort Items by Groups Respecting Dependencies

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-items-by-groups-respecting-dependencies/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes in three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `group`, where `n` is the number of items, `m` is the number of groups, and `group` is an array of integers where `group[i]` is the group that item `i` belongs to. Additionally, two arrays `beforeItems` and `afterItems` represent the dependencies between items.
- Expected output format: The function should return an array of item indices in a valid order that respects all dependencies.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The function should handle invalid input, such as cyclic dependencies, and return an empty array in such cases.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `n = 5`, `m = 3`, `group = [2,0,-1,1,0]`, `beforeItems = [[-1,0],[2,-1],[0,1],[3,-1],[4,-1]]`, and `afterItems = [[-1,1],[0,-1],[2,0],[4,-1],[3,1]]`, the function should return a valid order of item indices that respects all dependencies.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves checking all possible permutations of item indices and verifying if each permutation satisfies all dependencies.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of item indices.
  2. For each permutation, iterate through the dependencies and check if the permutation satisfies all dependencies.
  3. If a permutation satisfies all dependencies, return it as a valid order.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and guarantees a correct solution if the input is valid.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> sortItems(int n, int m, std::vector<int>& group, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& beforeItems, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& afterItems) {
    std::vector<int> items(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        items[i] = i;
    }

    do {
        bool valid = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < beforeItems[i].size(); j++) {
                if (std::find(items.begin(), items.end(), beforeItems[i][j]) > std::find(items.begin(), items.end(), items[i])) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!valid) break;
        }
        if (valid) return items;
    } while (std::next_permutation(items.begin(), items.end()));

    return {};
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n! \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of items. The permutation generation has a time complexity of $O(n!)$, and the dependency checking has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of items. The space complexity is dominated by the storage of the item indices.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates all permutations of item indices, resulting in a high time complexity. The space complexity is relatively low since only the current permutation needs to be stored.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using topological sorting with a twist. We need to perform topological sorting on both the item dependencies and the group dependencies.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Build the graph of item dependencies and group dependencies.
  2. Perform topological sorting on the graph.
  3. If a valid order is found, return it; otherwise, return an empty array.
- Proof of optimality: The topological sorting approach has a time complexity of $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of items and $m$ is the number of groups. This is optimal since we need to visit each item and group at least once.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

std::vector<int> sortItems(int n, int m, std::vector<int>& group, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& beforeItems, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& afterItems) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> graph(n);
    std::vector<int> inDegree(n, 0);

    // Build the graph of item dependencies
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < beforeItems[i].size(); j++) {
            graph[beforeItems[i][j]].push_back(i);
            inDegree[i]++;
        }
    }

    // Perform topological sorting
    std::queue<int> queue;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (inDegree[i] == 0) queue.push(i);
    }

    std::vector<int> order;
    while (!queue.empty()) {
        int item = queue.front();
        queue.pop();
        order.push_back(item);

        for (int neighbor : graph[item]) {
            inDegree[neighbor]--;
            if (inDegree[neighbor] == 0) queue.push(neighbor);
        }
    }

    // Check if a valid order is found
    if (order.size() != n) return {};

    return order;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Topological sorting, graph traversal, and dependency resolution.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires a combination of graph traversal and dependency resolution techniques.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimal approach uses topological sorting to reduce the time complexity from $O(n! \cdot n^2)$ to $O(n + m)$.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve topological sorting and dependency resolution, such as course scheduling and task scheduling.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling cyclic dependencies correctly, not checking for invalid input, and not using efficient data structures.
- Edge cases to watch for: Cyclic dependencies, invalid input, and empty input.
- Performance pitfalls: Using brute force approaches or inefficient algorithms, not optimizing the code for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Test the code with different input sizes, including large inputs, and verify that it handles edge cases correctly.
