## Zigzag Grid Traversal with Skip
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-grid-traversal-with-skip/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: `int n` and `int m` representing the number of rows and columns in the grid.
- Input constraints: `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= m <= 100`.
- Expected output format: A vector of integers representing the zigzag traversal of the grid with skip.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The grid is 1-indexed, and the traversal starts from the top-left corner.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For a grid with `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the output should be `[1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 9, 8]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can iterate over the grid row by row and append the elements to the result vector in a zigzag pattern.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty vector `result` to store the traversal.
  2. Iterate over each row in the grid.
  3. For each row, iterate over each column.
  4. If the row index is even, append the elements from left to right. Otherwise, append the elements from right to left.
  5. Return the `result` vector.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward solution that directly implements the zigzag traversal pattern.

```cpp
vector<int> traverseGrid(int n, int m) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                result.push_back(i * m + j + 1);
            }
        } else {
            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                result.push_back(i * m + j + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. This is because we iterate over each element in the grid once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. This is because we store the traversal in a vector of size $n \cdot m$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a linear time complexity because it iterates over each element in the grid once. The space complexity is also linear because we store the traversal in a vector of size $n \cdot m$.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a similar approach to the brute force solution but optimize it by using a single loop to iterate over the rows and columns.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty vector `result` to store the traversal.
  2. Initialize a variable `dir` to keep track of the direction of the traversal (1 for left to right, -1 for right to left).
  3. Iterate over each row in the grid.
  4. For each row, iterate over each column in the direction specified by `dir`.
  5. Update `dir` after each row to alternate the direction of the traversal.
  6. Return the `result` vector.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has the same time complexity as the brute force solution but uses a single loop to iterate over the rows and columns.

```cpp
vector<int> traverseGrid(int n, int m) {
    vector<int> result;
    int dir = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (dir == 1) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                result.push_back(i * m + j + 1);
            }
        } else {
            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                result.push_back(i * m + j + 1);
            }
        }
        dir *= -1;
    }
    return result;
}
```
