## Maximum Binary String After Change
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-string-after-change/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a binary string `binary`, return the maximum binary string of the same length that can be obtained by flipping at most one `0` to `1`.
- Expected output format: The maximum binary string that can be obtained.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling strings with no `0`s, strings with a single `0`, and strings with multiple `0`s.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `binary = "000111"`
    - Output: `"011111"`
    - Explanation: We can flip the first `0` to `1` to get the maximum binary string.
  - Input: `binary = "01"`
    - Output: `"01"`
    - Explanation: We cannot flip any `0` to `1` to get a larger binary string.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of flipping a single `0` to `1` and compare the resulting binary strings.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through the input string to find all occurrences of `0`.
  2. For each `0`, create a new string by flipping that `0` to `1`.
  3. Compare the new string with the current maximum binary string.
  4. Update the maximum binary string if the new string is larger.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that checks all possible combinations.

```cpp
string maximumBinaryString(string binary) {
    string maxBinary = binary;
    for (int i = 0; i < binary.length(); i++) {
        if (binary[i] == '0') {
            string newBinary = binary;
            newBinary[i] = '1';
            if (newBinary > maxBinary) {
                maxBinary = newBinary;
            }
        }
    }
    return maxBinary;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string. This is because we're iterating through the string and creating a new string for each `0`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string. This is because we're creating a new string for each `0`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is quadratic because we're iterating through the string and creating a new string for each `0`. The space complexity is linear because we're creating a new string for each `0`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of trying all possible combinations of flipping a single `0` to `1`, we can simply find the first `0` in the string and flip it to `1`. If there are no `0`s, the string is already the maximum binary string.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Find the first `0` in the string.
  2. If a `0` is found, flip it to `1`.
  3. Return the resulting string.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it always results in the maximum binary string. Flipping the first `0` to `1` will always result in a larger binary string than flipping any other `0` to `1`.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the minimum possible time complexity for this problem. We must iterate through the string at least once to find the first `0`.

```cpp
string maximumBinaryString(string binary) {
    for (int i = 0; i < binary.length(); i++) {
        if (binary[i] == '0') {
            binary[i] = '1';
            break;
        }
    }
    return binary;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string. This is because we're iterating through the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string. This is because we're modifying the input string in place.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it always results in the maximum binary string. Flipping the first `0` to `1` will always result in a larger binary string than flipping any other `0` to `1`.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, string manipulation, and optimization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Finding the first occurrence of a character in a string and modifying the string in place.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary iterations and modifying the input string in place.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation problems, such as finding the longest substring with a certain property.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty input string.
- Edge cases to watch for: An input string with no `0`s, an input string with a single `0`, and an input string with multiple `0`s.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary iterations or creating unnecessary strings.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input strings, including edge cases.
