## Minimum Array Sum

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-array-sum/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of the same length `n`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6`.
- Expected output format: The minimum sum of the `n` elements after applying the given operation.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling large numbers, avoiding integer overflow, and considering all possible pairings of elements.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For `nums1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `nums2 = [3, 2, 1]`, the minimum sum is `10` because we can square `1`, `2`, and `3` to get `1`, `4`, and `9`, and then add them together to get `14`, but since we are looking for the minimum sum, we square the smaller numbers and multiply the larger ones, resulting in `(1*2) + (2*3) + (3*1) = 2 + 6 + 3 = 11`. However, we are looking for a more optimal solution.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible pairings of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`, calculate the sum for each pairing, and find the minimum sum.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Generate all permutations of `nums1` and `nums2`.
    2. For each permutation, calculate the sum of the products of corresponding elements.
    3. Keep track of the minimum sum found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to consider all possible pairings and find the minimum sum.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

long long minimumSum(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    // Generate all permutations of nums1 and nums2
    sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    sort(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());
    
    long long minSum = LLONG_MAX;
    do {
        long long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
            sum += (long long)nums1[i] * nums2[i];
        }
        minSum = min(minSum, sum);
    } while (next_permutation(nums2.begin(), nums2.end()));
    
    return minSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$ due to generating all permutations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the permutations.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible pairings, resulting in a factorial time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Since we want to minimize the sum, we should pair the smallest numbers with the largest numbers to minimize the product of each pair.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Sort both `nums1` and `nums2` in ascending order.
    2. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of `nums1` and one at the end of `nums2`.
    3. Calculate the sum of the products of corresponding elements.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that the smallest numbers are paired with the largest numbers, resulting in the minimum sum.

```cpp
long long minimumSum(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    // Sort both nums1 and nums2 in ascending order
    sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    sort(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());
    
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
        sum += (long long)nums1[i] * nums2[nums1.size() - i - 1];
    }
    
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to sorting both arrays.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ since we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach ensures that the smallest numbers are paired with the largest numbers, resulting in the minimum sum.
