## Make a Square with the Same Color
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/make-a-square-with-the-same-color/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 3x3 grid, represented as a vector of vectors of integers, where each integer represents a color.
- Constraints: The grid will only contain integers from 1 to 9.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if it is possible to make a square with the same color, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - A square can be formed by rotating the grid.
    - A square can be formed by selecting any 4 adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) of the same color.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - `[[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]` returns `true` because the entire grid is already a square of the same color.
    - `[[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,0]]` returns `false` because there is no way to rotate or select cells to form a square of the same color.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check every possible rotation and selection of cells to see if a square can be formed.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Generate all possible rotations of the grid (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees).
    2. For each rotation, check all possible selections of 4 adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically).
    3. If any selection of cells has the same color, return `true`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and exhaustive approach that checks all possibilities.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossibleToCutPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        // Function to rotate the grid by 90 degrees
        auto rotate = [](vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
            int n = grid.size();
            vector<vector<int>> newGrid(n, vector<int>(n));
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    newGrid[j][n - 1 - i] = grid[i][j];
                }
            }
            return newGrid;
        };

        // Function to check if a square can be formed in the grid
        auto canFormSquare = [](vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
            int n = grid.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    // Check horizontally
                    if (j < n - 1 && grid[i][j] == grid[i][j + 1]) {
                        return true;
                    }
                    // Check vertically
                    if (i < n - 1 && grid[i][j] == grid[i + 1][j]) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
            return false;
        };

        // Check all rotations
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            if (canFormSquare(grid)) {
                return true;
            }
            grid = rotate(grid);
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the size of the grid and $k$ is the number of rotations (4 in this case). The reason for this complexity is that we are checking all possible selections of cells for each rotation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, because we need to store the rotated grid.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks all possibilities, resulting in a high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of checking all rotations and selections of cells, we can simply check if there are at least 4 cells of the same color in the grid.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Count the occurrences of each color in the grid.
    2. If any color has at least 4 occurrences, return `true`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it checks the minimum required condition for a square to be formed (at least 4 cells of the same color).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossibleToCutPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        // Count the occurrences of each color
        unordered_map<int, int> colorCount;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                colorCount[grid[i][j]]++;
            }
        }
        // Check if any color has at least 4 occurrences
        for (auto& pair : colorCount) {
            if (pair.second >= 4) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the size of the grid. The reason for this complexity is that we are counting the occurrences of each color in the grid.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the color counts.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it checks the minimum required condition for a square to be formed (at least 4 cells of the same color).

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Brute force, optimal solution, counting occurrences of each color.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking all possibilities, using key insights to optimize the solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Counting occurrences of each color, using a hash map to store color counts.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve counting occurrences of each element, such as finding the most frequent element in an array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking all possibilities in the brute force approach, not using a hash map to store color counts in the optimal approach.
- Edge cases to watch for: Grids with less than 4 cells of the same color, grids with no cells of the same color.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach for large grids, not optimizing the solution for small grids.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different grid sizes, testing the solution with different color distributions.
