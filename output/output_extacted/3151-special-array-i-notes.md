## Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-with-x-elements-greater-than-or-equal-x/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-with-x-elements-greater-than-or-equal-x/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an array of integers `nums` and an integer `x`. The constraints are that `nums` has a length between 1 and $10^5$, and each element in `nums` is between 0 and $10^9$. The integer `x` is between 0 and $10^9$.
- Expected output format: The output should be the length of the special array if it exists, otherwise -1.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The special array should have exactly `x` elements greater than or equal to `x`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = [3,5,2,6]` and `x = 2`, the output should be 2 because there are exactly 2 elements greater than or equal to 2.
  - For `nums = [3,5,2,6]` and `x = 4`, the output should be -1 because there is no special array with exactly 4 elements greater than or equal to 4.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can try all possible lengths of the special array and check if the number of elements greater than or equal to the length is equal to the length.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Sort the array `nums` in ascending order.
  2. Iterate over all possible lengths `x` from 1 to the length of `nums`.
  3. For each length `x`, count the number of elements greater than or equal to `x`.
  4. If the count is equal to `x`, return `x`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and checks all possible cases.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int specialArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    for (int x = 1; x <= nums.size(); x++) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num >= x) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count == x) {
            return x;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. This is because we are iterating over all possible lengths and for each length, we are iterating over the array to count the number of elements greater than or equal to the length.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because of the nested loops, and the space complexity occurs because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the count and the length.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the fact that the array is sorted to reduce the time complexity.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the array `nums` in ascending order.
  2. Iterate over the array `nums` and for each element, check if the number of elements greater than or equal to the index plus one is equal to the index plus one.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we are only iterating over the array once and using the fact that the array is sorted to reduce the time complexity.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is optimal because we must check all elements in the array at least once to determine if the special array exists.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int specialArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    for (int x = 1; x <= nums.size(); x++) {
        if (nums[nums.size() - x] >= x) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num >= x) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count == x) {
                return x;
            }
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

However, we can further optimize this solution by using a binary search approach.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int specialArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    for (int x = 1; x <= nums.size(); x++) {
        if (nums[nums.size() - x] >= x) {
            int count = std::upper_bound(nums.begin(), nums.end(), x - 1) - nums.begin();
            if (count == x) {
                return x;
            }
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. This is because we are sorting the array and then iterating over it.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are using the fact that the array is sorted to reduce the time complexity, and we are only iterating over the array once.
