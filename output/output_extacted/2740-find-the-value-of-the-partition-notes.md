## Find the Value of the Partition
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-value-of-the-partition/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves finding the maximum value of a partition for a given array `nums` and an integer `k`. The array `nums` represents the values of the items, and `k` represents the number of groups to divide the items into.
- Expected output format: The function should return the maximum value of a partition.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The function should handle cases where the input array is empty or contains a single element, and it should also handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the array.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2`, the function should return `6` because the optimal partition is `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]`.
  - Example 2: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3`, the function should return `9` because the optimal partition is `[1, 2]`, `[3]`, and `[4, 5]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves generating all possible partitions of the array and calculating the maximum value of each partition.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible partitions of the array.
  2. For each partition, calculate the maximum value of the partition.
  3. Return the maximum value of all partitions.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is often the first solution that comes to mind because it involves exhaustively checking all possible solutions.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int findPartitionValue(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int n = nums.size();
    int max_val = 0;
    
    // Generate all possible partitions
    vector<vector<int>> partitions;
    vector<int> partition;
    generatePartitions(nums, 0, partition, partitions);
    
    // Calculate the maximum value of each partition
    for (auto& p : partitions) {
        int partition_max_val = 0;
        int group_count = 0;
        int group_sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            group_sum += p[i];
            if (group_sum > partition_max_val) {
                partition_max_val = group_sum;
            }
            if (i == n - 1 || p[i + 1] > group_sum) {
                group_count++;
                group_sum = 0;
            }
        }
        if (group_count <= k) {
            max_val = max(max_val, partition_max_val);
        }
    }
    
    return max_val;
}

void generatePartitions(vector<int>& nums, int start, vector<int>& partition, vector<vector<int>>& partitions) {
    if (start == nums.size()) {
        partitions.push_back(partition);
        return;
    }
    for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        swap(nums[start], nums[i]);
        partition.push_back(nums[start]);
        generatePartitions(nums, start + 1, partition, partitions);
        partition.pop_back();
        swap(nums[start], nums[i]);
    }
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. This is because we generate all possible partitions of the array, which has a time complexity of $O(2^n)$, and then calculate the maximum value of each partition, which has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot k)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. This is because we store all possible partitions of the array, which has a space complexity of $O(2^n \cdot n)$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we use a recursive approach to generate all possible partitions of the array, which has an exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using a binary search approach to find the maximum value of the partition.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of the partition.
  2. Perform a binary search to find the maximum value of the partition.
  3. For each mid value, calculate the number of groups required to partition the array.
  4. If the number of groups is less than or equal to $k$, update the minimum possible value.
  5. If the number of groups is greater than $k$, update the maximum possible value.
- Proof of optimality: The binary search approach is optimal because it reduces the search space by half at each step, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n \log m)$, where $n$ is the length of the array and $m$ is the maximum value of the array.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int findPartitionValue(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int max_val = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int min_val = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0) / k;
    
    int result = 0;
    while (min_val <= max_val) {
        int mid = min_val + (max_val - min_val) / 2;
        int groups = 1;
        int group_sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            group_sum += num;
            if (group_sum > mid) {
                groups++;
                group_sum = num;
            }
        }
        if (groups <= k) {
            result = mid;
            max_val = mid - 1;
        } else {
            min_val = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log m)$, where $n$ is the length of the array and $m$ is the maximum value of the array. This is because we perform a binary search to find the maximum value of the partition.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. This is because we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum and maximum possible values.
> - **Optimality proof:** The binary search approach is optimal because it reduces the search space by half at each step, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n \log m)$.
