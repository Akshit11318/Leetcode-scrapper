## Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-exceed-threshold-value-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves an array `nums` and a `threshold` value. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations to make the sum of the array exceed the threshold. Each operation involves replacing the smallest element in the array with a value that is twice the current smallest element plus 2.
- Expected output format: The function should return the minimum number of operations required.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The array `nums` may be empty.
  - The `threshold` value may be negative.
  - The array elements may be negative.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `nums = [1, 5, 20]`, `threshold = 33`. The minimum number of operations is 3.
  - `nums = [2, 6, 14, 34]`, `threshold = 25`. The minimum number of operations is 0.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One possible approach is to simulate the operations and keep track of the sum of the array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the number of operations.
  2. Initialize a variable to store the sum of the array.
  3. While the sum of the array is less than or equal to the threshold:
    a. Find the smallest element in the array.
    b. Replace the smallest element with a value that is twice the current smallest element plus 2.
    c. Increment the number of operations.
    d. Update the sum of the array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach that simulates the operations.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
    int operations = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        sum += num;
    }
    while (sum <= threshold) {
        int minVal = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] < minVal) {
                minVal = nums[i];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == minVal) {
                nums[i] = 2 * nums[i] + 2;
                break;
            }
        }
        sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
        }
        operations++;
    }
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array and $m$ is the number of operations required to exceed the threshold. This is because in the worst case, we need to find the smallest element in the array in each operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the number of operations and the sum of the array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we need to iterate over the array to find the smallest element and update the sum in each operation. The space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space to store the necessary variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a priority queue to keep track of the smallest element in the array. This allows us to find and update the smallest element in $O(\log n)$ time.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a priority queue with the elements of the array.
  2. Initialize a variable to store the number of operations.
  3. Initialize a variable to store the sum of the array.
  4. While the sum of the array is less than or equal to the threshold:
    a. Extract the smallest element from the priority queue.
    b. Update the sum of the array by subtracting the smallest element.
    c. Insert the updated smallest element (twice the current smallest element plus 2) into the priority queue.
    d. Update the sum of the array by adding the updated smallest element.
    e. Increment the number of operations.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a priority queue to keep track of the smallest element in the array, which allows us to find and update the smallest element in $O(\log n)$ time.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
    for (int num : nums) {
        pq.push(num);
    }
    int operations = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        sum += num;
    }
    while (sum <= threshold) {
        int minVal = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        sum -= minVal;
        pq.push(2 * minVal + 2);
        sum += 2 * minVal + 2;
        operations++;
    }
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \log n + m \cdot \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array and $m$ is the number of operations required to exceed the threshold. This is because we use a priority queue to keep track of the smallest element in the array, and each insertion and extraction operation takes $O(\log n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we use a priority queue to store the elements of the array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a priority queue to keep track of the smallest element in the array, which allows us to find and update the smallest element in $O(\log n)$ time.
