## Count All Possible Routes
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-all-possible-routes/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given an array of `n` integers `places` representing the locations to visit, and an integer `start` representing the starting location.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 15`, `0 <= places[i] <= 100`.
- Expected output format: The number of possible routes from the starting location to all other locations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The number of possible routes can be very large, and the input array `places` is guaranteed to contain distinct integers.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `places = [1,2,3]` and `start = 0`, the output should be `4` because there are four possible routes: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`, `0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2`, `0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3`, and `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible permutations of the locations and count the number of valid routes.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Generate all permutations of the locations.
  2. For each permutation, check if it represents a valid route (i.e., the route starts at the starting location and visits all other locations).
  3. Count the number of valid routes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int countRoutes(std::vector<int>& places, int start) {
    int n = places.size();
    int count = 0;
    std::vector<int> permutation(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        permutation[i] = i;
    }
    do {
        if (permutation[0] == start) {
            bool valid = true;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                if (places[permutation[i]] < places[permutation[i - 1]]) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (valid) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    } while (std::next_permutation(permutation.begin(), permutation.end()));
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$ because we generate all permutations of the locations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ because we need to store the permutation.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity because generating all permutations of the locations is an expensive operation.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use dynamic programming to store the number of valid routes ending at each location.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid routes ending at location `i` with the last `j` locations visited.
  2. Fill the `dp` array in a bottom-up manner.
  3. The final answer is stored in `dp[start][n]`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int countRoutes(std::vector<int>& places, int start) {
    int n = places.size();
    const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(1 << n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[1 << i][i] = 1;
    }
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (dp[mask][i] == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((mask >> j) & 1) {
                    continue;
                }
                if (places[j] >= places[i]) {
                    dp[mask | (1 << j)][j] = (dp[mask | (1 << j)][j] + dp[mask][i]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i != start) {
            count = (count + dp[(1 << n) - 1][i]) % MOD;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot 2^n)$ because we fill the `dp` array in a bottom-up manner.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot 2^n)$ because we need to store the `dp` array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we avoid generating all permutations of the locations and instead use dynamic programming to store the number of valid routes ending at each location.
