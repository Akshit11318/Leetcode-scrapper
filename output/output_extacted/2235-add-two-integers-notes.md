## Add Two Integers
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-integers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two integers, `a` and `b`.
- Constraints: `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`.
- Expected output format: The sum of `a` and `b`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling negative numbers, zero, and the possibility of overflow (though the constraints ensure this won't happen in this specific problem).
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - `a = 1, b = 2`, expected output: `3`.
  - `a = -1, b = 2`, expected output: `1`.
  - `a = 0, b = 0`, expected output: `0`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The simplest way to add two integers is to directly use the addition operator.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Take two integers as input.
  2. Add them together using the `+` operator.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's the most straightforward method, directly utilizing basic arithmetic operations.

```cpp
int addTwoIntegers(int a, int b) {
    // Directly add the two integers
    return a + b;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as this operation is constant time, regardless of the input size.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because no additional space that scales with input size is used.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The operation is a simple arithmetic addition, which does not depend on the size of the input integers in terms of time or space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem is straightforward and doesn't require any complex algorithms or data structures beyond basic arithmetic.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: Directly add the two integers using the `+` operator.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it achieves the result in constant time and space, which is the best possible complexity for this problem.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Given that the operation is fundamental and does not scale with input size, further optimization in terms of time or space complexity is not possible.

```cpp
int addTwoIntegers(int a, int b) {
    // Directly add the two integers
    return a + b;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the operation is constant time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because no additional space is used.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution is optimal because it uses the most basic and efficient operation available for the task, which cannot be improved upon in terms of time or space complexity.
