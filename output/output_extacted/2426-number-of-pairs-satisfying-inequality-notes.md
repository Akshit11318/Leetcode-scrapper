## Number of Pairs Satisfying Inequality
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-pairs-satisfying-inequality/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two arrays `x` and `y`, and an integer `bound`.
- Constraints: `1 <= x.length, y.length <= 100`, `1 <= x[i], y[i] <= 100`, and `1 <= bound <= 10000`.
- Expected output: The number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `x[i] * y[j] <= bound`.
- Key requirements: Iterate through all pairs of elements from the two arrays and count the pairs that satisfy the given inequality.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible pair of elements from the two arrays.
- Step-by-step breakdown: Iterate through each element in the first array, then for each element in the first array, iterate through each element in the second array. Check if the product of the current pair of elements is less than or equal to the bound. If it is, increment the count of pairs.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most straightforward method to ensure all pairs are considered.

```cpp
int numPairsDivisibleBy60(vector<int>& time) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < time.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < time.size(); j++) {
            if ((time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
However, the above code doesn't solve the exact problem. The following code is for the exact problem:
```cpp
int numPairsSatisfyingInequality(vector<int>& x, vector<int>& y, int bound) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < x.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < y.size(); j++) {
            if (x[i] * y[j] <= bound) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n*m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the sizes of the input arrays `x` and `y`, respectively. This is because for each element in `x`, we potentially check every element in `y`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not including the space needed for the input arrays, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count of pairs.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The nested loops cause the time complexity to be the product of the sizes of the input arrays. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to realize that the brute force approach is already quite efficient for the given constraints. However, we can slightly optimize it by ensuring we don't perform unnecessary multiplications.
- Detailed breakdown: We iterate through each pair of elements from the two arrays and check if their product is less than or equal to the bound. This is essentially the same as the brute force approach but with a focus on direct calculation without unnecessary steps.

```cpp
int numPairsSatisfyingInequality(vector<int>& x, vector<int>& y, int bound) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int xi : x) {
        for (int yi : y) {
            if (xi * yi <= bound) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n*m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the sizes of the input arrays `x` and `y`, respectively. This remains the same as the brute force approach because the fundamental operation of checking every pair of elements does not change.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we still only use a constant amount of space to store the count of pairs.
> - **Optimality proof:** Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, checking every pair of elements is necessary to ensure all satisfying pairs are counted. Thus, the time complexity is optimal for this specific problem context.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional checks, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The use of nested loops to check all possible pairs of elements from two arrays.
- Optimization techniques learned: Ensuring calculations are direct and necessary, avoiding unnecessary operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving array iterations and conditional checks, such as finding pairs that satisfy certain conditions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect loop bounds, forgetting to initialize counters, or using incorrect conditional statements.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input arrays, arrays with a single element, or when the bound is very large or very small.
- Performance pitfalls: Using overly complex data structures or algorithms when simpler ones suffice.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various input sizes, including edge cases like empty arrays or arrays with a single element.
