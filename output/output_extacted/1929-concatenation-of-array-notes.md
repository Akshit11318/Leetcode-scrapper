## Concatenation of Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes a list of integers `nums` as input.
- Expected output format: The output should be a list of integers resulting from the concatenation of the input list with itself.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input list can be empty, and the output should be a new list object, not a modified version of the input list.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `nums = [1,2,1]`
    Output: `[1,2,1,1,2,1]`
  - Input: `nums = [1,3,2,1]`
    Output: `[1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The simplest way to solve this problem is to create a new list and append the input list to itself.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a new empty list to store the result.
  2. Append the input list to the result list.
  3. Append the input list to the result list again.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly implements the problem statement without considering optimization.

```cpp
vector<int> getConcatenation(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (int num : nums) {
        result.push_back(num);
    }
    for (int num : nums) {
        result.push_back(num);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input list, because we are iterating over the input list twice.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we are creating a new list that is twice the size of the input list.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are performing a constant amount of work for each element in the input list. The space complexity is also linear because we are creating a new list that scales with the size of the input list.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of appending elements one by one, we can use the `insert` function to concatenate the two lists in a single operation.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a copy of the input list.
  2. Use the `insert` function to concatenate the copy with the original input list.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it achieves the same result as the brute force approach but in a more efficient manner by minimizing the number of operations.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The problem requires creating a new list that is twice the size of the input list, so the time and space complexities are inherently linear.

```cpp
vector<int> getConcatenation(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> result = nums;
    result.insert(result.end(), nums.begin(), nums.end());
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input list, because the `insert` function iterates over the input list once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we are creating a new list that is twice the size of the input list.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most efficient solution because it minimizes the number of operations required to concatenate the lists.
