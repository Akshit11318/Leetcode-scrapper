## Transpose Matrix

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-matrix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a matrix `A` with dimensions `m x n`, where `m` and `n` are the number of rows and columns respectively.
- Expected output format: The transpose of matrix `A`, denoted as `A^T`, with dimensions `n x m`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input matrix `A` can have any number of rows and columns. The output matrix `A^T` should have the correct dimensions and values.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - Input: `A = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]`
    - Output: `[[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]`
    - Explanation: The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows with columns.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Create a new matrix with dimensions `n x m` and iterate through each element of the input matrix `A`. For each element `A[i][j]`, assign its value to the corresponding element in the new matrix at position `[j][i]`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize a new matrix `A_T` with dimensions `n x m`.
    2. Iterate through each element `A[i][j]` in the input matrix `A`.
    3. Assign the value of `A[i][j]` to `A_T[j][i]`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive way to transpose a matrix.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> transpose(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        int m = A.size();
        int n = A[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> A_T(n, vector<int>(m));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                A_T[j][i] = A[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return A_T;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the number of rows and columns in the input matrix `A`. This is because we iterate through each element of the input matrix once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, as we need to store the transposed matrix `A_T` with the same number of elements as the input matrix `A`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the nested loops iterating through each element of the input matrix, while the space complexity is due to the additional memory needed to store the transposed matrix.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal in terms of time complexity, as we must visit each element of the input matrix at least once to transpose it.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach is the same as the brute force approach, as it has a time complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$ and a space complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$.
- Proof of optimality: The time complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$ is optimal because we must iterate through each element of the input matrix at least once to transpose it. The space complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$ is also optimal because we need to store the transposed matrix with the same number of elements as the input matrix.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must visit each element of the input matrix at least once to transpose it, resulting in a time complexity of at least $O(m \cdot n)$. Similarly, we must store the transposed matrix with the same number of elements as the input matrix, resulting in a space complexity of at least $O(m \cdot n)$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> transpose(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        int m = A.size();
        int n = A[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> A_T(n, vector<int>(m));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                A_T[j][i] = A[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return A_T;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Matrix transposition, time and space complexity analysis.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The need to visit each element of the input matrix at least once to transpose it, resulting in a time complexity of at least $O(m \cdot n)$.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, as the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Matrix multiplication, matrix inversion.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly initializing the transposed matrix, failing to iterate through each element of the input matrix.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input matrix, input matrix with zero rows or columns.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient algorithm with a higher time or space complexity than necessary.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input matrices, including edge cases, to ensure it produces the correct output.
