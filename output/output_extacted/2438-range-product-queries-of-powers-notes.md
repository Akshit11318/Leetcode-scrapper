## Range Product Queries of Powers

**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/range-product-queries-of-powers/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-product-queries-of-powers/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given an array `powers` of size `n` and an array `queries` of size `q`, where each query is in the format `[left, right, power]`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= q <= 10^5`, `0 <= left < right < n`, `0 <= power <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: For each query, return the result of `(powers[left] * powers[left + 1] * ... * powers[right]) ^ power`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling large numbers, optimizing the computation of products, and managing the queries efficiently.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `powers = [2,3,4], queries = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3]]`
- Output: `[36, 64]`
- Explanation: For the first query, the product is `2 * 3 = 6`, and `6 ^ 2 = 36`. For the second query, the product is `3 * 4 = 12`, and `12 ^ 3 = 1728`, but the result is `64` due to integer overflow.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each query, compute the product of the elements in the specified range and then raise the product to the specified power.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each query.
  2. For each query, compute the product of the elements in the specified range.
  3. Raise the product to the specified power and return the result.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<int> powerOfProducts(vector<int>& powers, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> results;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int left = query[0];
        int right = query[1];
        int power = query[2];
        long long product = 1;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
            product *= powers[i];
        }
        long long result = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < power; ++i) {
            result *= product;
        }
        results.push_back(result);
    }
    return results;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(q * (right - left) * power)$, where $q$ is the number of queries, $right - left$ is the maximum range size, and $power$ is the maximum power.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(q)$, where $q$ is the number of queries.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity due to the nested loops for computing the product and raising it to the power.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use the property of exponentiation to reduce the number of multiplications required.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Precompute the prefix products for the `powers` array.
  2. For each query, use the prefix products to compute the product of the elements in the specified range in constant time.
  3. Raise the product to the specified power using the property of exponentiation.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<int> powerOfProducts(vector<int>& powers, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> results;
    vector<long long> prefixProducts(powers.size() + 1, 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < powers.size(); ++i) {
        prefixProducts[i + 1] = prefixProducts[i] * powers[i];
    }
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int left = query[0];
        int right = query[1];
        int power = query[2];
        long long product = prefixProducts[right + 1] / prefixProducts[left];
        long long result = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < power; ++i) {
            result *= product;
        }
        results.push_back(result);
    }
    return results;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + q * power)$, where $n$ is the size of the `powers` array, $q$ is the number of queries, and $power$ is the maximum power.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + q)$, where $n$ is the size of the `powers` array and $q$ is the number of queries.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach reduces the time complexity by precomputing the prefix products, which allows for constant-time computation of the product for each query.
