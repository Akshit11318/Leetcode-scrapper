## Find the Number of Good Pairs II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-good-pairs-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a list of integers `nums`, and an integer `k`, find the number of pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= k`.
- Input format and constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`, `0 <= k <= 10^9`.
- Expected output format: The number of good pairs.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling large inputs, optimizing the comparison of pairs, and accurately calculating the absolute difference.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves comparing each pair of numbers in the list to check if their absolute difference is within the given limit `k`.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate over the list with two nested loops to generate all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
  2. For each pair, calculate the absolute difference `abs(nums[i] - nums[j])`.
  3. Check if this difference is less than or equal to `k`. If so, increment a counter for good pairs.

```cpp
int countGoodPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the size of `nums`, because we compare each element with every other element once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count of good pairs.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The nested loops over the list of numbers cause the quadratic time complexity, while the constant space complexity results from only using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight for the optimal solution involves using a data structure that allows for efficient counting of numbers within a certain range, such as a `map` or an array if the range of numbers is limited.
- However, given the large range of possible values in `nums`, a more efficient approach might involve sorting the numbers and then using a two-pointer technique or a similar method to count pairs within the distance `k`.
- Since the problem asks for pairs where `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= k`, we can think of this as a problem of finding all pairs of numbers that are at most `k` apart.

```cpp
int countGoodPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int left = i + 1;
        int right = nums.size();
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] - nums[i] <= k) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        count += left - i - 1;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting operation, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. The subsequent loop and binary search contribute to a total time complexity that remains $O(n \log n)$ because the binary search within the loop does not exceed the cost of the initial sort.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ if we consider the input as given and do not count the space needed for sorting if the sorting algorithm used is in-place (like the standard `sort` in C++), otherwise $O(n)$ for sorting algorithms that require additional space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it reduces the problem to a sorting and then a linear scan with binary searches, which is more efficient than comparing each pair directly.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated include sorting, binary search, and the use of two pointers or similar techniques for efficient counting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified include reducing a problem to a more manageable form through sorting and then applying efficient search or counting methods.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors include incorrect handling of edge cases (like empty lists or lists with a single element) and not considering the efficiency of the algorithm for large inputs.
- Performance pitfalls include using algorithms with high time complexities for large datasets and not optimizing the use of space when dealing with very large inputs.
