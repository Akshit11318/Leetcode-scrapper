## Find the Count of Good Integers
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-count-of-good-integers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two integers `low` and `high`.
- Constraints: `1 <= low <= high <= 10^10`.
- Expected Output: The number of good integers in the range `[low, high]`.
- Key Requirements: A good integer is one that is divisible by `2` or `3` but not both.
- Example Test Cases:
  - Input: `low = 1`, `high = 2`
    - Output: `1`
  - Input: `low = 3`, `high = 4`
    - Output: `2`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate over every number in the range `[low, high]` and check if it is divisible by `2` or `3` but not both.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize a counter variable `count` to `0`.
  2. Iterate over the range `[low, high]`.
  3. For each number, check if it is divisible by `2` and not `3`, or divisible by `3` and not `2`.
  4. If the condition is met, increment `count`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, intuitive approach that directly checks each number against the problem's criteria.

```cpp
int countGoodIntegers(int low, int high) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = low; i <= high; i++) {
        if ((i % 2 == 0 && i % 3 != 0) || (i % 3 == 0 && i % 2 != 0)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(high - low)$, because in the worst case, we have to iterate over every number in the range.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks every number individually, leading to a linear time complexity with respect to the range size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Recognize that the pattern of divisibility by `2` or `3` but not both repeats every `6` numbers (since `6` is the least common multiple of `2` and `3`).
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Calculate how many complete sets of `6` numbers are in the range `[low, high]`.
  2. Determine the remainder numbers after subtracting the complete sets from the range.
  3. Count the good integers in the complete sets and the remainder numbers separately.
- Proof of optimality: This approach reduces the number of operations significantly by leveraging the pattern of divisibility, making it more efficient than the brute force method.

```cpp
int countGoodIntegers(int low, int high) {
    int count = 0;
    int completeSets = (high - low) / 6;
    int remainder = (high - low) % 6;
    
    // Count in complete sets
    count += completeSets * 2; // 2 good integers in every 6
    
    // Count in remainder
    for (int i = 0; i <= remainder; i++) {
        int num = low + i;
        if ((num % 2 == 0 && num % 3 != 0) || (num % 3 == 0 && num % 2 != 0)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we perform a constant number of operations regardless of the input size, aside from the small loop for the remainder which does not depend on the input size in a significant way.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations by leveraging the mathematical pattern of the problem, making it much more efficient than checking every number individually.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concept: Pattern recognition and leveraging mathematical properties to optimize solutions.
- Problem-solving pattern: Looking for repeating patterns or cycles in problems to reduce computational complexity.
- Optimization technique: Using mathematical insights to minimize the number of operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not recognizing the pattern of divisibility by `2` and `3`.
- Failing to account for the remainder numbers after subtracting complete sets.
- Not optimizing the solution by still iterating over every number in the range.

By recognizing the pattern of divisibility and leveraging it to minimize the number of operations, we achieve a significant improvement in efficiency over the brute force approach.
