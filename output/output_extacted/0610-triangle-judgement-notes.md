## Triangle Judgement
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle-judgement/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes six integers as input, representing the lengths of three line segments.
- Expected output format: The function should return a string indicating whether the three line segments can form a triangle.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the output should be "Not Possible" because the three line segments cannot form a triangle.
  - If the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7], the output should be "Possible" because the three line segments can form a triangle.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check all possible combinations of three line segments to see if they can form a triangle.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Define the lengths of the three line segments as `a`, `b`, and `c`.
  2. Use three nested loops to generate all possible combinations of three line segments.
  3. For each combination, check if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.
  4. If a valid combination is found, return "Possible".
  5. If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, return "Not Possible".
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive solution that checks all possible cases.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

string triangleJudgement(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f) {
    // Define all possible combinations of three line segments
    int segments[6] = {a, b, c, d, e, f};
    
    // Use three nested loops to generate all possible combinations
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < 6; j++) {
            for (int k = j + 1; k < 6; k++) {
                // Check if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side
                if (segments[i] + segments[j] > segments[k] && segments[i] + segments[k] > segments[j] && segments[j] + segments[k] > segments[i]) {
                    return "Possible";
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If no valid combination is found, return "Not Possible"
    return "Not Possible";
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of line segments. In this case, $n = 6$, so the time complexity is $O(1)$, but it would be $O(n^3)$ if we were considering a variable number of line segments.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we only use a constant amount of space to store the lengths of the line segments.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we use three nested loops to generate all possible combinations of three line segments. The space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space to store the lengths of the line segments.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can simply check all possible combinations of three line segments without using nested loops.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Define the lengths of the three line segments as `a`, `b`, and `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f`.
  2. Check all possible combinations of three line segments.
  3. For each combination, check if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.
  4. If a valid combination is found, return "Possible".
  5. If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, return "Not Possible".
- Why further optimization is impossible: This solution has a time complexity of $O(1)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

string triangleJudgement(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f) {
    // Check all possible combinations of three line segments
    if (a + b > c && a + c > b && b + c > a) return "Possible";
    if (a + b > d && a + d > b && b + d > a) return "Possible";
    if (a + b > e && a + e > b && b + e > a) return "Possible";
    if (a + b > f && a + f > b && b + f > a) return "Possible";
    if (a + c > d && a + d > c && c + d > a) return "Possible";
    if (a + c > e && a + e > c && c + e > a) return "Possible";
    if (a + c > f && a + f > c && c + f > a) return "Possible";
    if (a + d > e && a + e > d && d + e > a) return "Possible";
    if (a + d > f && a + f > d && d + f > a) return "Possible";
    if (a + e > f && a + f > e && e + f > a) return "Possible";
    if (b + c > d && b + d > c && c + d > b) return "Possible";
    if (b + c > e && b + e > c && c + e > b) return "Possible";
    if (b + c > f && b + f > c && c + f > b) return "Possible";
    if (b + d > e && b + e > d && d + e > b) return "Possible";
    if (b + d > f && b + f > d && d + f > b) return "Possible";
    if (b + e > f && b + f > e && e + f > b) return "Possible";
    if (c + d > e && c + e > d && d + e > c) return "Possible";
    if (c + d > f && c + f > d && d + f > c) return "Possible";
    if (c + e > f && c + f > e && e + f > c) return "Possible";
    if (d + e > f && d + f > e && e + f > d) return "Possible";
    
    // If no valid combination is found, return "Not Possible"
    return "Not Possible";
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Checking all possible combinations of three line segments to determine if they can form a triangle.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a brute force approach to check all possible combinations, and then optimizing the solution to reduce the time complexity.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity by checking all possible combinations in constant time.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve checking all possible combinations of a set of elements, such as finding all possible subsets of a set.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to check all possible combinations of three line segments, or using an inefficient algorithm to check the combinations.
- Edge cases to watch for: Failing to handle the case where the input lengths are not valid (e.g., negative lengths).
- Performance pitfalls: Using an algorithm with a high time complexity, such as $O(n^3)$, to check all possible combinations.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with a variety of input lengths to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.
