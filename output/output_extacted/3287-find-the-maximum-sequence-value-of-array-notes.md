## Find the Maximum Sequence Value of Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-sequence-value-of-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `n` and a 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [l, r, val]`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`, `0 <= l <= r < n`, `1 <= val <= 10^6`.
- Expected output: The maximum sequence value after processing all queries.
- Key requirements: For each query, update the elements in the range `[l, r]` to be `val` if the current value is less than `val`.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `n = 5`, `queries = [[1, 2, 10], [0, 2, 20], [1, 4, 30]]`
  - Output: `30`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initialize an array of size `n` with all elements as `0`.
- For each query, iterate over the range `[l, r]` and update the elements if the current value is less than `val`.
- After all queries, find the maximum value in the array.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxSequenceValue(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& queries) {
    std::vector<int> arr(n, 0);
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int l = query[0], r = query[1], val = query[2];
        for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) {
            if (arr[i] < val) arr[i] = val;
        }
    }
    return *std::max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot q)$, where $n$ is the size of the array and $q$ is the number of queries. This is because in the worst case, we might need to iterate over the entire range for each query.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the array. This is because we need to store the array of size $n$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves iterating over the range for each query, which leads to a time complexity of $O(n \cdot q)$. The space complexity is $O(n)$ because we need to store the array of size $n$.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- We can use a segment tree to store the maximum value in each range. This allows us to update the values in $O(\log n)$ time and query the maximum value in $O(\log n)$ time.
- We initialize the segment tree with all elements as $0$.
- For each query, we update the range `[l, r]` to be `val` if the current value is less than `val`.
- After all queries, we query the maximum value in the segment tree.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class SegmentTree {
public:
    SegmentTree(int n) : n(n), tree(4 * n) {}

    void update(int l, int r, int val) {
        update(1, 0, n - 1, l, r, val);
    }

    int query() {
        return query(1, 0, n - 1);
    }

private:
    void update(int node, int start, int end, int l, int r, int val) {
        if (start > r || end < l) return;
        if (start >= l && end <= r) {
            tree[node] = val;
            return;
        }
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        update(2 * node, start, mid, l, r, val);
        update(2 * node + 1, mid + 1, end, l, r, val);
        tree[node] = std::max(tree[2 * node], tree[2 * node + 1]);
    }

    int query(int node, int start, int end) {
        if (start == end) return tree[node];
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        return std::max(query(2 * node, start, mid), query(2 * node + 1, mid + 1, end));
    }

    int n;
    std::vector<int> tree;
};

int maxSequenceValue(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& queries) {
    SegmentTree segmentTree(n);
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int l = query[0], r = query[1], val = query[2];
        segmentTree.update(l, r, val);
    }
    return segmentTree.query();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(q \cdot \log n)$, where $q$ is the number of queries and $n$ is the size of the array. This is because we update the segment tree for each query in $O(\log n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the array. This is because we need to store the segment tree of size $4n$.
> - **Optimality proof:** The segment tree approach allows us to update the values in $O(\log n)$ time and query the maximum value in $O(\log n)$ time, which is optimal for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Segment tree, range updates, and range queries.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a segment tree to solve range update and query problems.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a segment tree to reduce the time complexity of range updates and queries.
- Similar problems to practice: Range sum queries, range minimum queries, and range maximum queries.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly updating the segment tree or querying the segment tree.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where the range is empty or the value is not updated.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach instead of a segment tree.
- Testing considerations: Testing the segment tree implementation with different inputs and edge cases.
