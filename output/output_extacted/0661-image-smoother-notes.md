## Image Smoother
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/image-smoother/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/image-smoother/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D integer array `M` representing the image, where each pixel value is in the range `[0, 255]`.
- Constraints: `1 <= M.length <= 200`, `1 <= M[0].length <= 200`, `0 <= M[i][j] <= 255`.
- Expected output format: A 2D integer array where each pixel value is the average of the neighboring pixels in the input image.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The neighboring pixels of a pixel at `(i, j)` include the pixels at positions `(i-1, j-1)`, `(i-1, j)`, `(i-1, j+1)`, `(i, j-1)`, `(i, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, `(i+1, j-1)`, `(i+1, j)`, and `(i+1, j+1)`.
  - If a pixel is located at the boundary of the image, it may not have all nine neighboring pixels.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - For the input `M = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]`, the output should be `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`.
  - For the input `M = [[100,200,100],[200,50,200],[100,200,100]]`, the output should be `[[137,141,137],[141,138,141],[137,141,137]]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To smooth the image, we can calculate the average of neighboring pixels for each pixel.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty 2D array `smoothed` with the same dimensions as the input image `M`.
  2. Iterate over each pixel `(i, j)` in the input image `M`.
  3. For each pixel, calculate the sum of neighboring pixels and count the number of neighboring pixels.
  4. Calculate the average of neighboring pixels by dividing the sum by the count.
  5. Assign the average value to the corresponding pixel in the `smoothed` array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive solution that directly implements the problem statement.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> imageSmoother(vector<vector<int>>& M) {
    int m = M.size();
    int n = M[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> smoothed(m, vector<int>(n));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int sum = 0;
            int count = 0;
            for (int x = max(0, i-1); x <= min(m-1, i+1); x++) {
                for (int y = max(0, j-1); y <= min(n-1, j+1); y++) {
                    sum += M[x][y];
                    count++;
                }
            }
            smoothed[i][j] = sum / count;
        }
    }
    return smoothed;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n \cdot 9)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the input image. The reason is that for each pixel, we are iterating over its neighboring pixels.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, as we need to store the smoothed image.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating over each pixel and its neighboring pixels. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the smoothed image.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal in terms of time complexity, as we need to visit each pixel at least once to calculate the average of neighboring pixels.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty 2D array `smoothed` with the same dimensions as the input image `M`.
  2. Iterate over each pixel `(i, j)` in the input image `M`.
  3. For each pixel, calculate the sum of neighboring pixels and count the number of neighboring pixels.
  4. Calculate the average of neighboring pixels by dividing the sum by the count.
  5. Assign the average value to the corresponding pixel in the `smoothed` array.
- Proof of optimality: The time complexity of the brute force approach is already optimal, as we need to visit each pixel at least once to calculate the average of neighboring pixels.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> imageSmoother(vector<vector<int>>& M) {
    int m = M.size();
    int n = M[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> smoothed(m, vector<int>(n));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int sum = 0;
            int count = 0;
            for (int x = max(0, i-1); x <= min(m-1, i+1); x++) {
                for (int y = max(0, j-1); y <= min(n-1, j+1); y++) {
                    sum += M[x][y];
                    count++;
                }
            }
            smoothed[i][j] = sum / count;
        }
    }
    return smoothed;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration over 2D arrays, calculation of averages, and handling of edge cases.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems, using iteration to solve each sub-problem, and combining the solutions to solve the original problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, as the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Image processing problems, such as blurring or sharpening images.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to handle edge cases, using incorrect indexing, or dividing by zero.
- Edge cases to watch for: Pixels located at the boundary of the image, which may not have all nine neighboring pixels.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient data structures or algorithms, such as using a linked list to store the image pixels.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input images, including edge cases, to ensure that it produces the correct output.
