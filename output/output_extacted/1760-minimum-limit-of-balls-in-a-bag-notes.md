## Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-limit-of-balls-in-a-bag/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: You are given an integer array `nums` where each integer represents the number of balls in a bag. There are `m` operations to be performed. In each operation, you can increase the number of balls in a bag by `1` to make the total number of balls in the bag a perfect square. Find the minimum number of operations required to make all bags have a perfect square number of balls.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations required.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input array `nums` can have any positive integer values, and `m` is not relevant in this problem.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if `nums = [2,6,8]`, the minimum number of operations required is `3` because we can make the number of balls in each bag a perfect square by performing the following operations: `2 -> 4`, `6 -> 9`, and `8 -> 9`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward approach is to try all possible perfect squares for each bag and calculate the number of operations required to reach each perfect square.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: For each bag, find all perfect squares that are greater than or equal to the number of balls in the bag. Then, for each perfect square, calculate the number of operations required to reach that perfect square. Finally, find the minimum number of operations required among all perfect squares.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is intuitive because it considers all possible perfect squares for each bag and tries to find the minimum number of operations required.

```cpp
int minimumLimit(vector<int>& nums) {
    int res = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        int sq = sqrt(num);
        while (sq * sq < num) {
            sq++;
        }
        res += sq * sq - num;
    }
    return res;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \sqrt{max\_num})$, where $n$ is the number of bags and $max\_num$ is the maximum number of balls in a bag. The reason is that we iterate over each bag and for each bag, we find the next perfect square.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, which means the space required does not grow with the size of the input array, making it very efficient in terms of memory usage.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we iterate over each bag and for each bag, we find the next perfect square. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the result and other variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a mathematical approach to find the next perfect square for each bag. We can use the `sqrt` function to find the square root of the number of balls in each bag and then round up to the nearest integer to find the next perfect square.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: For each bag, find the square root of the number of balls in the bag using the `sqrt` function. Then, round up to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function. Finally, calculate the number of operations required to reach the next perfect square.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a mathematical approach to find the next perfect square for each bag, which is the most efficient way to solve the problem.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we are using the most efficient mathematical approach to find the next perfect square for each bag.

```cpp
int minimumLimit(vector<int>& nums) {
    int res = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        int sq = ceil(sqrt(num));
        res += sq * sq - num;
    }
    return res;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of bags. The reason is that we iterate over each bag and for each bag, we find the next perfect square using a constant time mathematical operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, which means the space required does not grow with the size of the input array, making it very efficient in terms of memory usage.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because we are using a constant time mathematical operation to find the next perfect square for each bag. The space complexity is also optimal because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the result and other variables.
