## Replace Employee ID with the Unique Identifier
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-employee-id-with-the-unique-identifier/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves replacing employee IDs in a table with their corresponding unique identifiers.
- Expected output format: The output should be a table where each employee ID is replaced by its unique identifier.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where an employee ID does not have a unique identifier.
- Example test cases with explanations: For instance, given a table with employee IDs and their corresponding unique identifiers, the task is to replace the employee IDs in another table with these unique identifiers.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through each row in the table that needs the employee IDs replaced and for each ID, find its unique identifier from the other table.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a lookup table or dictionary that maps employee IDs to their unique identifiers for efficient lookup.
  2. Iterate through each row in the table that needs the IDs replaced.
  3. For each employee ID found, use the lookup table to find its unique identifier and replace the ID with this identifier.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward method that involves directly addressing each ID and replacing it based on a lookup.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

struct Employee {
    int id;
    int uniqueId;
};

std::vector<int> replaceEmployeeId(std::vector<int>& employeeIds, std::vector<Employee>& uniqueIdentifiers) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> lookup;
    for (const auto& employee : uniqueIdentifiers) {
        lookup[employee.id] = employee.uniqueId;
    }
    
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int id : employeeIds) {
        if (lookup.find(id) != lookup.end()) {
            result.push_back(lookup[id]);
        } else {
            // Handle the case where the ID does not have a unique identifier
            result.push_back(-1); // Assuming -1 as a placeholder for not found
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ where $n$ is the number of employee IDs to replace and $m$ is the number of unique identifiers. This is because we iterate through the unique identifiers once to create the lookup table and then through the employee IDs to replace them.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$ for storing the lookup table.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The iteration through the data and the creation of the lookup table dictate these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Utilizing a database or a data structure that supports efficient lookup, such as a hash table (unordered_map in C++), to map employee IDs to their unique identifiers. This approach is already presented in the brute force solution but is indeed the optimal way to solve this problem given the requirement for efficient replacement of IDs.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same as the brute force approach since it's already optimal for this scenario.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to replace the IDs. Looking up an ID in a hash table takes constant time on average, making the overall time complexity linear with respect to the total number of IDs and unique identifiers.

```cpp
// The code remains the same as in the brute force approach since it's already optimal
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ where $n$ is the number of employee IDs to replace and $m$ is the number of unique identifiers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$ for storing the lookup table.
> - **Optimality proof:** The linearity of the time complexity with respect to the input sizes and the use of a hash table for efficient lookup make this solution optimal for replacing employee IDs with their unique identifiers.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Efficient lookup using hash tables.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Creating a lookup table for fast replacement.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minimizing the number of operations by using data structures that support constant time lookup.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving efficient replacement or lookup in data.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling cases where an employee ID does not have a unique identifier.
- Edge cases to watch for: IDs without unique identifiers, empty input, etc.
- Performance pitfalls: Using data structures that do not support efficient lookup, such as linear search in an array.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various inputs, including edge cases like empty tables or IDs without unique identifiers.
