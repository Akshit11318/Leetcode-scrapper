## Group By
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/group-by/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves writing a SQL query to group a table by a specific column and apply an aggregate function to another column.
- Expected output format: The query should return the grouped results with the aggregate function applied.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The query should handle cases where the input table is empty or contains duplicate values.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: 
    - Input: 
      ```sql
      +----+-------+
      | id | score |
      +----+-------+
      | 1  | 3.5   |
      | 2  | 3.65  |
      | 1  | 2.85  |
      | 3  | 2.7   |
      +----+-------+
      ```
    - Output: 
      ```sql
      +----+-------+
      | id | score |
      +----+-------+
      | 1  | 3.1   |
      | 2  | 3.65  |
      | 3  | 2.7   |
      +----+-------+
      ```
    - Explanation: The query groups the table by the `id` column and calculates the average `score` for each group.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to use a simple SQL query with the `GROUP BY` clause and the `AVG` function to calculate the average score for each group.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Select the `id` column and the `score` column from the table.
  2. Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by the `id` column.
  3. Use the `AVG` function to calculate the average `score` for each group.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This is the most straightforward way to solve the problem, as it directly addresses the requirements of grouping by a specific column and applying an aggregate function to another column.

```sql
SELECT id, AVG(score) AS score
FROM Scores
GROUP BY id
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the table, because we need to iterate over each row to calculate the average score for each group.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we need to store the results for each group.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we need to iterate over each row in the table and store the results for each group.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach, as the `GROUP BY` clause and the `AVG` function are the most efficient way to solve this problem in SQL.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Select the `id` column and the `score` column from the table.
  2. Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by the `id` column.
  3. Use the `AVG` function to calculate the average `score` for each group.
- Proof of optimality: This is the most efficient way to solve the problem in SQL, as it uses the built-in `GROUP BY` and `AVG` functions, which are optimized for performance.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because the `GROUP BY` and `AVG` functions are already optimized for performance, and any additional optimization would require a different approach that would likely be less efficient.

```sql
SELECT id, AVG(score) AS score
FROM Scores
GROUP BY id
```

> Complexity Analysis:

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The `GROUP BY` clause and the `AVG` function are used to group a table by a specific column and calculate the average value for another column.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires the use of aggregate functions and grouping to solve.
- Optimization techniques learned: The use of built-in SQL functions, such as `GROUP BY` and `AVG`, can optimize performance.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve grouping and aggregate functions, such as calculating the sum or count of values in a group.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to include the `GROUP BY` clause or using the wrong aggregate function.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where the input table is empty or contains duplicate values.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient SQL queries that can lead to performance issues.
- Testing considerations: Testing the query with different input data to ensure it produces the correct results.
