## Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/delivering-boxes-from-storage-to-ports/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `boxes`, `portsCount`, `maxBoxes`, `maxWeight`
- Constraints: 
  - `1 <= boxes.length <= 10^5`
  - `1 <= portsCount <= 10^5`
  - `1 <= maxBoxes <= 10^5`
  - `1 <= maxWeight <= 10^5`
- Expected output: The minimum number of operations to deliver all boxes.
- Key requirements:
  - Each box can be delivered to any port.
  - Each port can receive at most `maxBoxes` boxes and `maxWeight` total weight.
- Example test cases:
  - `boxes = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]`, `portsCount = 2`, `maxBoxes = 4`, `maxWeight = 10`
  - `boxes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `portsCount = 1`, `maxBoxes = 5`, `maxWeight = 15`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible assignments of boxes to ports.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all permutations of assigning boxes to ports.
  2. For each permutation, check if the constraints are met.
  3. If constraints are met, calculate the number of operations needed.
  4. Keep track of the minimum number of operations across all valid permutations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int bruteForce(vector<int>& boxes, int portsCount, int maxBoxes, int maxWeight) {
    int n = boxes.size();
    int minOperations = INT_MAX;
    vector<int> portBoxes(portsCount, 0);
    vector<int> portWeights(portsCount, 0);

    // Generate all permutations
    do {
        // Reset port assignments
        fill(portBoxes.begin(), portBoxes.end(), 0);
        fill(portWeights.begin(), portWeights.end(), 0);

        // Assign boxes to ports
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Find a port that can take the box
            bool assigned = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < portsCount; j++) {
                if (portBoxes[j] < maxBoxes && portWeights[j] + boxes[i] <= maxWeight) {
                    portBoxes[j]++;
                    portWeights[j] += boxes[i];
                    assigned = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!assigned) break; // Can't assign the box
        }

        // If all boxes are assigned, calculate operations
        if (assigned) {
            int operations = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < portsCount; i++) {
                operations += (portBoxes[i] > 0);
            }
            minOperations = min(minOperations, operations);
        }
    } while (next_permutation(boxes.begin(), boxes.end()));

    return minOperations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n! \cdot n \cdot portsCount)$, where $n$ is the number of boxes, due to generating all permutations and checking each permutation against the constraints.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(portsCount)$ for the port assignments.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible assignments of boxes to ports and checking each assignment against the constraints, leading to high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Use a greedy approach to assign boxes to ports based on their weights.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Sort the boxes by their weights in descending order.
  2. Assign each box to the first port that has enough capacity and weight limit.
  3. If no port has enough capacity, open a new port.

```cpp
int boxDelivering(vector<int>& boxes, int portsCount, int maxBoxes, int maxWeight) {
    int n = boxes.size();
    sort(boxes.rbegin(), boxes.rend()); // Sort boxes by weight in descending order

    int operations = 0;
    vector<int> portBoxes(portsCount, 0);
    vector<int> portWeights(portsCount, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        bool assigned = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < portsCount; j++) {
            if (portBoxes[j] < maxBoxes && portWeights[j] + boxes[i] <= maxWeight) {
                portBoxes[j]++;
                portWeights[j] += boxes[i];
                assigned = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!assigned) {
            operations++;
            portBoxes[operations - 1]++;
            portWeights[operations - 1] += boxes[i];
        }
    }

    return operations + (operations < portsCount);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + n \cdot portsCount)$, where $n$ is the number of boxes, due to sorting the boxes and assigning them to ports.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(portsCount)$ for the port assignments.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it assigns the heaviest boxes first, minimizing the number of operations needed to deliver all boxes.
