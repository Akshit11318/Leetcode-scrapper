## Cutting Ribbons
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/cutting-ribbons/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of integers `ribbons` where `ribbons[i]` represents the length of the `i-th` ribbon, and an integer `k` representing the number of cuts. Each cut operation can cut a ribbon into two smaller pieces. The goal is to maximize the minimum length of the ribbons after `k` cuts.
- Expected output format: The maximum minimum length of the ribbons after `k` cuts.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The number of cuts `k` must be at least the number of ribbons minus one. The length of each ribbon is a positive integer.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `ribbons = [9,7,5], k = 3`
    - Output: `5`
    - Explanation: After the first cut, the ribbon of length 9 is cut into two pieces of lengths 4 and 5. After the second cut, the ribbon of length 7 is cut into two pieces of lengths 3 and 4. After the third cut, the ribbon of length 5 is cut into two pieces of lengths 2 and 3. The minimum length of the ribbons after the cuts is `3`.
  - Input: `ribbons = [7,5,9], k = 4`
    - Output: `4`
    - Explanation: After the first cut, the ribbon of length 9 is cut into two pieces of lengths 4 and 5. After the second cut, the ribbon of length 7 is cut into two pieces of lengths 3 and 4. After the third cut, the ribbon of length 5 is cut into two pieces of lengths 2 and 3. After the fourth cut, the ribbon of length 4 is cut into two pieces of lengths 2 and 2. The minimum length of the ribbons after the cuts is `2`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of cuts for each ribbon.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a list to store the minimum length of the ribbons after each cut.
  2. Iterate over each possible length of cut for the first ribbon.
  3. For each possible length of cut, iterate over each possible length of cut for the second ribbon, and so on.
  4. After all cuts have been made, calculate the minimum length of the ribbons.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible combinations of cuts.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLength(vector<int>& ribbons, int k) {
        int n = ribbons.size();
        vector<int> min_length(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            min_length[i] = ribbons[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int max_index = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (min_length[j] > min_length[max_index]) {
                    max_index = j;
                }
            }
            min_length[max_index] /= 2;
        }
        int min = min_length[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (min_length[i] < min) {
                min = min_length[i];
            }
        }
        return min;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n)$ where $k$ is the number of cuts and $n$ is the number of ribbons.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of ribbons.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating over each possible length of cut for each ribbon, and the space complexity occurs because we are storing the minimum length of each ribbon after each cut.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use binary search to find the maximum minimum length of the ribbons after `k` cuts.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the low and high bounds for the binary search.
  2. Calculate the number of cuts required for each possible length of cut.
  3. If the number of cuts required is less than or equal to `k`, update the low bound.
  4. If the number of cuts required is greater than `k`, update the high bound.
- Proof of optimality: The binary search approach ensures that we find the maximum minimum length of the ribbons after `k` cuts in the minimum number of iterations.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The binary search approach has a time complexity of $O(n \log m)$ where $n$ is the number of ribbons and $m$ is the maximum length of a ribbon, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLength(vector<int>& ribbons, int k) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = 0;
        for (int ribbon : ribbons) {
            high = max(high, ribbon);
        }
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low + 1) / 2;
            int cuts = 0;
            for (int ribbon : ribbons) {
                cuts += (ribbon - 1) / mid;
            }
            if (cuts <= k) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Binary search, iterative approach.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using binary search to find the maximum minimum length of the ribbons after `k` cuts.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using binary search to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding the maximum minimum length of a set of objects after a certain number of operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the low and high bounds correctly, not updating the low and high bounds correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where `k` is equal to the number of ribbons minus one, the case where the length of a ribbon is equal to one.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach instead of a binary search approach.
- Testing considerations: Testing the algorithm with different inputs, including edge cases and large inputs.
