**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-height-of-a-triangle/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Three integers representing the lengths of three line segments.
- Constraints: $0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9$.
- Expected Output: The maximum possible height of a triangle that can be formed using these three line segments.
- Key Requirements: The three line segments must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
- Edge Cases: If the three line segments cannot form a triangle, the output should be 0.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `a = 5, b = 3, c = 7`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the maximum possible height of a triangle that can be formed using the given three line segments.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Check if the three line segments can form a triangle by verifying the triangle inequality theorem.
  2. If the line segments can form a triangle, calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle using the formula $s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}$.
  3. Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula: $A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$.
  4. Calculate the maximum possible height of the triangle using the formula $h = \frac{2A}{a}$, $h = \frac{2A}{b}$, and $h = \frac{2A}{c}$, and return the maximum value.

```cpp
int maximumHeight(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Check if the three line segments can form a triangle
    if (a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle
    double s = (a + b + c) / 2.0;

    // Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula
    double A = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));

    // Calculate the maximum possible height of the triangle
    double h1 = (2 * A) / a;
    double h2 = (2 * A) / b;
    double h3 = (2 * A) / c;

    // Return the maximum height
    return (int)fmax(fmax(h1, h2), h3);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the solution involves a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the solution uses a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The solution involves a fixed number of calculations, and the space usage does not grow with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The maximum possible height of a triangle can be calculated using the formula $h = \frac{2A}{a}$, $h = \frac{2A}{b}$, and $h = \frac{2A}{c}$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Check if the three line segments can form a triangle by verifying the triangle inequality theorem.
  2. If the line segments can form a triangle, calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle using the formula $s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}$.
  3. Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula: $A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$.
  4. Calculate the maximum possible height of the triangle using the formula $h = \frac{2A}{a}$, $h = \frac{2A}{b}$, and $h = \frac{2A}{c}$, and return the maximum value.

```cpp
int maximumHeight(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Check if the three line segments can form a triangle
    if (a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle
    double s = (a + b + c) / 2.0;

    // Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula
    double A = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));

    // Calculate the maximum possible height of the triangle
    double h1 = (2 * A) / a;
    double h2 = (2 * A) / b;
    double h3 = (2 * A) / c;

    // Return the maximum height
    return (int)fmax(fmax(h1, h2), h3);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the solution involves a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the solution uses a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution calculates the maximum possible height of a triangle using the given three line segments, and it is impossible to achieve a higher height.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: triangle inequality theorem, Heron's formula, and calculation of the maximum possible height of a triangle.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: checking if the line segments can form a triangle, calculating the semi-perimeter and area of the triangle, and calculating the maximum possible height.
- Optimization techniques learned: using Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle and calculating the maximum possible height using the formula $h = \frac{2A}{a}$, $h = \frac{2A}{b}$, and $h = \frac{2A}{c}$.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking if the line segments can form a triangle, not calculating the semi-perimeter and area of the triangle correctly, and not calculating the maximum possible height correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: when the line segments cannot form a triangle, and when the input values are very large or very small.
- Performance pitfalls: using a slow algorithm to calculate the area of the triangle, and not optimizing the calculation of the maximum possible height.
- Testing considerations: testing the solution with different input values, including edge cases, to ensure that it produces the correct output.
