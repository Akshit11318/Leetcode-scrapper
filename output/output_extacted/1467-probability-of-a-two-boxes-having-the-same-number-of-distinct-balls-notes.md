## Probability of a Two Boxes Having the Same Number of Distinct Balls

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/probability-of-a-two-boxes-having-the-same-number-of-distinct-balls/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two arrays `balls` of size `n` representing the number of balls in each box, where `balls[i]` is the number of balls of type `i`.
- Constraints: `1 <= balls.length <= 8`, `1 <= balls[i] <= 5`, and `1 <= sum(balls) <= 40`.
- Expected Output: The probability that two boxes have the same number of distinct balls.
- Key Requirements:
  - Calculate all possible distributions of balls into two boxes.
  - For each distribution, calculate the number of distinct balls in each box.
  - Calculate the probability of having the same number of distinct balls in both boxes.
- Edge Cases:
  - Handling cases where the total number of balls is odd or even.
  - Ensuring all possible distributions are considered.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to generate all possible distributions of balls into two boxes and then calculate the probability.
- This involves iterating through all possible combinations of ball distributions and counting the favorable outcomes (where both boxes have the same number of distinct balls).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

double getProbability(vector<int>& balls) {
    double totalOutcomes = 1;
    for (int ball : balls) {
        totalOutcomes *= (ball + 1);
    }

    double favorableOutcomes = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << balls.size()); mask++) {
        vector<int> box1, box2;
        for (int i = 0; i < balls.size(); i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                box1.push_back(i);
            } else {
                box2.push_back(i);
            }
        }

        set<int> distinctBox1, distinctBox2;
        for (int ball : box1) {
            distinctBox1.insert(ball);
        }
        for (int ball : box2) {
            distinctBox2.insert(ball);
        }

        if (distinctBox1.size() == distinctBox2.size()) {
            double probability = 1;
            for (int ball : balls) {
                probability *= (ball + 1);
            }
            favorableOutcomes += probability;
        }
    }

    return favorableOutcomes / totalOutcomes;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of types of balls. This is because we generate all possible subsets of the balls and for each subset, we calculate the number of distinct balls.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the subsets and the number of distinct balls in each subset.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we generate all possible subsets of the balls, which is $2^n$. For each subset, we calculate the number of distinct balls, which takes $O(n)$ time. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the subsets and the number of distinct balls in each subset.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the probability.
- Instead of generating all possible distributions of balls into two boxes, we can use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the probability.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

double getProbability(vector<int>& balls) {
    double totalWays = 1;
    for (int ball : balls) {
        totalWays *= (ball + 1);
    }

    map<int, double> ways;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << balls.size()); mask++) {
        int distinct = 0;
        double currWays = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < balls.size(); i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                distinct++;
                currWays *= balls[i];
            } else {
                currWays *= 1;
            }
        }

        ways[distinct] += currWays;
    }

    double prob = 0;
    for (auto& pair : ways) {
        prob += (pair.second * pair.second) / totalWays;
    }

    return prob;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the number of ways to get each number of distinct balls.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the probability, which reduces the number of calculations needed. The time complexity is still $O(2^n \cdot n)$, but the space complexity is reduced to $O(n)$.
