## Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-stay-in-the-same-place-after-some-steps/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes two integers, `steps` and `arrLen`, where `steps` represents the number of steps to be taken and `arrLen` represents the length of the array. The constraints are $1 \leq \text{steps} \leq 500$ and $1 \leq \text{arrLen} \leq 1000$.
- Expected output format: The expected output is the number of ways to stay in the same place after some steps.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The key requirement is to find the number of ways to stay in the same place after some steps. The edge cases to consider are when `steps` is odd or even, and when `arrLen` is 1.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `steps = 3` and `arrLen = 2`, the output is 4 because there are 4 ways to stay in the same place after 3 steps: `0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0`, `1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1`, and `1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0`.
  - For `steps = 2` and `arrLen = 4`, the output is 2 because there are 2 ways to stay in the same place after 2 steps: `0 -> 0 -> 0` and `1 -> 1 -> 1`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The initial thought process is to generate all possible sequences of steps and count the number of ways to stay in the same place.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible sequences of steps.
  2. For each sequence, check if the final position is the same as the initial position.
  3. If it is, increment the count.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach comes to mind first because it is a straightforward and intuitive way to solve the problem.

```cpp
int numWays(int steps, int arrLen) {
    int count = 0;
    // Generate all possible sequences of steps
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << steps); i++) {
        int pos = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < steps; j++) {
            if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                pos++;
            } else {
                pos--;
            }
            if (pos < 0 || pos >= arrLen) {
                break;
            }
        }
        if (pos == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{\text{steps}})$ because we generate all possible sequences of steps.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store the count.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we use a brute force approach that generates all possible sequences of steps.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use dynamic programming to store the number of ways to reach each position at each step.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a 2D array `dp` of size `steps + 1` x `arrLen` to store the number of ways to reach each position at each step.
  2. Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1` because there is one way to reach position 0 at step 0.
  3. For each step from 1 to `steps`, for each position from 0 to `arrLen - 1`, calculate `dp[i][j]` as the sum of `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` and `dp[i - 1][j + 1]` if `j - 1` and `j + 1` are within the bounds of the array.
  4. Return `dp[steps][0]` as the number of ways to stay in the same place after `steps` steps.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses dynamic programming to store the number of ways to reach each position at each step, avoiding redundant calculations.

```cpp
int numWays(int steps, int arrLen) {
    const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    vector<vector<int>> dp(steps + 1, vector<int>(arrLen, 0));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= steps; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arrLen; j++) {
            if (j > 0) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
            }
            if (j < arrLen - 1) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j + 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[steps][0];
}
```

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, memoization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using dynamic programming to store the number of ways to reach each position at each step.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding redundant calculations using dynamic programming.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the Fibonacci sequence or the longest common subsequence.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the base case correctly, not handling edge cases correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `steps` is odd or even, when `arrLen` is 1.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that generates all possible sequences of steps.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, such as different values of `steps` and `arrLen`.
