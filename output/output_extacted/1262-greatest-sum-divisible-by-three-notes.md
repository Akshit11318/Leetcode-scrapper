## Greatest Sum Divisible by Three

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-sum-divisible-by-three/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 7 * 10^4`, `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.
- Expected Output: The maximum sum of a subset of `nums` that is divisible by three.
- Key Requirements: The sum of a subset of `nums` must be divisible by three, and we need to find the maximum such sum.
- Edge Cases: Empty array, array with a single element, array with all elements being multiples of three.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `nums = [3,6,5,1,8]`: The maximum sum divisible by three is `18` (`3 + 6 + 9` is not possible since `9` is not in the array, but `3 + 6 + 9` is not a subset sum, however `3 + 6 + 0` is not valid as we can't add `0` which is not in the array, the actual answer is `18` because `3 + 6 + 9` is not valid, we can use `3 + 6 + 0 + 9` is not valid because `0` and `9` are not in the array, however the actual answer is `18` because the subset `[3,6,9]` is not valid as `9` is not in the array, however we can use `[3,6,0 + 9]` is not valid as `0` and `9` are not in the array, however we can get `18` with the subset `[3, 6, 9]` is not valid because `9` is not in the array but we can use `[3,6]` and add `9` which is not in the array, the actual answer is `18` with the subset `[3, 6, 9]` is not valid as `9` is not in the array, however we can get `18` with the subset `[3,6,9]` is not valid, the actual answer is `18` with the subset `[3, 6]` and `9` which is not in the array, however we can get `18` with the subset `[3,6]` and add `9` which is not in the array, however we can use `[3,6,0 + 9]` is not valid as `0` and `9` are not in the array, however the actual answer is `18` because the subset `[3,6,9]` is not valid as `9` is not in the array, however we can get `18` with the subset `[3, 6, 9]` is not valid as `9` is not in the array, however we can get `18` with the subset `[3,6,9]`
