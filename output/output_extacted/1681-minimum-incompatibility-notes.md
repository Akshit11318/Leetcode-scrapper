## Minimum Incompatibility
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-incompatibility/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 16`, `1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length`, and all elements of `nums` are in the range `[1, nums.length]`.
- Expected Output: The minimum incompatibility.
- Key Requirements: To find the minimum incompatibility by dividing the array into `k` non-empty groups such that the sum of the maximum values in each group is minimized.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `nums = [1, 2, 1, 2], k = 2` returns `4`.
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], k = 3` returns `27`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process is to generate all possible combinations of `k` non-empty groups from the array `nums`.
- Then, for each combination, calculate the sum of the maximum values in each group.
- Finally, return the minimum sum among all combinations.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem by considering all possible ways to divide the array into `k` groups.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int minimumIncompatibility(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<vector<int>> groups(k);
    vector<bool> used(n, false);
    int result = INT_MAX;
    
    function<void(int)> backtrack = [&](int index) {
        if (index == n) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (auto& group : groups) {
                if (group.empty()) return;
                int maxVal = *max_element(group.begin(), group.end());
                sum += maxVal;
            }
            result = min(result, sum);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (groups[i].empty() || groups[i].back() != nums[index]) {
                groups[i].push_back(nums[index]);
                backtrack(index + 1);
                groups[i].pop_back();
            }
        }
    };
    
    backtrack(0);
    return result == INT_MAX ? -1 : result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n \cdot n! / (k! \cdot (n-k)!))$ due to generating all combinations and checking each one.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the groups and the used array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates all possible combinations of `k` non-empty groups from the array `nums`, leading to a high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight is to use a bitmask to represent the groups and use a recursive function to try all possible assignments of numbers to groups.
- The bitmask `mask` is used to track which numbers have been assigned to a group.
- The `groups` array is used to store the maximum value in each group.
- The recursive function tries to assign each unassigned number to a group and updates the `groups` array accordingly.
- If all numbers have been assigned, the function returns the sum of the maximum values in each group.

```cpp
int minimumIncompatibility(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    vector<int> count(n + 1, 0);
    for (int num : nums) count[num]++;
    if (*max_element(count.begin(), count.end()) > k) return -1;
    
    int result = INT_MAX;
    vector<int> groups(k, INT_MIN);
    function<void(int, int)> backtrack = [&](int index, int mask) {
        if (index == n) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                if (groups[i] == INT_MIN) return;
                sum += groups[i];
            }
            result = min(result, sum);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (groups[i] == INT_MIN || groups[i] == nums[index]) {
                groups[i] = max(groups[i], nums[index]);
                backtrack(index + 1, mask | (1 << i));
                groups[i] = (groups[i] == nums[index] ? INT_MIN : groups[i]);
            }
        }
    };
    
    backtrack(0, 0);
    return result == INT_MAX ? -1 : result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot 2^k \cdot n)$ due to the recursive function and the bitmask.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$ for storing the groups array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it tries all possible assignments of numbers to groups and returns the minimum sum of the maximum values in each group.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: bitmask, recursive function, and dynamic programming.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: trying all possible assignments and using a bitmask to track the assignments.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a recursive function to try all possible assignments and using a bitmask to reduce the search space.
- Similar problems to practice: problems that involve trying all possible assignments and using a bitmask to track the assignments.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking if a number has been assigned to a group before assigning it to another group.
- Edge cases to watch for: when the input array is empty or when the number of groups is greater than the number of elements in the array.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach that tries all possible combinations of `k` non-empty groups from the array `nums`.
- Testing considerations: testing the function with different inputs and edge cases to ensure it works correctly.
