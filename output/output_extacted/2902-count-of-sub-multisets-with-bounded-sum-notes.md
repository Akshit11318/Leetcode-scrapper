## Count of Sub-Multisets with Bounded Sum

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-sub-multisets-with-bounded-sum/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a non-empty integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of submultisets of `nums` with a sum that is less than or equal to `k`.
- A submultiset is a subset that can contain duplicate elements from the original set.
- Input format: An array of integers and an integer `k`.
- Expected output format: The count of submultisets with a sum less than or equal to `k`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling duplicate elements.
  - Ensuring the sum of the submultiset does not exceed `k`.
  - Counting all possible submultisets, including the empty set.
- Example test cases:
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 4` should return `6`, because the possible submultisets are: `[], [1], [2], [1,1], [2,2], [1,2]`.
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 5` should return `9`, considering all submultisets with sums not exceeding `5`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves generating all possible submultisets of the given array and then checking the sum of each submultiset.
- This approach involves using recursion or iteration to generate all possible combinations of elements, including duplicates, and then filtering those combinations based on their sum.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the requirement of considering all possible submultisets without immediately optimizing for performance.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSubMultisets(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Generate all possible submultisets
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    sum += nums[i];
                }
            }
            if (sum <= k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`. The outer loop runs $2^n$ times (for each possible subset), and the inner loop runs $n$ times (to calculate the sum of the current subset).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and the current sum.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inherently exponential in time due to generating all possible subsets, and it is linear in space because we only need to keep track of the current subset's sum and the total count.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach involves using dynamic programming to efficiently count the number of submultisets with a sum less than or equal to `k`.
- We create a DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of submultisets of the first `i` elements with a sum less than or equal to `j`.
- We iterate through each element in `nums` and for each possible sum from `0` to `k`, we update `dp[i][j]` by considering whether to include the current element in the submultiset or not.
- This approach optimally solves the problem by avoiding the exponential time complexity of the brute force approach.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSubMultisets(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(nums.size() + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1; // The empty set has a sum of 0
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= nums.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                // If the current element's value is greater than the current sum, we cannot include it
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                if (j >= nums[i - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - nums[i - 1]];
                }
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
            count += dp[nums.size()][j];
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums` and $k$ is the given sum limit.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, for the DP array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses dynamic programming to efficiently count the submultisets in a bottom-up manner, avoiding the need to explicitly generate all subsets and thus reducing the time complexity significantly.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Dynamic programming can be used to efficiently solve problems involving counting subsets or submultisets with certain properties.
- The key to solving such problems is to define a suitable DP state and transition, which allows for the efficient computation of the desired count.
- Optimization techniques, such as using a DP array to store intermediate results, can significantly reduce the time complexity of the solution.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the use of dynamic programming for problems that involve counting or optimizing over subsets or submultisets.
- Failing to define a clear and efficient DP state and transition, leading to incorrect or inefficient solutions.
- Not optimizing the space complexity of the solution, especially for large inputs.
