## Leetcodify Similar Friends

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/leetcodify-similar-friends/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A list of strings `interests` and a list of integers `friend` representing friend IDs.
- Constraints: $1 \leq \text{number of friends} \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq \text{length of each interest} \leq 10$.
- Expected output format: A list of pairs of friend IDs who have the most similar interests.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where there are multiple pairs with the same maximum similarity, and ensuring the output is sorted in ascending order by friend ID.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `interests = ["a", "b", "c"], friends = [1, 2, 3]`
  - Example 2: `interests = ["abc", "bcd", "cde"], friends = [1, 2, 3]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Compare each pair of friends and calculate the similarity of their interests by counting the common characters.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible pairs of friend IDs.
  2. For each pair, calculate the similarity of their interests by iterating over the characters in the interests and counting the common ones.
  3. Keep track of the maximum similarity and the corresponding pairs of friend IDs.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement and is straightforward to implement.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> leetcodifySimilarFriends(vector<string>& interests, vector<int>& friends) {
    int n = friends.size();
    vector<vector<int>> maxSimilarityPairs;
    int maxSimilarity = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            int similarity = 0;
            for (char c : interests[i]) {
                if (interests[j].find(c) != string::npos) {
                    similarity++;
                }
            }

            if (similarity > maxSimilarity) {
                maxSimilarity = similarity;
                maxSimilarityPairs.clear();
                maxSimilarityPairs.push_back({friends[i], friends[j]});
            } else if (similarity == maxSimilarity) {
                maxSimilarityPairs.push_back({friends[i], friends[j]});
            }
        }
    }

    sort(maxSimilarityPairs.begin(), maxSimilarityPairs.end());
    return maxSimilarityPairs;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \times m)$, where $n$ is the number of friends and $m$ is the maximum length of an interest. This is because we are generating all pairs of friends and for each pair, we are iterating over the characters in the interests.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, as we are storing all pairs of friends with the maximum similarity.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time and space complexities due to the nested loops and the storage of all pairs of friends.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a `unordered_map` to store the frequency of each character in the interests, and then calculate the similarity by iterating over the characters in one interest and checking if they exist in the other interest.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a `unordered_map` to store the frequency of each character in the interests.
  2. Generate all possible pairs of friend IDs.
  3. For each pair, calculate the similarity of their interests by iterating over the characters in one interest and checking if they exist in the other interest using the `unordered_map`.
  4. Keep track of the maximum similarity and the corresponding pairs of friend IDs.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a lower time complexity than the brute force approach because it uses a `unordered_map` to store the frequency of each character, allowing for faster lookups.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> leetcodifySimilarFriends(vector<string>& interests, vector<int>& friends) {
    int n = friends.size();
    vector<vector<int>> maxSimilarityPairs;
    int maxSimilarity = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            unordered_map<char, int> freq;
            for (char c : interests[i]) {
                freq[c]++;
            }

            int similarity = 0;
            for (char c : interests[j]) {
                if (freq.find(c) != freq.end()) {
                    similarity++;
                }
            }

            if (similarity > maxSimilarity) {
                maxSimilarity = similarity;
                maxSimilarityPairs.clear();
                maxSimilarityPairs.push_back({friends[i], friends[j]});
            } else if (similarity == maxSimilarity) {
                maxSimilarityPairs.push_back({friends[i], friends[j]});
            }
        }
    }

    sort(maxSimilarityPairs.begin(), maxSimilarityPairs.end());
    return maxSimilarityPairs;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \times m)$, where $n$ is the number of friends and $m$ is the maximum length of an interest. This is because we are generating all pairs of friends and for each pair, we are iterating over the characters in the interests.

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has the lowest possible time complexity for this problem, which is $O(n^2 \times m)$.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Using a `unordered_map` to store the frequency of each character, and generating all possible pairs of friend IDs.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems, and using a `unordered_map` to optimize the solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a `unordered_map` to store the frequency of each character, and iterating over the characters in one interest and checking if they exist in the other interest.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems that involve generating all possible pairs of elements and calculating the similarity between them.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases, such as when the input is empty or when there are multiple pairs with the same maximum similarity.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where there are multiple pairs with the same maximum similarity, and ensuring the output is sorted in ascending order by friend ID.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a `unordered_map` to store the frequency of each character, which can lead to a higher time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different inputs, such as empty inputs, inputs with multiple pairs with the same maximum similarity, and inputs with a large number of friends.
