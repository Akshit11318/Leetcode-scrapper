## Sort Linked List Already Sorted Using Absolute Values

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-linked-list-already-sorted-using-absolute-values/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given the head of a linked list where each node has a unique `abs(value)`, sort the linked list in ascending order by absolute value.
- Input format: The head of the linked list.
- Constraints: The number of nodes in the list is in the range $[1, 10^5]$ and each node has a unique absolute value.
- Expected output format: The head of the sorted linked list.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling negative numbers, ensuring uniqueness of absolute values, and maintaining the original linked list structure where possible.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `[2, -1, -4, 3]`, Expected Output: `[-1, -4, 2, 3]`
- Input: `[1, 2, 3]`, Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Input: `[-1, -2, -3]`, Expected Output: `[-1, -2, -3]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves sorting the linked list based on the absolute values of its nodes. 
- We can achieve this by first extracting all the values from the linked list, sorting them based on their absolute values, and then reconstructing the linked list with the sorted values.

```cpp
// Function to sort a linked list based on absolute values of its nodes
ListNode* sortList(ListNode* head) {
    vector<int> values;
    ListNode* current = head;
    
    // Extract all values from the linked list
    while (current != nullptr) {
        values.push_back(current->val);
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    // Sort the values based on their absolute values
    sort(values.begin(), values.end(), [](int a, int b) {
        return abs(a) < abs(b);
    });
    
    // Reconstruct the linked list with the sorted values
    current = head;
    for (int value : values) {
        current->val = value;
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    return head;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N \log N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is due to the sorting operation using `std::sort`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$, as we need to store all the values from the linked list in a vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The sorting operation dominates the time complexity, and storing all values in a vector for sorting contributes to the space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach involves directly comparing nodes in the linked list based on their absolute values and swapping them if necessary, without the need to extract all values into a separate data structure.
- This can be achieved by implementing a simple sorting algorithm like bubble sort or insertion sort directly on the linked list.

```cpp
// Function to sort a linked list based on absolute values of its nodes
ListNode* sortList(ListNode* head) {
    if (!head || !head->next) return head;
    
    bool swapped;
    do {
        swapped = false;
        ListNode* current = head;
        
        while (current->next) {
            if (abs(current->val) > abs(current->next->val)) {
                // Swap the values
                int temp = current->val;
                current->val = current->next->val;
                current->next->val = temp;
                swapped = true;
            }
            current = current->next;
        }
    } while (swapped);
    
    return head;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$ in the worst case, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because in each iteration, we potentially compare and swap every pair of adjacent nodes.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the current node and the swap flag.
> - **Optimality proof:** While this approach is not the most efficient in terms of time complexity, it is optimal in terms of space complexity. Further optimization in time complexity would require a more complex algorithm that still operates within the constraints of a linked list.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated include sorting and linked list manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified include the use of brute force and optimization techniques.
