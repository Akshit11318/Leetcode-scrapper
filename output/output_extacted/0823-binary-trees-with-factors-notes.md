## Binary Trees With Factors
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-trees-with-factors/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `a` representing the values of nodes.
- Constraints: The length of `a` is between 1 and 500, and each element is between 1 and 500.
- Expected output format: The number of possible binary trees that can be formed using the given array as node values, where each node value is a product of its two children's values.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input array may contain duplicate values, and the problem statement requires counting distinct binary trees.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For the input `[2, 4]`, the possible binary tree is `[4, [2]]`, where the root is 4 and the left child is 2. The output should be 1.
  - For the input `[2, 4, 5, 10]`, the possible binary trees are `[10, [2, [5]]]`, `[10, [4, [2, 5]]]`, `[10, [5, [2, 4]]]`, `[10, [2, [5, 4]]]`, and `[10, [4, [2, [5]]]]`. The output should be 5.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible binary trees and check each one to see if the node values are products of their children's values.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible binary trees using the given array as node values.
  2. For each binary tree, check if each node's value is a product of its two children's values.
  3. If a binary tree satisfies the condition, increment the count of possible binary trees.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach to generate all possible binary trees and check each one.

```cpp
int numFactoredBinaryTrees(vector<int>& a) {
    int n = a.size();
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    unordered_map<int, long long> dp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[a[i]] = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (a[i] % a[j] == 0) {
                int other = a[i] / a[j];
                if (dp.find(other) != dp.end()) {
                    dp[a[i]] = (dp[a[i]] + dp[a[j]] * dp[other]) % 1000000007;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    long long sum = 0;
    for (auto& it : dp) {
        sum = (sum + it.second) % 1000000007;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because we have two nested loops iterating over the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because we use an unordered map to store the dynamic programming values.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we have two nested loops, and the space complexity occurs because we use an unordered map to store the dynamic programming values.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use dynamic programming to store the number of possible binary trees for each node value.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the input array in ascending order.
  2. Initialize an unordered map `dp` to store the number of possible binary trees for each node value.
  3. Iterate over the sorted array, and for each node value, check if it can be factored into two smaller node values.
  4. If a node value can be factored, update the `dp` value for that node value.
  5. Finally, sum up all the `dp` values to get the total number of possible binary trees.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.

```cpp
int numFactoredBinaryTrees(vector<int>& a) {
    int n = a.size();
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    unordered_map<int, long long> dp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[a[i]] = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (a[i] % a[j] == 0) {
                int other = a[i] / a[j];
                if (dp.find(other) != dp.end()) {
                    dp[a[i]] = (dp[a[i]] + dp[a[j]] * dp[other]) % 1000000007;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    long long sum = 0;
    for (auto& it : dp) {
        sum = (sum + it.second) % 1000000007;
    }
    return sum;
}
```
