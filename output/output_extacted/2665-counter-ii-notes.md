## Counter II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/counter-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves creating a `Counter` class with methods to increment and get the current count.
- Expected output format: The output should be the current count after a series of increment and get operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The counter starts at 0 and should only increase by 1 for each increment operation.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - `Counter c; c.increment(); c.increment(); c.increment(); c.get();` should return 3.
    - `Counter c; c.increment(); c.get(); c.increment(); c.get();` should return 2.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The simplest approach is to have a single variable that keeps track of the current count and increments it each time the `increment` method is called.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
    2. For each `increment` operation, increment `count` by 1.
    3. For each `get` operation, return the current value of `count`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the requirements with minimal complexity.

```cpp
class Counter {
private:
    int count;
public:
    Counter() : count(0) {}
    void increment() {
        count++;
    }
    int get() {
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ for both `increment` and `get` operations, as they involve constant time operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The operations are straightforward and do not depend on the size of the input, leading to constant time and space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem does not require any complex data structures or algorithms; a simple counter variable suffices.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
    2. Implement the `increment` method to increment the counter by 1.
    3. Implement the `get` method to return the current counter value.
- Proof of optimality: Since the problem only involves basic increment and get operations, any solution would have at least the same time and space complexity as the brute force approach.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The operations are already in constant time, and the space usage is minimal, making further optimization unnecessary.

```cpp
class Counter {
private:
    int count;
public:
    Counter() : count(0) {}
    void increment() {
        count++;
    }
    int get() {
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ for both `increment` and `get` operations, as they involve constant time operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution is optimal because it achieves the minimum possible time and space complexity for the given problem.
