## Minimum Falling Path Sum II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D array `arr` representing a grid of integers.
- Constraints: The grid is non-empty, and the number of columns is equal to the number of rows, denoted as `n`. 
- Expected output format: The minimum falling path sum of the grid.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The path can only be constructed by moving either down or diagonally to an adjacent cell in the next row. The minimum falling path sum is the sum of the integers in the path with the smallest possible sum.

**Example Test Cases:**
- For input `[[100,-42,-46,-41],[31,97,10,-10],[-58,-51,82,89],[51,81,69,-51]]`, the output should be `-36`.
- For input `[[19,73],[80,14]]`, the output should be `112`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the minimum falling path sum, we can start from the top row and explore all possible paths down to the bottom row, keeping track of the sum of each path.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Define a recursive function that takes the current row and column as parameters.
  2. In the function, calculate the sum of the current cell and the minimum sum of the possible paths from the next row.
  3. Use backtracking to explore all possible paths and keep track of the minimum sum found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to explore all possible paths in the grid.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFallingPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dfs(arr, 0, j, dp);
        }
        int minSum = INT_MAX;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            minSum = min(minSum, dp[0][j]);
        }
        return minSum;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& arr, int i, int j, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        int n = arr.size();
        if (i == n - 1) {
            dp[i][j] = arr[i][j];
            return;
        }
        if (dp[i][j] != INT_MAX) return;
        dp[i][j] = arr[i][j];
        for (int k = max(0, j - 1); k <= min(n - 1, j + 1); k++) {
            dfs(arr, i + 1, k, dp);
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i + 1][k] + arr[i][j]);
        }
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$ due to the recursive function calls and the nested loops.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ for the `dp` table to store the minimum sums of the paths.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The recursive function calls lead to exponential time complexity, and the `dp` table requires quadratic space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of using recursive function calls, we can use dynamic programming to build up the `dp` table iteratively.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the `dp` table with the values of the first row.
  2. Iterate over the rows, starting from the second row.
  3. For each cell in the current row, calculate the minimum sum by considering the minimum sums of the cells in the previous row that can be reached.
  4. Update the `dp` table with the minimum sums calculated.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ and a space complexity of $O(n^2)$, which is optimal for this problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFallingPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        dp[0] = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int minSum = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = max(0, j - 1); k <= min(n - 1, j + 1); k++) {
                    minSum = min(minSum, dp[i - 1][k]);
                }
                dp[i][j] = minSum + arr[i][j];
            }
        }
        int minSum = INT_MAX;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            minSum = min(minSum, dp[n - 1][j]);
        }
        return minSum;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming and backtracking.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The use of recursive function calls and dynamic programming to solve problems with overlapping subproblems.
- Optimization techniques learned: The use of memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect initialization of the `dp` table, incorrect calculation of the minimum sums.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where the input grid is empty, the case where the number of columns is not equal to the number of rows.
- Performance pitfalls: The use of recursive function calls without memoization, which can lead to exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the solution with different input grids, including empty grids and grids with different numbers of rows and columns.
