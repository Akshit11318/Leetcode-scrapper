## Minimum Cost of a Path with Special Roads

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-of-a-path-with-special-roads/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `n`, `start`, `end`, and `roads`, where `roads` is a list of tuples `(u, v, cost)`.
- Constraints: `2 <= n <= 100`, `0 <= start, end < n`, `0 <= u, v < n`, and `0 <= cost <= 10^5`.
- Expected output: The minimum cost to travel from `start` to `end`.
- Key requirements: Consider the cost of traveling on special roads and the fact that there might be multiple paths.
- Example test cases:
  - `n = 3`, `start = 0`, `end = 1`, `roads = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,1]]`, output: `1`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible paths from `start` to `end` and calculate the cost for each path.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible paths from `start` to `end`.
  2. For each path, calculate the total cost by summing the costs of all roads in the path.
  3. Keep track of the minimum cost found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to solve the problem, but it's not efficient for large inputs.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

int minCost(int n, int start, int end, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
    // Initialize minimum cost to infinity
    int minCost = numeric_limits<int>::max();
    
    // Function to generate all possible paths
    function<void(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int node, int cost, vector<bool>& visited) {
        // If we've reached the end node, update the minimum cost
        if (node == end) {
            minCost = min(minCost, cost);
            return;
        }
        
        // Mark the current node as visited
        visited[node] = true;
        
        // Try all possible next nodes
        for (auto& road : roads) {
            int nextNode = road[0] == node ? road[1] : road[0];
            int nextCost = road[2];
            if (!visited[nextNode]) {
                dfs(nextNode, cost + nextCost, visited);
            }
        }
        
        // Unmark the current node as visited
        visited[node] = false;
    };
    
    // Start the DFS from the start node
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    dfs(start, 0, visited);
    
    return minCost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of roads, because we generate all possible paths and for each path, we iterate over all roads.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, because we need to store the visited nodes and the roads.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible paths, which leads to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we only need to store the visited nodes and the roads.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can use Dijkstra's algorithm with a twist to solve this problem. The twist is that we need to consider the cost of traveling on special roads.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a graph with the nodes and roads.
  2. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes.
  3. Keep track of the minimum cost to reach each node.
- Proof of optimality: Dijkstra's algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach already has the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int id;
    int cost;
    bool operator<(const Node& other) const {
        return cost > other.cost;
    }
};

int minCost(int n, int start, int end, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
    // Create a graph with the nodes and roads
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n);
    for (auto& road : roads) {
        graph[road[0]].push_back({road[1], road[2]});
        graph[road[1]].push_back({road[0], road[2]});
    }
    
    // Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path
    vector<int> costs(n, numeric_limits<int>::max());
    costs[start] = 0;
    priority_queue<Node> pq;
    pq.push({start, 0});
    
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        Node node = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        
        for (auto& neighbor : graph[node.id]) {
            int newCost = node.cost + neighbor.second;
            if (newCost < costs[neighbor.first]) {
                costs[neighbor.first] = newCost;
                pq.push({neighbor.first, newCost});
            }
        }
    }
    
    return costs[end];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O((n + m) \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of roads, because we use a priority queue to select the next node to visit.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dijkstra's algorithm, graph theory.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a priority queue to select the next node to visit.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a graph data structure to represent the problem.
- Similar problems to practice: Other graph problems, such as finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for negative edge weights, not handling the case where the graph is not connected.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where the graph is not connected, the case where the start node is the same as the end node.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a naive algorithm with exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the algorithm with different inputs, including edge cases.
