## Bitwise OR of All Subsequence Sums
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-or-of-all-subsequence-sums/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq \text{length of } nums \leq 20$, $1 \leq \text{each } num \leq 10^5$.
- Expected output format: The bitwise OR of all possible subsequence sums.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling sequences of varying lengths, computing subsequence sums, and performing bitwise OR operations.
- Example test cases with explanations: For `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, all possible subsequence sums are `1`, `2`, `3`, `1+2`, `1+3`, `2+3`, and `1+2+3`, resulting in the bitwise OR of `1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 = 7`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Enumerate all possible subsequences of the input array, compute their sums, and then perform a bitwise OR operation on these sums.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsequences of the input array.
  2. For each subsequence, compute its sum.
  3. Perform a bitwise OR operation on all subsequence sums.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by considering all possible subsequences and their sums.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

int subsequenceOR(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int result = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                sum += nums[i];
            }
        }
        result |= sum;
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array, because for each of the $2^n$ possible subsequences, we potentially iterate through all $n$ elements to compute the sum.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input and output, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the result and temporary variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the iteration over all possible subsequences and the computation of their sums. The space complexity is minimal because we do not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using the same approach as the brute force, as it is already quite efficient for the given constraints. The key insight is recognizing that we cannot significantly improve upon the brute force approach without changing the fundamental way we generate subsequences and compute their sums.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach remains the same as the brute force approach because it directly addresses the problem and the constraints given do not allow for significant optimization beyond what is already presented.
- Proof of optimality: The problem requires considering all possible subsequences and their sums. Given that there are $2^n$ possible subsequences for an array of length $n$, any solution must at least consider each of these subsequences once, leading to a time complexity of at least $O(2^n)$.

```cpp
// The code for the optimal approach is the same as the brute force approach
int subsequenceOR(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int result = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                sum += nums[i];
            }
        }
        result |= sum;
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array, because we iterate over all $2^n$ possible subsequences and for each, we potentially iterate through all $n$ elements to compute the sum.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input and output, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution is optimal because it must consider all possible subsequences, and the time complexity reflects the inherent complexity of the problem given the constraints.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Bitwise operations, subsequence generation, and summation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Directly addressing the problem statement by considering all possible cases.
- Optimization techniques learned: Recognizing when a brute force approach is already optimal given the constraints.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving bitwise operations, subsequence analysis, and optimization.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect use of bitwise operations, failure to consider all possible subsequences.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input array, array with a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: Attempting to optimize beyond the fundamental complexity of the problem.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with various input sizes and contents to ensure correctness.
