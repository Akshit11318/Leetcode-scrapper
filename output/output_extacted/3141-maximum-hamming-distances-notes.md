## Maximum Hamming Distance
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-hamming-distances/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a list of integers where each integer is represented in binary. The integers are stored in a vector `nums`.
- Expected output format: The function should return the maximum hamming distance between any two numbers in the list.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The hamming distance between two numbers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. The function should handle cases where the input list is empty or contains only one element.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - Example 1: Input: `nums = [4, 14, 2]`, Output: `2`. Explanation: The binary representation of `4` is `100`, `14` is `1110`, and `2` is `10`. The maximum hamming distance is between `4` and `14`, which is `2`.
    - Example 2: Input: `nums = [4, 2]`, Output: `1`. Explanation: The binary representation of `4` is `100`, and `2` is `10`. The maximum hamming distance is between `4` and `2`, which is `1`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the maximum hamming distance, we can compare each pair of numbers in the list and calculate their hamming distance.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Iterate over the list of numbers.
    2. For each pair of numbers, calculate the hamming distance by comparing their binary representations.
    3. Keep track of the maximum hamming distance found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
int maximumHammingDistance(vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxDistance = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            int distance = 0;
            int x = nums[i], y = nums[j];
            while (x || y) {
                if ((x & 1) != (y & 1)) {
                    distance++;
                }
                x >>= 1;
                y >>= 1;
            }
            maxDistance = max(maxDistance, distance);
        }
    }
    return maxDistance;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \times b)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input list and $b$ is the average number of bits in the binary representation of the numbers. This is because we are comparing each pair of numbers and calculating their hamming distance, which takes $O(b)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the maximum hamming distance.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are using nested loops to compare each pair of numbers, and the space complexity occurs because we are using a constant amount of space to store the result.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The maximum hamming distance between two numbers occurs when the numbers have no common bits set to 1.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Count the number of bits set to 1 in each position across all numbers.
    2. For each position, calculate the number of bits set to 0, which is the total number of numbers minus the count of bits set to 1.
    3. The maximum hamming distance is the minimum of the number of bits set to 1 and the number of bits set to 0 across all positions.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the maximum hamming distance without comparing each pair of numbers.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n \times b)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
int maximumHammingDistance(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxBits = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        int bits = 0;
        while (num) {
            bits++;
            num >>= 1;
        }
        maxBits = max(maxBits, bits);
    }
    
    vector<int> counts(maxBits);
    for (int num : nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < maxBits; i++) {
            if ((num >> i) & 1) {
                counts[i]++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    int maxDistance = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < maxBits; i++) {
        maxDistance = max(maxDistance, min(counts[i], n - counts[i]));
    }
    return maxDistance;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Bit manipulation, counting, and optimization techniques.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be solved by directly calculating the maximum hamming distance without comparing each pair of numbers.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimal approach uses a vector to store the count of bits set to 1 in each position, which reduces the time complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve bit manipulation and optimization techniques, such as finding the minimum hamming distance or the maximum hamming distance between two strings.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases, such as an empty input list or a list with only one element.
- Edge cases to watch for: The input list may be empty or contain only one element, and the numbers may have different lengths.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that compares each pair of numbers, which has a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input lists, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
