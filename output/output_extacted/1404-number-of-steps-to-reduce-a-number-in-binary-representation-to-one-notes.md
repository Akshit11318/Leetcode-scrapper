## Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `num`.
- Constraints: `0 <= num <= 10^6`.
- Expected output: The number of steps to reduce `num` to `1` by repeatedly applying the following operations:
  - If the current number is even, divide it by `2`.
  - If the current number is odd and `num` is not `1`, add `1` to it or subtract `1` from it.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling the case when `num` is `0`.
  - Ensuring the operations are applied correctly based on whether the current number is even or odd.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `num = 14`: The steps are `14 -> 15 -> 8 -> 7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`, resulting in `6` steps.
  - `num = 8`: The steps are `8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1`, resulting in `3` steps.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Implement the operations as described in the problem statement, keeping track of the number of steps.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start with the given `num`.
  2. Check if `num` is even or odd.
  3. If even, divide `num` by `2`.
  4. If odd and not `1`, try both adding `1` and subtracting `1` and choose the operation that leads to the fewest steps in the next iteration.
  5. Repeat steps 2-4 until `num` becomes `1`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly implements the problem statement, making it straightforward to understand and code.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSteps(int num) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (num != 1) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2;
            } else {
                // Since we need to minimize steps, we'll always add 1 if possible
                // because subtracting 1 would require an additional step to get back to an even number
                num += 1;
            }
            steps++;
        }
        return steps;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log_2(n))$ because in the worst case, we divide `num` by `2` in each step until we reach `1`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we use a constant amount of space to store the variables `num` and `steps`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is logarithmic because we effectively perform a binary search by dividing the number by `2` in each step, reducing the problem size by half. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

The provided brute force approach is already optimal because it directly implements the required operations in the most efficient way possible. It doesn't perform any unnecessary steps and uses the minimum amount of space required to solve the problem.

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Directly implementing the operations as described, with a focus on minimizing the number of steps by always choosing the operation that leads to the fewest subsequent steps.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same as the brute force approach because it's already optimized.
- Proof of optimality: The algorithm performs the minimum number of operations required to reduce `num` to `1` because it always chooses the operation that leads to the fewest subsequent steps.

```cpp
// The code remains the same as in the brute force approach
class Solution {
public:
    int numSteps(int num) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (num != 1) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2;
            } else {
                num += 1;
            }
            steps++;
        }
        return steps;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy algorithms, where choosing the locally optimal solution at each step leads to a global optimum.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Always look for operations that minimize the number of subsequent steps.
- Optimization techniques learned: Direct implementation of problem requirements, focusing on minimizing unnecessary operations and space usage.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving greedy algorithms or bit manipulation.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to handle edge cases, such as `num` being `0`.
- Edge cases to watch for: `num` being `0` or `1`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using more complex data structures or algorithms than necessary, leading to increased time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly test the function with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
