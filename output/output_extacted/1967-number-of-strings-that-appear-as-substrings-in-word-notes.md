## Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-strings-that-appear-as-substrings-in-word/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of strings `words` and a string `s`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq \text{length of } s \leq 10^4$, $1 \leq \text{number of words} \leq 10^4$, $1 \leq \text{length of each word} \leq 10^4$.
- Expected output format: The number of strings in `words` that appear as substrings in `s`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling duplicate words, case sensitivity, and ensuring each word is checked against the entire string `s`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `words = ["a","abc","d","def","g"], s = "abcdefg"` should return `3` because "a", "abc", and "def" appear in `s`.
  - `words = ["a","a","a"], s = "aa"` should return `2` because two instances of "a" can be found in `s`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each word in `words`, check every possible substring in `s` to see if it matches the word.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each word in `words`.
  2. For each word, iterate over `s` to check for matches.
  3. If a match is found, increment a counter.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward method that checks every possibility.

```cpp
int numStrings(vector<string>& words, string s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& word : words) {
        if (s.find(word) != string::npos) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of words, $m$ is the average length of a word, and $k$ is the length of `s`. This is because for each word, we potentially scan the entire string `s`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not counting the space needed for input and output, because we only use a constant amount of space to store our counter.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The nested loop structure and the `find` operation within the loop lead to these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can directly use the `find` method of C++ strings, which is optimized for substring searching. Our initial brute force is already leveraging this optimization.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: Since our brute force approach is simple and leverages an optimized method for substring searching, it's also the optimal approach for this problem given the constraints.
- Proof of optimality: The `find` method is designed for this purpose and is implemented efficiently in terms of time complexity for string searching.

```cpp
int numStrings(vector<string>& words, string s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& word : words) {
        if (s.find(word) != string::npos) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not counting the space needed for input and output, because we only use a constant amount of space to store our counter.
> - **Optimality proof:** Given the problem's constraints and the optimized nature of the `find` method, our solution is optimal for practical purposes.
