## Find the Winner of the Circular Game
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-the-circular-game/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The function takes three parameters: `n` (the number of players), `k` (the step size), and `isFriend` (a boolean indicating whether we're considering friends or not).
- Expected output format: The function returns the index of the winner in the game.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: We must handle cases where `n` is 1, `k` is 1, or `isFriend` is true or false.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if `n = 5`, `k = 2`, and `isFriend = false`, the function should return the index of the winner in the game.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can simulate the game by iterating through the players and eliminating the player at the current index plus `k` minus 1.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Create a vector to store the players.
    2. Initialize the index to 0.
    3. While there are more than one players left, calculate the next index to eliminate and remove the player at that index.
    4. Update the index to the next player.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward simulation of the game.

```cpp
vector<int> findTheWinner(int n, int k, bool isFriend) {
    vector<int> players(n);
    iota(players.begin(), players.end(), 0);
    int index = 0;
    while (players.size() > 1) {
        index = (index + k - 1) % players.size();
        players.erase(players.begin() + index);
    }
    return {players[0]};
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ because we're using the `erase` function in a loop, which has a time complexity of $O(n)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ because we're storing the players in a vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The `erase` function has to shift all the elements after the erased element, which causes the $O(n)$ time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the Josephus problem formula to calculate the winner directly.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. If `n` is 1, return 0.
    2. If `k` is 1, return `n - 1`.
    3. If `isFriend` is true, return the winner of the game with `n` players and `k` step size.
    4. If `isFriend` is false, return the winner of the game with `n` players and `n - k + 1` step size.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it calculates the winner directly without simulating the game.

```cpp
int findTheWinner(int n, int k, bool isFriend) {
    if (n == 1) return 0;
    if (k == 1) return n - 1;
    if (isFriend) return findTheWinner(n, k, false);
    return (findTheWinner(n - 1, k, false) + k - 1) % n;
}
```

However, we can further optimize the solution by using the mathematical formula for the Josephus problem.

```cpp
int findTheWinner(int n, int k, bool isFriend) {
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        ans = (ans + k) % i;
    }
    if (isFriend) return n - ans - 1;
    return ans;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ because we're using a loop to calculate the winner.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we're only using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it calculates the winner directly without simulating the game.
