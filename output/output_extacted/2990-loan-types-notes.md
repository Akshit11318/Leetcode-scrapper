## Loan Types

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/loan-types/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem requires a SQL query to find the number of loans for each type.
- Expected output format: The query should return a table with the loan type and the number of loans for each type.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The query should handle cases where there are no loans for a particular type.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if there are three loans with type 'A' and two loans with type 'B', the query should return a table with two rows, one for each type, with the count of loans for each type.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The initial thought is to use a SQL query with a `GROUP BY` clause to group the loans by type and then use the `COUNT` function to count the number of loans for each type.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Use a `SELECT` statement to select the loan type and the count of loans for each type.
  2. Use a `FROM` clause to specify the table that contains the loan data.
  3. Use a `GROUP BY` clause to group the loans by type.
  4. Use a `COUNT` function to count the number of loans for each type.

```sql
SELECT 
    type, 
    COUNT(*) 
FROM 
    Loans 
GROUP BY 
    type
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the Loans table. This is because the query needs to scan the entire table to count the number of loans for each type.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the Loans table. This is because the query needs to store the intermediate results in memory.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The complexities occur because the query needs to scan the entire table and store the intermediate results in memory.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a SQL query with a `GROUP BY` clause to group the loans by type and then use the `COUNT` function to count the number of loans for each type.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Use a `SELECT` statement to select the loan type and the count of loans for each type.
  2. Use a `FROM` clause to specify the table that contains the loan data.
  3. Use a `GROUP BY` clause to group the loans by type.
  4. Use a `COUNT` function to count the number of loans for each type.

```sql
SELECT 
    type, 
    COUNT(*) 
FROM 
    Loans 
GROUP BY 
    type
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the Loans table. This is because the query needs to scan the entire table to count the number of loans for each type.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the Loans table. This is because the query needs to store the intermediate results in memory.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because it has the minimum time and space complexity required to solve the problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem demonstrates the use of SQL queries to solve data analysis problems.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires the use of a `GROUP BY` clause to group the data and a `COUNT` function to count the number of loans for each type.
- Optimization techniques learned: The problem requires the use of efficient SQL queries to solve the problem.
- Similar problems to practice: Similar problems include data analysis problems that require the use of SQL queries to solve.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Common implementation errors include forgetting to use a `GROUP BY` clause or forgetting to use a `COUNT` function.
- Edge cases to watch for: Edge cases to watch for include cases where there are no loans for a particular type.
- Performance pitfalls: Performance pitfalls include using inefficient SQL queries that scan the entire table.
- Testing considerations: Testing considerations include testing the query with different types of data and edge cases.
