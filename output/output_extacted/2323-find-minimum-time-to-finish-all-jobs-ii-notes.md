## Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-finish-all-jobs-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of `jobs` where each job is an array of two integers representing the `difficulty` and `profit` of the job, find the minimum time to finish all jobs.
- Expected output format: The minimum time to finish all jobs.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Each job can only be done once, and we need to find the minimum time to finish all jobs.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `jobs = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]`, Output: `3`. Explanation: We can finish the first job in 1 time unit, the second job in 2 time units, and the third job in 3 time units.
  - Example 2: Input: `jobs = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4]]`, Output: `4`. Explanation: We can finish the first job in 1 time unit, the second job in 2 time units, the third job in 3 time units, and the fourth job in 4 time units.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can try all possible combinations of jobs and calculate the time to finish each combination.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of jobs.
  2. For each combination, calculate the time to finish each job.
  3. Find the minimum time to finish all jobs.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible combinations of jobs.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findMinTime(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& jobs) {
    int n = jobs.size();
    int minTime = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all possible combinations of jobs
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        int time = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                time += jobs[i][0];
            }
        }
        minTime = std::min(minTime, time);
    }
    
    return minTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of jobs. This is because we generate all possible combinations of jobs and calculate the time to finish each combination.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum time.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we try all possible combinations of jobs, and the space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum time.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can sort the jobs by their difficulties and then use a binary search to find the minimum time to finish all jobs.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the jobs by their difficulties.
  2. Use a binary search to find the minimum time to finish all jobs.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it tries all possible times to finish the jobs in a sorted order.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it tries all possible times to finish the jobs in a sorted order.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findMinTime(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& jobs) {
    int n = jobs.size();
    std::sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
        return a[0] < b[0];
    });
    
    int low = 0, high = 1e9;
    while (low < high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (jobs[i][0] <= mid) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count == n) {
            high = mid;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return low;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + n \log (10^9)) = O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of jobs. This is because we sort the jobs and then use a binary search to find the minimum time to finish all jobs.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum time.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Binary search and sorting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using binary search to find the minimum time to finish all jobs.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a binary search to reduce the time complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding the minimum time to finish all jobs.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not sorting the jobs before using a binary search.
- Edge cases to watch for: Jobs with the same difficulty.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach instead of a binary search.
- Testing considerations: Testing the code with different inputs and edge cases.
