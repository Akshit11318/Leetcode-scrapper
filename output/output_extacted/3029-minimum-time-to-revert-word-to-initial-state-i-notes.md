## Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State I
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-revert-word-to-initial-state-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` representing the word.
- Output: The minimum number of operations required to revert the word to its initial state.
- Key requirements:
  - The word can only be transformed by appending or removing a character from the end.
  - The transformation is considered valid only if the resulting word is a prefix of the target word.
- Edge cases:
  - An empty string.
  - A string with a single character.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: "abc"
    Output: 3
  - Input: "cba"
    Output: 3
  - Input: "abcd"
    Output: 4

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of appending or removing a character from the end.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Start with an empty string.
  2. For each character in the target word, try appending or removing it from the current string.
  3. If the resulting string is a prefix of the target word, update the minimum number of operations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, intuitive approach that checks all possible transformations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int minOps = 0;
        string curr = "";
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (curr + s[i] == s.substr(0, i + 1)) {
                curr += s[i];
                minOps++;
            } else {
                curr = curr.substr(0, curr.size() - 1);
                minOps++;
            }
        }
        
        return minOps;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because in the worst case, we're iterating over the string and performing a substring operation for each character.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we're storing the current string and the target word.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking all possible transformations, resulting in a quadratic time complexity due to the nested operations (iteration and substring).

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can use a **two-pointer technique** to track the current prefix and the target word.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start of the target word.
  2. Iterate over the target word, incrementing `i` for each character.
  3. If the current character at `i` matches the character at `j`, increment `j`.
  4. The minimum number of operations is the length of the target word minus the length of the longest common prefix.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a linear time complexity, making it optimal.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int j = 0;
        int minOps = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                j++;
            }
            minOps++;
        }
        
        return minOps;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we're iterating over the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're only using a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the minimum number of operations.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach has a linear time complexity, making it optimal. We're using a two-pointer technique to track the current prefix and the target word, resulting in a single pass over the string.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts: Two-pointer technique, prefix matching.
- Problem-solving patterns: Using a two-pointer technique to track the current prefix and the target word.
- Optimization techniques: Reducing the time complexity from quadratic to linear by using a single pass over the string.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases, such as an empty string.
- Edge cases to watch for: An empty string, a string with a single character.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach with a quadratic time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the solution with different input strings, including edge cases.
