## Construct Product Matrix
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-product-matrix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, construct a matrix with `k` rows and `k` columns where the element at the `i-th` row and `j-th` column is the product of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.
- Expected output format: A 2D array representing the constructed matrix.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input array `nums` will have at least `k` elements, and `k` will be greater than 0.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 2`
    - Expected Output: `[[2, 3], [4, 6]]`
  - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 3`
    - Expected Output: `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To construct the product matrix, we can simply iterate over each pair of elements from the input array `nums` and calculate their product.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize a 2D array `matrix` with `k` rows and `k` columns.
  2. Iterate over each element in the input array `nums` up to the `k-th` element.
  3. For each element `nums[i]`, iterate over each element `nums[j]` in the input array up to the `k-th` element.
  4. Calculate the product of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` and store it in the `matrix` at the `i-th` row and `j-th` column.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement by iterating over all pairs of elements and calculating their products.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> constructProductMatrix(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<vector<int>> matrix(k, vector<int>(k));
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            matrix[i][j] = nums[i] * nums[j];
        }
    }
    return matrix;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k^2)$, where $k$ is the number of rows and columns in the matrix. This is because we have two nested loops, each iterating $k$ times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k^2)$, as we need to store the constructed matrix of size $k \times k$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the nested loops used to construct the matrix, and the space complexity is due to the storage required for the matrix itself.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal for this problem because we must calculate the product of each pair of elements from the input array `nums` to construct the matrix. There are no redundant calculations or unnecessary steps that can be avoided.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach is the same as the brute force approach because it directly constructs the matrix by iterating over each pair of elements and calculating their product.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(k^2)$, which is the minimum required to construct a matrix of size $k \times k$ where each element is the product of two elements from the input array.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must perform at least $k^2$ operations to construct the matrix, and the brute force approach already achieves this.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> constructProductMatrix(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<vector<int>> matrix(k, vector<int>(k));
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            matrix[i][j] = nums[i] * nums[j];
        }
    }
    return matrix;
}
```

> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k^2)$, where $k$ is the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k^2)$, as we need to store the constructed matrix of size $k \times k$.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we must perform at least $k^2$ operations to construct the matrix, and this approach achieves that.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Matrix construction, nested loops, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct construction of the output based on the input.
- Optimization techniques learned: Recognizing when the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other matrix construction problems, such as constructing a matrix based on specific rules or patterns.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect indexing, failure to initialize the matrix, or incorrect calculation of the product.
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring that the input array `nums` has at least `k` elements and that `k` is greater than 0.
- Performance pitfalls: Assuming that there is a more efficient solution than the brute force approach when, in fact, it is already optimal.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
