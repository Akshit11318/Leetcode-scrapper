## Maximum of Absolute Value Expression

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-of-absolute-value-expression/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given four arrays `arr1`, `arr2`, `arr3`, and `arr4` of the same length `n`.
- Constraints: The length of the input arrays is `n`, where `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: The maximum value of the absolute value expression for any pair of indices `i` and `j`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: All elements in the arrays are integers, and the absolute value expression involves the sum and difference of elements from the four arrays.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `arr2 = [-1, 1, 2, 3]`, `arr3 = [3, -2, 1, 0]`, and `arr4 = [4, 1, 3, 2]`, we need to find the maximum absolute value expression.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to iterate over all pairs of indices `i` and `j` and compute the absolute value expression for each pair.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize the maximum value to negative infinity.
  2. Iterate over all pairs of indices `i` and `j`.
  3. For each pair, compute the absolute value expression using the elements from the four arrays.
  4. Update the maximum value if the current absolute value expression is larger.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is intuitive because it directly addresses the problem by considering all possible pairs of indices.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int maxAbsValExpr(std::vector<int>& arr1, std::vector<int>& arr2, std::vector<int>& arr3, std::vector<int>& arr4) {
    int n = arr1.size();
    int maxVal = INT_MIN;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int expr = abs(arr1[i] + arr2[i] + arr3[i] - arr1[j] - arr2[j] - arr3[j]) + abs(arr4[i] - arr4[j]);
            maxVal = std::max(maxVal, expr);
        }
    }
    
    return maxVal;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input arrays. This is because we have two nested loops iterating over the indices of the arrays.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum value and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is quadratic due to the nested loops, and the space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can simplify the absolute value expression and observe that it can be represented as the sum of two absolute values. This allows us to consider the maximum and minimum values of the expressions separately.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Simplify the absolute value expression to `abs(arr1[i] + arr2[i] + arr3[i] + arr4[i]) - abs(arr1[j] + arr2[j] + arr3[j] + arr4[j])`.
  2. Realize that the maximum absolute value expression will occur when the first term is maximized and the second term is minimized, or vice versa.
  3. Compute the maximum and minimum values of the expression `arr1[i] + arr2[i] + arr3[i] + arr4[i]` for all `i`.
  4. The maximum absolute value expression will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly computes the maximum possible absolute value expression by considering the extremes of the expression.

```cpp
int maxAbsValExpr(std::vector<int>& arr1, std::vector<int>& arr2, std::vector<int>& arr3, std::vector<int>& arr4) {
    int n = arr1.size();
    int maxVal = INT_MIN, minVal = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int sum = arr1[i] + arr2[i] + arr3[i] + arr4[i];
        maxVal = std::max(maxVal, sum);
        minVal = std::min(minVal, sum);
    }
    
    return maxVal - minVal;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum and minimum values.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly computes the maximum possible absolute value expression by considering the extremes of the expression, resulting in a linear time complexity.
