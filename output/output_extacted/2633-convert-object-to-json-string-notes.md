## Convert Object to JSON String

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-object-to-json-string/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem requires converting a JavaScript object into a JSON string. The input object can contain various data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and nested objects.
- Expected output format: The output should be a valid JSON string representing the input object.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The solution should handle different data types, nested objects, and arrays correctly. It should also consider edge cases like null or undefined values.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Converting a simple object: `{ "name": "John", "age": 30 }` should result in `{"name":"John","age":30}`.
  - Converting an object with nested objects: `{ "name": "John", "address": { "street": "123 Main St", "city": "Anytown" } }` should result in `{"name":"John","address":{"street":"123 Main St","city":"Anytown"}}`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves manually iterating through the object's properties and constructing the JSON string. This involves handling different data types, nested objects, and arrays.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty string to store the JSON representation.
  2. Iterate through the object's properties.
  3. For each property, append the property name and its corresponding value to the string, handling different data types and nested objects.
  4. Handle arrays by iterating through their elements and appending each element to the string.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and involves manually constructing the JSON string, which is a common way to start solving problems involving string manipulation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <vector>

std::string convertToJSON(const std::map<std::string, std::string>& obj) {
    std::string json = "{";
    for (const auto& pair : obj) {
        json += "\"" + pair.first + "\":\"" + pair.second + "\",";
    }
    // Remove the trailing comma
    if (!json.empty() && json.back() == ',') {
        json.pop_back();
    }
    json += "}";
    return json;
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    std::map<std::string, std::string> obj = {{"name", "John"}, {"age", "30"}};
    std::cout << convertToJSON(obj) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of properties in the object. This is because we iterate through each property once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of characters in the resulting JSON string. This is because we store the entire JSON string in memory.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves manual iteration and string construction, leading to linear time and space complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Utilize a library or built-in function that can efficiently convert objects to JSON strings, such as `nlohmann/json` in C++.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Include the necessary library or header file.
  2. Create a JSON object from the input object.
  3. Use the library's function to convert the JSON object to a string.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it leverages a specialized library that is highly optimized for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The library's implementation is already highly optimized, and further optimization would likely involve low-level optimizations that are not practical for most use cases.

```cpp
#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>

using json = nlohmann::json;

std::string convertToJSON(const json& obj) {
    return obj.dump();
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    json obj = {{"name", "John"}, {"age", 30}};
    std::cout << convertToJSON(obj) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of properties in the object. This is because the library's implementation is highly optimized and efficient.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of characters in the resulting JSON string. This is because the library stores the entire JSON string in memory.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach leverages a highly optimized library, making it the most efficient solution.
