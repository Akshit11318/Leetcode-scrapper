## Subarray with Elements Greater Than Varying Threshold

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-with-elements-greater-than-varying-threshold/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A 2D array `nums` where each subarray represents a list of integers and a list of thresholds `threshold`.
- Output: Find the maximum length of a subarray from the given array such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than the corresponding threshold.
- Key Requirements:
  - The subarray must be non-empty.
  - The sum of the elements in the subarray must be greater than the corresponding threshold.
- Edge Cases:
  - The input array may be empty.
  - The input threshold may be empty.
  - The input array and threshold may have different lengths.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate over all possible subarrays of the given array and calculate their sums.
- Then, compare these sums with the corresponding threshold and keep track of the maximum length of the subarray that has a sum greater than the threshold.
- This approach comes to mind first because it is straightforward and easy to implement.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int longestSubarray(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& nums, std::vector<int>& threshold) {
    int maxLength = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                sum += nums[k][0];
            }
            if (sum > threshold[i]) {
                maxLength = std::max(maxLength, j - i + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of subarrays. This is because we have three nested loops: one to iterate over the starting index of the subarray, one to iterate over the ending index of the subarray, and one to calculate the sum of the subarray.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum length and the sum of the subarray.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is cubic because we have three nested loops, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the maximum length and the sum.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is to use a prefix sum array to calculate the sum of the subarray in constant time.
- We can then use a binary search to find the maximum length of the subarray that has a sum greater than the threshold.
- This approach is optimal because it reduces the time complexity from cubic to quadratic.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int longestSubarray(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& nums, std::vector<int>& threshold) {
    int maxLength = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            sum += nums[j][0];
            if (sum > threshold[i]) {
                maxLength = std::max(maxLength, j - i + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of subarrays. This is because we have two nested loops: one to iterate over the starting index of the subarray and one to iterate over the ending index of the subarray.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum length and the sum of the subarray.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we have reduced the time complexity from cubic to quadratic, and we cannot do better than this because we must at least iterate over the starting and ending indices of the subarray.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The key algorithmic concept demonstrated is the use of prefix sum arrays to calculate the sum of a subarray in constant time.
- The problem-solving pattern identified is the use of binary search to find the maximum length of a subarray that meets a certain condition.
- The optimization technique learned is the reduction of time complexity from cubic to quadratic by using a prefix sum array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- A common implementation error is to forget to initialize the maximum length variable to 0.
- An edge case to watch for is when the input array is empty or the input threshold is empty.
- A performance pitfall is to use a naive approach that has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$, which can be slow for large inputs.
