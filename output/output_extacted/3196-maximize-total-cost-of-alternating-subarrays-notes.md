## Maximize Total Cost of Alternating Subarrays

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-total-cost-of-alternating-subarrays/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums1.length <= 1000`, `1 <= nums2.length <= 1000`, `1 <= k <= 1000`.
- Expected Output: The maximum possible total cost of alternating subarrays.
- Key Requirements:
  - Choose `k` non-overlapping subarrays from `nums1` and `nums2` alternately.
  - Calculate the cost of each subarray as the sum of its elements multiplied by its length.
  - The goal is to maximize the total cost.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [1,3,3], k = 2`
- `nums1 = [1,3,3], nums2 = [1,2,3], k = 2`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking all possible combinations of subarrays from `nums1` and `nums2`.
- This approach is intuitive but inefficient due to its high computational complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCost(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k) {
        int m = nums1.size(), n = nums2.size();
        int maxCost = 0;
        
        // Generate all possible subarrays for nums1 and nums2
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= m; j++) {
                for (int p = 0; p < n; p++) {
                    for (int q = p + 1; q <= n; q++) {
                        // Calculate cost for each pair of subarrays and update maxCost
                        int cost1 = calculateCost(nums1, i, j);
                        int cost2 = calculateCost(nums2, p, q);
                        maxCost = max(maxCost, cost1 + cost2);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxCost;
    }
    
    int calculateCost(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        int cost = 0;
        for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
            cost += nums[i];
        }
        return cost * (end - start);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m^2 \cdot n^2)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. This is due to the four nested loops iterating over all possible subarray combinations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for input arrays, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum cost and temporary costs.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks all possible combinations of subarrays, leading to exponential time complexity. The space complexity remains constant because we do not use any data structures that scale with input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal solution involves recognizing that the maximum cost can be achieved by choosing the subarrays with the highest sum-to-length ratio from both `nums1` and `nums2` alternately.
- We can use a dynamic programming approach to track the maximum cost achievable at each step of choosing subarrays.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCost(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k) {
        int m = nums1.size(), n = nums2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(2, 0)); // dp[i][0] for nums1, dp[i][1] for nums2
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
                int other = 1 - j; // Alternate between nums1 and nums2
                int maxSubarrayCost = 0;
                for (int start = 0; start < (j == 0 ? m : n); start++) {
                    int sum = 0;
                    for (int end = start + 1; end <= (j == 0 ? m : n); end++) {
                        sum += (j == 0 ? nums1[end - 1] : nums2[end - 1]);
                        int cost = sum * (end - start);
                        maxSubarrayCost = max(maxSubarrayCost, cost + dp[i - 1][other]);
                    }
                }
                dp[i][j] = maxSubarrayCost;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[k][0];
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot m^2 \cdot n^2)$, where $k$ is the number of subarrays to choose, and $m$ and $n$ are the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. This is due to the nested loops iterating over all possible subarray combinations for each step of the dynamic programming.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, as we use a 2D array of size $k \times 2$ to store the dynamic programming table.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it considers all possible combinations of subarrays from `nums1` and `nums2` in an alternating manner, ensuring that the maximum total cost is achieved.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of recognizing patterns and applying dynamic programming to solve complex problems.
- Understanding how to calculate the cost of subarrays and how it applies to the overall problem.
- The trade-off between time and space complexity in different approaches.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the alternating nature of the subarray selection.
- Failing to optimize the solution by not using dynamic programming.
- Not handling edge cases, such as when `k` is greater than the total number of elements in both arrays.
