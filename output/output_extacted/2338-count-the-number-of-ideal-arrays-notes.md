## Count the Number of Ideal Arrays
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-ideal-arrays/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an integer `n` and an array `prefixes` of length `k`, find the number of ideal arrays of length `n`. An ideal array is an array where the `i-th` element is the sum of all elements in the prefix `i` of the `prefixes` array.
- Input format and constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= k <= min(32, n)`, `1 <= prefixes[i] <= 2^30 - 1`.
- Expected output format: The number of ideal arrays of length `n`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where `n` is small, and cases where `k` is close to `n`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For `n = 5` and `prefixes = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output should be the number of ideal arrays of length `5`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible arrays of length `n` and check if each array is ideal.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible arrays of length `n`.
  2. For each array, calculate the prefix sums using the `prefixes` array.
  3. Check if the `i-th` element of the array is equal to the sum of all elements in the prefix `i` of the `prefixes` array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive solution.

```cpp
int countIdealArrays(int n, vector<int>& prefixes) {
    int res = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        vector<int> arr(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = (mask >> i) & 1;
        }
        bool isIdeal = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j <= i && j < prefixes.size(); j++) {
                sum += prefixes[j];
            }
            if (arr[i] != sum) {
                isIdeal = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isIdeal) {
            res++;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the array and $k$ is the length of the `prefixes` array. This is because we generate all possible arrays of length `n` and for each array, we calculate the prefix sums using the `prefixes` array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. This is because we need to store the array of length `n`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity because it generates all possible arrays of length `n` and checks if each array is ideal. The space complexity is relatively low because we only need to store the array of length `n`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `n + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ideal arrays of length `i`.
  2. For each `i` from `1` to `n`, calculate `dp[i]` using the `prefixes` array.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it avoids the overhead of generating all possible arrays of length `n` and checks if each array is ideal.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot k)$, which is the minimum possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
int countIdealArrays(int n, vector<int>& prefixes) {
    vector<int> dp(n + 1);
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < prefixes.size() && j <= i; j++) {
            dp[i] += dp[i - j - 1];
        }
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the array and $k$ is the length of the `prefixes` array. This is because we use a dynamic programming table of size `n + 1` and for each `i` from `1` to `n`, we calculate `dp[i]` using the `prefixes` array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n` is the length of the array. This is because we need to store the dynamic programming table of size `n + 1`.
> - **Optimality proof:** The dynamic programming approach is optimal because it avoids the overhead of generating all possible arrays of length `n` and checks if each array is ideal.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, prefix sums.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using dynamic programming to avoid generating all possible solutions.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity of the solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems that involve dynamic programming and prefix sums.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the dynamic programming table correctly, not calculating the prefix sums correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Cases where `n` is small, cases where `k` is close to `n`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach instead of dynamic programming.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different values of `n` and `k`, testing the solution with edge cases.
