## Minimum Amount of Time to Collect Garbage

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-amount-of-time-to-collect-garbage/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given three arrays: `garbage`, `travel`, and `time`. `garbage[i]` is the amount of garbage at location `i`, `travel[i]` is the time it takes to travel from location `i` to `i+1`, and `time[i]` is the time it takes to collect one unit of garbage at location `i`.
- Expected output format: The minimum amount of time required to collect all the garbage.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The garbage collection process starts at location `0`, and the time it takes to collect garbage at each location is given by `time[i] * garbage[i]`. The time it takes to travel between locations is given by `travel[i]`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `garbage = [2,3,3], travel = [2,1,1], time = [2,3,1]`: The minimum amount of time required to collect all the garbage is `10`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the time it takes to collect garbage at each location and add the travel time to the next location.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `total_time` to `0`.
  2. For each location `i`, calculate the time it takes to collect garbage at that location: `time[i] * garbage[i]`.
  3. Add the time it takes to collect garbage at the current location to `total_time`.
  4. If it's not the last location, add the travel time to the next location to `total_time`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to calculate the time it takes to collect all the garbage.

```cpp
int garbageCollection(vector<int>& garbage, vector<int>& travel, vector<int>& time) {
    int total_time = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < garbage.size(); i++) {
        total_time += time[i] * garbage[i];
        if (i < garbage.size() - 1) {
            total_time += travel[i];
        }
    }
    return total_time;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of locations. This is because we're iterating over the locations once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're only using a constant amount of space to store the `total_time` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we're doing a constant amount of work for each location, and the space complexity is constant because we're not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. However, in this case, the brute force approach is already optimal because we need to visit each location once to collect the garbage.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach is the same as the brute force approach.
- Proof of optimality: The optimal approach is optimal because we need to visit each location once to collect the garbage, and we're doing a constant amount of work for each location.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we need to visit each location once to collect the garbage, and we're already doing the minimum amount of work required to collect the garbage.

```cpp
int garbageCollection(vector<int>& garbage, vector<int>& travel, vector<int>& time) {
    int total_time = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < garbage.size(); i++) {
        total_time += time[i] * garbage[i];
        if (i < garbage.size() - 1) {
            total_time += travel[i];
        }
    }
    return total_time;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming is not necessary in this case, but the problem can be solved using a simple iterative approach.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be solved by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems and solving each sub-problem only once.
- Optimization techniques learned: The problem can be optimized by using a dynamic programming approach, but in this case, the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve dynamic programming and optimization.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `total_time` variable to `0`.
- Edge cases to watch for: Not checking if the input arrays are empty.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a constant amount of space to store the `total_time` variable.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input arrays to ensure it works correctly.
