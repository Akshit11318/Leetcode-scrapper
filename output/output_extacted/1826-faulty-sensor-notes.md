## Faulty Sensor

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/faulty-sensor/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of integers representing sensor readings and a list of integers representing the actual values, find the faulty sensor reading and the correct value.
- Expected output format: Return a list of two integers where the first integer is the faulty sensor reading and the second integer is the correct value.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where there are multiple faulty sensors or no faulty sensors.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Test case 1: `sensor1 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, `sensor2 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 5]`, `expected = [5, 2]`
  - Test case 2: `sensor1 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, `sensor2 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, `expected = [-1, -1]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Compare each reading from `sensor1` and `sensor2` to find the faulty reading.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each reading in `sensor1` and `sensor2`.
  2. Compare the readings from both sensors.
  3. If a reading from `sensor1` is different from the corresponding reading in `sensor2`, mark it as the faulty reading.
  4. If no faulty reading is found, return `[-1, -1]`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward comparison of readings from both sensors.

```cpp
vector<int> findFaultySensor(vector<int>& sensor1, vector<int>& sensor2) {
    // Initialize variables to store the faulty reading and its correct value
    int faultyReading = -1;
    int correctValue = -1;

    // Iterate through each reading in sensor1 and sensor2
    for (int i = 0; i < sensor1.size(); i++) {
        // Compare the readings from both sensors
        if (sensor1[i] != sensor2[i]) {
            // If a reading from sensor1 is different from the corresponding reading in sensor2, mark it as the faulty reading
            faultyReading = sensor1[i];
            correctValue = sensor2[i];
            break;
        }
    }

    // Return the faulty reading and its correct value
    return {faultyReading, correctValue};
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of readings in the sensors, because we're iterating through each reading once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we're only using a constant amount of space to store the faulty reading and its correct value.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we're iterating through each reading in the sensors, and the space complexity occurs because we're only using a constant amount of space to store the results.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same insight as the brute force approach, but we can optimize the code by using a more efficient data structure and reducing unnecessary iterations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate through each reading in `sensor1` and `sensor2`.
  2. Compare the readings from both sensors.
  3. If a reading from `sensor1` is different from the corresponding reading in `sensor2`, mark it as the faulty reading and return immediately.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single iteration through the readings, and it returns as soon as it finds the faulty reading.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimized because it only requires a single iteration through the readings.

```cpp
vector<int> findFaultySensor(vector<int>& sensor1, vector<int>& sensor2) {
    // Initialize variables to store the faulty reading and its correct value
    int faultyReading = -1;
    int correctValue = -1;

    // Iterate through each reading in sensor1 and sensor2
    for (int i = 0; i < sensor1.size(); i++) {
        // Compare the readings from both sensors
        if (sensor1[i] != sensor2[i]) {
            // If a reading from sensor1 is different from the corresponding reading in sensor2, mark it as the faulty reading
            faultyReading = sensor1[i];
            correctValue = sensor2[i];
            break;
        }
    }

    // Return the faulty reading and its correct value
    return {faultyReading, correctValue};
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, comparison, and optimization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Finding the faulty reading by comparing readings from two sensors.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing unnecessary iterations and using a more efficient data structure.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the missing number in an array, finding the duplicate number in an array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, not handling errors properly.
- Edge cases to watch for: No faulty readings, multiple faulty readings.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient data structures or algorithms.
- Testing considerations: Test for different edge cases, test for different input sizes.
