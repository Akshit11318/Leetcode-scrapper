## Bikes Last Time Used

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/bikes-last-time-used/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A list of integers representing the last time each bike was used.
- Constraints: The length of the input list is in the range $[1, 10^5]$ and each element is in the range $[1, 10^9]$.
- Expected output: The number of bikes that have not been used in the last `k` units of time.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The input list may contain duplicate elements.
  - The value of `k` may be larger than the maximum element in the input list.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `[3, 4, 6, 1]`, `k = 3`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The bikes with last usage times `4` and `6` have not been used in the last `3` units of time.
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 5`
  - Output: `4`
  - Explanation: All bikes have not been used in the last `5` units of time.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to simply iterate over the list of last usage times and count the number of bikes that have not been used in the last `k` units of time.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize a counter variable to store the number of bikes that have not been used in the last `k` units of time.
  2. Iterate over the list of last usage times.
  3. For each last usage time, check if it is less than or equal to the current time minus `k`.
  4. If the condition is true, increment the counter variable.
  5. After iterating over the entire list, return the counter variable.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int number_of_bikes(int k, vector<int>& last_used) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < last_used.size(); i++) {
            if (last_used[i] <= k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input list. This is because we are iterating over the list once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the counter variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are iterating over the list once, and the space complexity is constant because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the counter variable.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is that we can simply iterate over the list of last usage times and count the number of bikes that have not been used in the last `k` units of time.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a counter variable to store the number of bikes that have not been used in the last `k` units of time.
  2. Iterate over the list of last usage times.
  3. For each last usage time, check if it is less than or equal to the current time minus `k`.
  4. If the condition is true, increment the counter variable.
  5. After iterating over the entire list, return the counter variable.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int number_of_bikes(int k, vector<int>& last_used) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < last_used.size(); i++) {
            if (last_used[i] <= k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the counter variable.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because we must iterate over the list at least once to count the number of bikes that have not been used in the last `k` units of time. The time complexity of $O(n)$ is the best we can achieve for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: iteration, conditional statements, and counter variables.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: iterating over a list and counting elements that meet a certain condition.
- Optimization techniques learned: none, as the problem does not require optimization beyond the optimal solution.
- Similar problems to practice: counting elements in a list that meet a certain condition.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: off-by-one errors, incorrect conditional statements, and incorrect use of counter variables.
- Edge cases to watch for: empty input lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with elements that are not integers.
- Performance pitfalls: using unnecessary data structures or algorithms that have higher time complexities than the optimal solution.
- Testing considerations: testing the function with different input lists, including edge cases, to ensure it produces the correct output.
