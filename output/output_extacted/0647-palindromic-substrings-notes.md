## Palindromic Substrings

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a string `s`. The length of `s` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`. 
- Expected output format: The function should return the number of different substrings which are palindromes.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: A substring can be a single character, and it is considered a palindrome. The input string can contain any ASCII character.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `"abc"`, Output: `3`, Explanation: `"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"` are palindromic substrings.
  - Example 2: Input: `"aaa"`, Output: `6`, Explanation: `"a"`, `"a"`, `"a"`, `"aa"`, `"aa"`, and `"aaa"` are palindromic substrings.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible substrings of the input string `s`, and check each one to see if it's a palindrome.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible substrings of `s`.
  2. For each substring, check if it's equal to its reverse. If it is, increment the count of palindromic substrings.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to solve the problem by checking every possible substring.

```cpp
int countSubstrings(string s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= s.length(); j++) {
            string substr = s.substr(i, j - i);
            string reversed = substr;
            reverse(reversed.begin(), reversed.end());
            if (substr == reversed) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we're generating all substrings ($O(n^2)$) and checking if each one is a palindrome by reversing it ($O(n)$).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store the reversed substring.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves a lot of repeated work, especially when reversing substrings, leading to high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all substrings and checking if they're palindromes, we can expand around the center of potential palindromes.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Consider each character in the string as the center of a potential palindrome.
  2. For each character, expand outwards to check for palindromes of odd length.
  3. For each character and the one next to it, expand outwards to check for palindromes of even length.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures we check all possible palindromic substrings without unnecessary repetition, leading to a more efficient solution.

```cpp
int countSubstrings(string s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        // Odd length palindrome
        count += expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);
        // Even length palindrome
        count += expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);
    }
    return count;
}

int expandAroundCenter(string s, int left, int right) {
    int count = 0;
    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s[left] == s[right]) {
        count++;
        left--;
        right++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we're potentially expanding around each character, and the expansion itself takes $O(n)$ time in the worst case.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're only using a constant amount of space to store the indices and the count.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it ensures that we check all possible substrings that could be palindromes without unnecessary repetition, achieving the best possible time complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Expanding around the center of potential palindromes, avoiding unnecessary computation by considering the properties of palindromes.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Looking for ways to reduce computation by exploiting the structure of the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding repeated work, using the properties of the problem to minimize computation.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation problems, especially those involving palindromes or substrings.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not considering edge cases, such as single-character palindromes or palindromes at the beginning or end of the string.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty strings, strings with only one character, strings with all characters being the same.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms that lead to high time complexity, such as generating all substrings and checking each one.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with various inputs, including edge cases and large strings, to ensure correctness and performance.
