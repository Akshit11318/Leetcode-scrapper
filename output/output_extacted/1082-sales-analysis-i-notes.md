## Sales Analysis I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sales-analysis-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: We are given two tables, `Sales` and `Company`. The `Sales` table contains information about the sales of products, including the `id`, `product_id`, and `sale_date`. The `Company` table contains information about the companies, including the `id` and `name`. 
- Expected output format: We need to find the `id` and `name` of the company that has the most sales.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: We should consider the case where there are multiple companies with the same maximum sales. In this case, we should return the company with the smallest `id`.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - If we have two companies, `A` and `B`, with sales of `10` and `20` respectively, the output should be `B`.
    - If we have two companies, `A` and `B`, with sales of `10` and `10` respectively, the output should be `A`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can use a brute force approach to solve this problem by iterating over all the rows in the `Sales` table and counting the number of sales for each company.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Initialize a dictionary to store the count of sales for each company.
    2. Iterate over all the rows in the `Sales` table.
    3. For each row, find the company that made the sale and increment the count in the dictionary.
    4. After iterating over all the rows, find the company with the maximum count.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand. It involves iterating over all the rows in the `Sales` table and counting the number of sales for each company.

```cpp
SELECT c.id, c.name 
FROM Company c 
JOIN Sales s ON c.id = s.company_id 
GROUP BY c.id, c.name 
ORDER BY COUNT(s.id) DESC, c.id ASC 
LIMIT 1;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Sales` table. This is because we are using a `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clause, which have a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Sales` table. This is because we are storing the count of sales for each company in a dictionary.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are using a `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clause, which involve sorting and grouping the data. The space complexity occurs because we are storing the count of sales for each company in a dictionary.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a SQL query to solve this problem in a more efficient way. We can use a `GROUP BY` clause to group the sales by company and a `COUNT` function to count the number of sales for each company. We can then use an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the companies by the count of sales in descending order and the `id` in ascending order.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Use a `GROUP BY` clause to group the sales by company.
    2. Use a `COUNT` function to count the number of sales for each company.
    3. Use an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the companies by the count of sales in descending order and the `id` in ascending order.
    4. Use a `LIMIT` clause to return only the top company.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a single SQL query to solve the problem, which is more efficient than iterating over all the rows in the `Sales` table.

```cpp
SELECT c.id, c.name 
FROM Company c 
JOIN Sales s ON c.id = s.company_id 
GROUP BY c.id, c.name 
ORDER BY COUNT(s.id) DESC, c.id ASC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: We learned how to use a `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clause to group and sort data in a SQL query.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: We learned how to use a single SQL query to solve a problem, which is more efficient than iterating over all the rows in a table.
- Optimization techniques learned: We learned how to use a `LIMIT` clause to return only the top result.
- Similar problems to practice: We can practice similar problems that involve grouping and sorting data in a SQL query.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: We should avoid using a brute force approach to solve this problem, as it is less efficient than using a single SQL query.
- Edge cases to watch for: We should consider the case where there are multiple companies with the same maximum sales. In this case, we should return the company with the smallest `id`.
- Performance pitfalls: We should avoid using a `SELECT \*` statement, as it can return more data than necessary and reduce performance.
- Testing considerations: We should test the query with different inputs and edge cases to ensure that it is working correctly.
