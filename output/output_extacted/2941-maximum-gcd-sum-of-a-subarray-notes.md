## Maximum GCD Sum of a Subarray

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-gcd-sum-of-a-subarray/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`, `1 <= k <= nums.length`.
- Expected output format: The maximum sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all subarrays of length `k`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling edge cases where `k` equals the length of `nums`, ensuring the GCD calculation is efficient, and considering all possible subarrays of length `k`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = [1, 4, 2, 3]` and `k = 3`, the maximum GCD sum is `gcd(1, 4, 2) + gcd(4, 2, 3) = 1 + 1 = 2`.
  - For `nums = [1, 1, 1]` and `k = 2`, the maximum GCD sum is `gcd(1, 1) + gcd(1, 1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the GCD for all possible subarrays of length `k` and sum them up.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all subarrays of length `k`.
  2. For each subarray, calculate the GCD of its elements.
  3. Sum up the GCDs of all subarrays.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem by considering all possible subarrays and calculating their GCDs.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

int gcdSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int start, int k) {
    int result = nums[start];
    for (int i = start + 1; i < start + k; ++i) {
        result = gcd(result, nums[i]);
    }
    return result;
}

int maxGcdSum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int maxSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= nums.size() - k; ++i) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < nums.size() - k + 1; j += k) {
            sum += gcdSubarray(nums, j, k);
        }
        maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot k \cdot log(m))$ where $n$ is the size of `nums`, $k$ is the length of the subarray, and $m$ is the maximum value in `nums`. The reason is that for each starting position, we calculate the GCD of a subarray of length `k`, and we do this for all possible starting positions. The GCD calculation itself takes $O(log(m))$ time due to the recursive nature of the Euclidean algorithm.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum sum and temporary results.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are considering all possible subarrays and calculating their GCDs, which involves recursive function calls. The space complexity is low because we do not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of calculating the GCD for each subarray from scratch, we can use a prefix GCD array to store the GCD of all subarrays ending at each position. However, this problem does not directly benefit from such an approach due to its nature of requiring the sum of GCDs of non-overlapping subarrays.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Since the brute force approach already considers all subarrays and their GCDs, we look for optimizations within the GCD calculation itself.
  2. Utilize an iterative method for GCD calculation instead of recursion for potential performance improvements.
- Proof of optimality: Given the problem's constraints and the need to consider all possible subarrays, the optimal approach involves minimizing the time complexity of GCD calculations and ensuring efficient iteration over the array.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

int maxGcdSum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int maxSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= nums.size() - k; ++i) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < nums.size() - k + 1; j += k) {
            int subarrayGcd = nums[j];
            for (int offset = 1; offset < k; ++offset) {
                subarrayGcd = gcd(subarrayGcd, nums[j + offset]);
            }
            sum += subarrayGcd;
        }
        maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot k \cdot log(m))$ where $n$ is the size of `nums`, $k$ is the length of the subarray, and $m$ is the maximum value in `nums`. This remains the same as the brute force approach because the optimization primarily affects the constant factors rather than the overall time complexity.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum sum and temporary results.
> - **Optimality proof:** The problem requires considering all subarrays of length `k` and calculating their GCDs. The given approach does this efficiently by minimizing the overhead of GCD calculations. Further optimization would require a different problem-solving strategy that avoids the need for explicit GCD calculations for each subarray.
