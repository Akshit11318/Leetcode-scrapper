## Points That Intersect With Cars
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/points-that-intersect-with-cars/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given a list of `points` where each point is represented as `[x, y]`, and a list of `cars` where each car is represented as `[x, y, d]`, where `d` is the direction the car is moving (either 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W').
- Constraints: `1 <= points.length <= 100`, `1 <= cars.length <= 100`, `-10^4 <= x, y <= 10^4`.
- Expected output format: Return a list of points that intersect with any car.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where points are on the same line as the car's path but do not intersect, and where points are directly on the car's path.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each point, check if it intersects with the path of any car.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each point.
  2. For each point, iterate over each car.
  3. Calculate the equation of the line representing the car's path based on its direction.
  4. Check if the point lies on the line or within the bounds of the car's movement.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by checking every possible intersection.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to check if a point intersects with a car's path
bool intersects(vector<int>& point, vector<int>& car, char direction) {
    int px = point[0], py = point[1];
    int cx = car[0], cy = car[1];
    
    // Calculate the equation of the line for the car's path
    if (direction == 'N' || direction == 'S') {
        // Vertical line, check if point's x-coordinate matches
        if (px == cx) {
            // Check if point's y-coordinate is within the car's y-coordinate range
            if (direction == 'N' && py >= cy) return true;
            if (direction == 'S' && py <= cy) return true;
        }
    } else {
        // Horizontal line, check if point's y-coordinate matches
        if (py == cy) {
            // Check if point's x-coordinate is within the car's x-coordinate range
            if (direction == 'E' && px >= cx) return true;
            if (direction == 'W' && px <= cx) return true;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

vector<vector<int>> intersectingPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, vector<vector<int>>& cars) {
    vector<vector<int>> intersecting;
    for (auto& point : points) {
        for (auto& car : cars) {
            char direction = car[2];
            if (intersects(point, {car[0], car[1]}, direction)) {
                intersecting.push_back(point);
                break; // No need to check other cars once intersection is found
            }
        }
    }
    return intersecting;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of points and $m$ is the number of cars, because for each point, we potentially check every car.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the intersecting points.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks every point against every car, leading to a time complexity that is the product of the number of points and cars. The space complexity is linear with respect to the number of points because, in the worst case, all points could intersect with a car.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same as the brute force, but with a more efficient data structure or algorithmic approach, there's no significant improvement due to the nature of the problem requiring checking each point against each car's path. However, the current implementation is already relatively optimal given the constraints and the need to check each point against each car.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The provided brute force approach is already simplified and directly addresses the problem without unnecessary complexity. Given the small input sizes, further optimization might not yield significant improvements.
- Proof of optimality: The problem inherently requires checking each point against each car's path, making the time complexity at least $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of points and $m$ is the number of cars.

```cpp
// The code provided in the brute force section is already optimized for this problem's constraints.
```

> - **Optimality proof:** The problem's nature dictates that each point must be checked against each car, making the $O(n \cdot m)$ time complexity optimal for this scenario.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional checks, and basic geometry.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking each element of one set against each element of another set.
- Optimization techniques learned: Simplifying the problem statement into basic checks.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving geometric intersections or set comparisons.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling edge cases or misinterpreting the problem statement.
- Edge cases to watch for: Points exactly on the car's path or at the boundary of the car's movement range.
- Performance pitfalls: Unnecessary complexity or failing to break out of loops when an intersection is found.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various input sizes and edge cases to validate the solution's correctness and performance.
