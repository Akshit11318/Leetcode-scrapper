## Number of Increasing Paths in a Grid
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-increasing-paths-in-a-grid/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D grid of integers.
- Constraints: The grid can contain any number of rows and columns, and the values in the grid can range from 0 to 100.
- Expected output format: The total number of increasing paths in the grid.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - An increasing path is a path where each cell's value is greater than the previous cell's value.
  - We can only move either down or right at any point in time.
  - We can start from any cell in the grid.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For a grid like [[1,2],[3,4]], the number of increasing paths is 3: [1,2], [1,3,4], [2,3,4].

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to try all possible paths from each cell.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start from each cell in the grid.
  2. For each cell, try moving down and right, and recursively count the number of increasing paths.
  3. If the current cell's value is not greater than the previous cell's value, do not count this path.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible solutions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPaths(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                ans += dfs(grid, i, j, -1);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y, int prev) {
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        if (x < 0 || x >= rows || y < 0 || y >= cols || grid[x][y] <= prev) {
            return 0;
        }
        int ans = 1;
        int curr = grid[x][y];
        grid[x][y] = -1;
        ans += dfs(grid, x + 1, y, curr);
        ans += dfs(grid, x, y + 1, curr);
        grid[x][y] = curr;
        return ans;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{rows \times cols})$ because in the worst case, we are trying all possible paths.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(rows \times cols)$ for the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible solutions, resulting in exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to store the number of increasing paths from each cell.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a 2D array `dp` to store the number of increasing paths from each cell.
  2. Initialize `dp` with 0.
  3. For each cell, try moving down and right, and update `dp` with the number of increasing paths.
  4. Finally, sum up all values in `dp` to get the total number of increasing paths.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(rows \times cols)$, which is optimal because we need to visit each cell at least once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPaths(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(rows, vector<int>(cols, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dfs(grid, dp, i, j);
            }
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                ans += dp[i][j];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& dp, int x, int y) {
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        if (dp[x][y] != 0) return dp[x][y];
        int ans = 1;
        int curr = grid[x][y];
        if (x + 1 < rows && grid[x + 1][y] > curr) {
            ans += dfs(grid, dp, x + 1, y);
        }
        if (y + 1 < cols && grid[x][y + 1] > curr) {
            ans += dfs(grid, dp, x, y + 1);
        }
        dp[x][y] = ans;
        return ans;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(rows \times cols)$ because we visit each cell at most twice.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(rows \times cols)$ for the `dp` array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we only visit each cell at most twice, resulting in linear time complexity.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming and depth-first search.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using dynamic programming to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computation.
- Optimization techniques learned: Memoization and dynamic programming.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding paths in a grid, such as the "Unique Paths" problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases correctly, such as out-of-bounds errors.
- Edge cases to watch for: Grids with zero rows or columns, grids with all zeros, and grids with all ones.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that tries all possible paths, resulting in exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different grid sizes, values, and edge cases to ensure correctness and performance.
