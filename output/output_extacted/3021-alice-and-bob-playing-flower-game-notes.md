## Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/alice-and-bob-playing-flower-game/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input consists of an integer array `flowers` and an integer `k`.
- Expected output format: Return the maximum number of flowers that Alice and Bob can have after playing the game.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    * Alice and Bob take turns picking flowers from the array.
    * Each player can only pick one flower from each end of the array.
    * The game ends when there are no more flowers to pick.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    * `flowers = [2, 5, 1, 4, 3]`, `k = 3`, output: `6`
    * `flowers = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `k = 2`, output: `3`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can simulate the game by iterating over all possible combinations of flower picks.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize the total number of flowers picked to 0.
    2. Iterate over all possible combinations of flower picks using recursion or backtracking.
    3. For each combination, calculate the total number of flowers picked by Alice and Bob.
    4. Update the maximum number of flowers picked.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it has an exponential time complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFlowers(vector<int>& flowers, int k) {
        int n = flowers.size();
        int maxFlowers = 0;
        function<void(int, int, int, int)> dfs = 
            [&](int i, int j, int alice, int bob) {
                if (i > j) {
                    maxFlowers = max(maxFlowers, alice + bob);
                    return;
                }
                // Alice picks the flower from the left end
                dfs(i + 1, j, alice + flowers[i], bob);
                // Alice picks the flower from the right end
                dfs(i, j - 1, alice + flowers[j], bob);
                // Bob picks the flower from the left end
                dfs(i + 1, j, alice, bob + flowers[i]);
                // Bob picks the flower from the right end
                dfs(i, j - 1, alice, bob + flowers[j]);
            };
        dfs(0, n - 1, 0, 0);
        return maxFlowers;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(4^n)$, where $n$ is the number of flowers. This is because we have four possible choices for each flower (Alice picks from the left, Alice picks from the right, Bob picks from the left, Bob picks from the right).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of flowers. This is because of the recursion stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has an exponential time complexity because we are exploring all possible combinations of flower picks. The space complexity is linear because of the recursion stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to memoize the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum number of flowers picked by Alice and Bob for each subproblem.
    2. Iterate over the flowers from left to right and from right to left.
    3. For each subproblem, calculate the maximum number of flowers picked by Alice and Bob by considering all possible combinations of flower picks.
    4. Update the `dp` array with the maximum number of flowers picked for each subproblem.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach ensures that we only calculate each subproblem once and store the result in the `dp` array. This avoids redundant calculations and reduces the time complexity to $O(n^2)$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFlowers(vector<int>& flowers, int k) {
        int n = flowers.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = flowers[i];
        }
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + (i == j ? flowers[i] : 0);
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, memoization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Memoization, dynamic programming.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the Fibonacci sequence or the knapsack problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` array correctly, not updating the `dp` array correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where the input array is empty, handling the case where the input array has only one element.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using memoization or dynamic programming, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input arrays, testing the function with edge cases.
