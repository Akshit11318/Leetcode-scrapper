## Check If a String Can Break Another String
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-string-can-break-another-string/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, determine if `s1` can break `s2`. 
- Expected output format: Return `true` if `s1` can break `s2`, `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - Both strings consist of lowercase English letters.
  - `s1` can break `s2` if `s1` can be rearranged to form a string that is lexicographically smaller than `s2` or equal to it.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If `s1 = "abc"` and `s2 = "xyz"`, `s1` can break `s2` because `abc` is lexicographically smaller than `xyz`.
  - If `s1 = "xyz"` and `s2 = "abc"`, `s1` cannot break `s2` because `xyz` is lexicographically larger than `abc`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Sort both strings and compare them character by character to determine if `s1` can break `s2`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Sort both strings `s1` and `s2`.
  2. Compare the sorted strings character by character.
  3. If at any point the character in `s1` is greater than the corresponding character in `s2`, return `false`.
  4. If the loop completes without finding a greater character in `s1`, return `true`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward comparison approach that leverages the concept of lexicographical order.

```cpp
bool checkIfCanBreak(string s1, string s2) {
    sort(s1.begin(), s1.end());
    sort(s2.begin(), s2.end());
    int n = s1.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s1[i] > s2[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the strings, due to the sorting operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for the sorting operation in the worst case.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The sorting operation dominates the time complexity, and the space complexity is due to the auxiliary space used by the sorting algorithm.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of sorting the entire strings, we can compare the maximum characters in `s1` and `s2` and the minimum characters in `s1` and `s2` to determine if `s1` can break `s2`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Find the maximum and minimum characters in both strings.
  2. Compare the maximum characters in `s1` and `s2`. If the maximum character in `s1` is less than or equal to the maximum character in `s2`, `s1` can break `s2`.
  3. Compare the minimum characters in `s1` and `s2`. If the minimum character in `s1` is greater than or equal to the minimum character in `s2`, `s1` cannot break `s2`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the strings to find the maximum and minimum characters, resulting in a linear time complexity.

```cpp
bool checkIfCanBreak(string s1, string s2) {
    int n = s1.size();
    int max1 = 0, max2 = 0, min1 = INT_MAX, min2 = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        max1 = max(max1, s1[i]);
        max2 = max(max2, s2[i]);
        min1 = min(min1, s1[i]);
        min2 = min(min2, s2[i]);
    }
    return (max1 <= max2 && min1 >= min2) || (max1 >= max2 && min1 <= min2);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the strings.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of space is used.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the strings, resulting in a linear time complexity.
