## Poor Pigs
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem provides three parameters: `buckets` (the number of buckets), `minutesToTest` (the time it takes to test a bucket), and `pigs` (the number of pigs available). The goal is to determine the minimum number of times the pigs must be tested to identify the poisoned bucket.
- Expected output format: The function should return the minimum number of tests required to find the poisoned bucket.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The problem assumes that each test takes `minutesToTest` minutes, and the pigs can be tested multiple times. The function should handle cases where the number of buckets, minutes to test, or number of pigs is 0 or negative.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `poorPigs(1000, 15, 4)`: This test case requires finding the minimum number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bucket among 1000 buckets, given 4 pigs and a test time of 15 minutes.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible combinations of tests to find the poisoned bucket.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over all possible combinations of tests.
  2. For each combination, simulate the testing process and determine if the poisoned bucket can be identified.
  3. Keep track of the minimum number of tests required to identify the poisoned bucket.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is often the most straightforward solution, as it involves exhaustively searching all possible solutions.

```cpp
int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToTest, int pigs) {
    // Initialize the minimum number of tests
    int minTests = INT_MAX;
    
    // Iterate over all possible combinations of tests
    for (int i = 0; i <= minutesToTest; i++) {
        // Calculate the number of tests required for this combination
        int tests = (int)ceil(log(buckets) / log(pigs + 1));
        
        // Update the minimum number of tests
        minTests = min(minTests, tests);
    }
    
    return minTests;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of possible combinations of tests. In this case, $n$ is equal to `minutesToTest + 1`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the algorithm only uses a constant amount of space to store the minimum number of tests.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity due to the exhaustive search over all possible combinations of tests.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using the concept of **information theory** and the **pigeonhole principle**. By testing the pigs in a specific way, we can encode the information about the poisoned bucket into the test results.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the number of tests required to encode the information about the poisoned bucket.
  2. Use the formula $tests = \lceil \log(buckets) / \log(pigs + 1) \rceil$ to calculate the minimum number of tests required.
- Proof of optimality: The optimality of this approach can be proven by showing that any fewer tests would not provide enough information to identify the poisoned bucket.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The optimal approach is based on the fundamental limits of information theory and the pigeonhole principle, making it impossible to further optimize.

```cpp
int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToTest, int pigs) {
    // Calculate the minimum number of tests required
    int tests = (int)ceil(log(buckets) / log(pigs + 1));
    
    return tests;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the algorithm only involves a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the algorithm only uses a constant amount of space to store the minimum number of tests.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach is based on the fundamental limits of information theory and the pigeonhole principle, making it the most efficient solution possible.
