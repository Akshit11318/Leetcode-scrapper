## Flip Game II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` containing only `+` and `-` characters.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^4`.
- Expected output: `true` if there's a way to make all characters in `s` to be `-` by flipping substrings that start and end with `+`, `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements: A substring can be flipped if it starts and ends with `+`.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `s = "++++"`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: Flip the first and last `+` to get `"--++"`, then flip the first and last `+` again to get `"----"`.
  - Input: `s = "+-+"`
    - Output: `false`
    - Explanation: No matter how you flip, you cannot get all `-`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible flips of substrings that start and end with `+`.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible substrings of `s`.
  2. For each substring, check if it starts and ends with `+`.
  3. If it does, flip the substring and check if the resulting string consists only of `-`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive search.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canWin(string s) {
        // Generate all possible substrings
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= s.length(); j++) {
                string substr = s.substr(i, j - i);
                // Check if the substring starts and ends with '+'
                if (substr[0] == '+' && substr[substr.length() - 1] == '+') {
                    // Flip the substring
                    string flipped = s;
                    for (int k = i + 1; k < j - 1; k++) {
                        flipped[k] = (flipped[k] == '+') ? '-' : '+';
                    }
                    // Check if the resulting string consists only of '-'
                    bool allMinus = true;
                    for (char c : flipped) {
                        if (c != '-') {
                            allMinus = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    if (allMinus) return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we generate all possible substrings ($O(n^2)$) and then flip each one, which takes $O(n)$ time in the worst case.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store the flipped substring.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves an exhaustive search, which leads to high time complexity. The space complexity is due to the need to store the flipped substring.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of trying all possible flips, we can use a **backtracking** approach to explore the game tree more efficiently.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Implement a recursive function that tries to flip each possible substring that starts and ends with `+`.
  2. If a flip leads to a state where all characters are `-`, return `true`.
  3. If no flip leads to a winning state, return `false`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it explores the game tree in a depth-first manner, which allows it to prune branches that are guaranteed to not lead to a winning state.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canWin(string s) {
        // Recursive backtracking function
        function<bool(string)> backtrack = [&](string state) {
            // If all characters are '-', return true
            if (allOf(state.begin(), state.end(), [](char c) { return c == '-'; })) {
                return true;
            }
            // Try to flip each possible substring that starts and ends with '+'
            for (int i = 0; i < state.length(); i++) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < state.length(); j++) {
                    if (state[i] == '+' && state[j] == '+') {
                        // Flip the substring
                        string flipped = state;
                        for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                            flipped[k] = (flipped[k] == '+') ? '-' : '+';
                        }
                        // Recursively call the backtrack function
                        if (backtrack(flipped)) return true;
                    }
                }
            }
            // If no flip leads to a winning state, return false
            return false;
        };
        return backtrack(s);
    }
};
```
