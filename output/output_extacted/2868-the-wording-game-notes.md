## The Word Game
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/the-wording-game/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of strings `words` where each word is a string of lowercase English letters, and an integer `k` representing the number of operations allowed.
- Expected output: The maximum number of words that can be changed to a common word in `k` operations.
- Key requirements: 
  - Each operation involves changing a word to a common word.
  - A word can be changed to another word if the difference in their character counts is not more than `k`.
- Edge cases to consider: 
  - Empty input array.
  - `k` is 0 or negative.
- Example test cases:
  - `words = ["abc","cab","bca"]`, `k = 2`. The common word can be "abc" or "cab" or "bca", so the answer is 3.
  - `words = ["abc","def","ghi"]`, `k = 1`. No common word can be formed, so the answer is 0.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to generate all possible combinations of words and check if they can be changed to a common word within `k` operations.
- For each word, calculate the difference in character counts with every other word.
- If the difference is within `k`, consider it as a potential common word.
- Count the maximum number of words that can be changed to a common word.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

int maxWordsChanged(std::vector<std::string>& words, int k) {
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
        std::unordered_map<char, int> count;
        for (char c : words[i]) {
            count[c]++;
        }
        int currentCount = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < words.size(); j++) {
            if (i == j) continue;
            std::unordered_map<char, int> diff;
            for (char c : words[j]) {
                diff[c]++;
            }
            int diffCount = 0;
            for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
                diffCount += std::abs(count[c] - diff[c]);
            }
            if (diffCount <= k) {
                currentCount++;
            }
        }
        maxCount = std::max(maxCount, currentCount);
    }
    return maxCount;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot m \cdot 26)$, where $n$ is the number of words and $m$ is the maximum length of a word. This is because we are comparing each word with every other word, and for each comparison, we are calculating the difference in character counts.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot 26)$, where $m$ is the maximum length of a word. This is because we are storing the count of each character in the word.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are using nested loops to compare each word with every other word. The space complexity occurs because we are storing the count of each character in the word.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the difference in character counts between two words.
- We can use a hash map to store the count of each character in the word, and then calculate the difference in character counts by iterating over the hash map.
- We can also use a more efficient algorithm to find the maximum number of words that can be changed to a common word.
- We can use a binary search approach to find the maximum number of words that can be changed to a common word.

However, the optimal solution can be achieved using a similar approach as the brute force, but with some optimizations. 

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

int maxWordsChanged(std::vector<std::string>& words, int k) {
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
        std::unordered_map<char, int> count;
        for (char c : words[i]) {
            count[c]++;
        }
        int currentCount = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < words.size(); j++) {
            if (i == j) continue;
            std::unordered_map<char, int> diff;
            for (char c : words[j]) {
                diff[c]++;
            }
            int diffCount = 0;
            for (auto& pair : count) {
                diffCount += std::abs(pair.second - diff[pair.first]);
            }
            for (auto& pair : diff) {
                if (count.find(pair.first) == count.end()) {
                    diffCount += pair.second;
                }
            }
            if (diffCount <= k) {
                currentCount++;
            }
        }
        maxCount = std::max(maxCount, currentCount);
    }
    return maxCount + 1; // add 1 for the word itself
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: using hash maps to store the count of each character in the word, and calculating the difference in character counts by iterating over the hash map.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using a brute force approach and then optimizing it to achieve the optimal solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: using hash maps to store the count of each character in the word, and calculating the difference in character counts by iterating over the hash map.
- Similar problems to practice: problems that involve calculating the difference in character counts between two words, or problems that involve using hash maps to store the count of each character in the word.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not initializing the hash map, or not checking if a character is present in the hash map before accessing it.
- Edge cases to watch for: empty input array, or `k` is 0 or negative.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach without optimizing it, or using a data structure that is not suitable for the problem.
- Testing considerations: testing the function with different input arrays and values of `k`, and checking if the function returns the correct result.
