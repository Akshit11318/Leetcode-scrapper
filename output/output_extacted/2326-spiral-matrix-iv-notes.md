## Spiral Matrix IV
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iv/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two integers `m` and `n`, return a spiral matrix filled with numbers from 1 to `m * n` in a spiral pattern, starting from the center.
- Expected output format: A 2D vector of integers representing the spiral matrix.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input integers `m` and `n` are positive, and the spiral pattern starts from the center of the matrix.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `m = 3`, `n = 5`, output: `[[1,2,3,4,5],[16,17,18,19,6],[15,24,25,20,7],[14,23,22,21,8],[13,12,11,10,9]]`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating through the matrix in a spiral pattern, filling in the numbers from 1 to `m * n`. We can achieve this by maintaining four pointers (top, bottom, left, right) to represent the current boundaries of the matrix.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize the matrix with zeros and the four pointers.
  2. Iterate through the matrix in a spiral pattern, filling in the numbers.
  3. Update the pointers after each iteration.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is straightforward and easy to understand, making it a natural starting point.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> spiralMatrixIV(int m, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> matrix(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    int top = 0, bottom = m - 1, left = 0, right = n - 1;
    int num = 1;
    while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
        // Fill in the top row
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            matrix[top][i] = num++;
        }
        top++;
        
        // Fill in the right column
        for (int i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
            matrix[i][right] = num++;
        }
        right--;
        
        // Fill in the bottom row
        if (top <= bottom) {
            for (int i = right; i >= left; i--) {
                matrix[bottom][i] = num++;
            }
            bottom--;
        }
        
        // Fill in the left column
        if (left <= right) {
            for (int i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
                matrix[i][left] = num++;
            }
            left++;
        }
    }
    return matrix;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the matrix. This is because we iterate through each element in the matrix once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the matrix. This is because we need to store the entire matrix.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is $O(m \cdot n)$ because we iterate through each element in the matrix once. The space complexity is also $O(m \cdot n)$ because we need to store the entire matrix.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach, as it already has a time complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$, which is the minimum required to fill in the entire matrix.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach involves iterating through the matrix in a spiral pattern, filling in the numbers from 1 to `m * n`. We can achieve this by maintaining four pointers (top, bottom, left, right) to represent the current boundaries of the matrix.
- Proof of optimality: The optimal approach has a time complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$, which is the minimum required to fill in the entire matrix. Therefore, it is optimal.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we need to iterate through each element in the matrix at least once to fill it in.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> spiralMatrixIV(int m, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> matrix(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    int top = 0, bottom = m - 1, left = 0, right = n - 1;
    int num = 1;
    while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
        // Fill in the top row
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            matrix[top][i] = num++;
        }
        top++;
        
        // Fill in the right column
        for (int i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
            matrix[i][right] = num++;
        }
        right--;
        
        // Fill in the bottom row
        if (top <= bottom) {
            for (int i = right; i >= left; i--) {
                matrix[bottom][i] = num++;
            }
            bottom--;
        }
        
        // Fill in the left column
        if (left <= right) {
            for (int i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
                matrix[i][left] = num++;
            }
            left++;
        }
    }
    return matrix;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iterating through a matrix in a spiral pattern, maintaining pointers to represent boundaries.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Filling in a matrix with numbers in a specific pattern.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, as the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Filling in a matrix with numbers in different patterns.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to update the pointers after each iteration, filling in the wrong elements.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `m` or `n` is 1, the matrix is a single row or column.
- Performance pitfalls: None, as the optimal approach has a time complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input values for `m` and `n`, including edge cases.
