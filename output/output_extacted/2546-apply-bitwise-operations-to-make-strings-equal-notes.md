## Apply Bitwise Operations to Make Strings Equal
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-bitwise-operations-to-make-strings-equal/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two binary strings `s` and `target`.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length, target.length <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations to make `s` equal to `target`.
- Key requirements: Use bitwise operations to transform `s` into `target`.
- Edge cases: When `s` and `target` have different lengths, the problem is not well-defined. However, in the context of this problem, we assume that both strings have the same length.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Example 1: `s = "1101", target = "0011"` - Output: `6`
- Example 2: `s = "10", target = "00"` - Output: `3`

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of bitwise operations to transform `s` into `target`.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR) for each character in `s`.
  2. Apply each combination to `s` and check if the result equals `target`.
  3. Count the minimum number of operations required to transform `s` into `target`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int minOperations(const std::string& s, const std::string& target) {
    int n = s.length();
    int result = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all possible combinations of bitwise operations
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << (2 * n)); i++) {
        std::string temp = s;
        
        // Apply each combination to s
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int op = (i >> (2 * j)) & 3;
            
            if (op == 1) {  // AND
                temp[j] = (temp[j] == '1' && target[j] == '1') ? '1' : '0';
            } else if (op == 2) {  // OR
                temp[j] = (temp[j] == '1' || target[j] == '1') ? '1' : '0';
            } else if (op == 3) {  // XOR
                temp[j] = (temp[j] != target[j]) ? '1' : '0';
            }
        }
        
        // Count the minimum number of operations required
        int count = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (temp[j] != s[j]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        // Update the result if a smaller number of operations is found
        if (temp == target) {
            result = std::min(result, count);
        }
    }
    
    return result == INT_MAX ? -1 : result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{2n} \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates all possible combinations of bitwise operations, resulting in exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the temporary string used to store the result of each combination.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The minimum number of operations required to transform `s` into `target` is equal to the number of different bits between `s` and `target`.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Count the number of different bits between `s` and `target`.
  2. The minimum number of operations required is equal to the count of different bits.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int minOperations(const std::string& s, const std::string& target) {
    int n = s.length();
    int count = 0;
    
    // Count the number of different bits between s and target
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s[i] != target[i]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach has a linear time complexity, which is the best possible complexity for this problem since we need to compare each bit of `s` and `target` at least once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Bitwise operations, string manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Counting different bits between two strings.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the problem to a simple bit comparison.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation problems involving bitwise operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly applying bitwise operations, not counting different bits correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Different lengths of `s` and `target`, handling cases where `s` and `target` are equal.
- Performance pitfalls: Using brute force approaches for large inputs, not optimizing the solution for linear time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different lengths of `s` and `target`, testing with equal and unequal strings.
