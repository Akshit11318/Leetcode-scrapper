## Least Operators to Express Number

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/least-operators-to-express-number/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: The problem takes two integers, `x` and `target`, where `x` is the base number and `target` is the target number.
- Constraints: `2 <= x <= 100`, `1 <= target <= 10^9`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operators required to express the `target` number using the base `x`.
- Key requirements: Use the base `x` and the four basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to express the `target` number.
- Edge cases: Handle cases where `target` is less than `x` or `x` is greater than `target`.
- Example test cases:
  - `x = 3, target = 11`, output: `3` (3 * 3 + 2).
  - `x = 100, target = 100000000`, output: `3` (100 * 100 * 1000).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves trying all possible combinations of operators and numbers to find the minimum number of operators required to express the `target` number.
- This approach involves using a recursive function to try all possible combinations of operators and numbers.
- However, this approach is not efficient and will result in a time limit exceeded error for large inputs.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int leastOperatorsToExpressNumber(int x, int target) {
    int minOperators = INT_MAX;

    // Recursive function to try all possible combinations of operators and numbers
    function<void(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int curr, int operators, int index) {
        if (curr == target) {
            minOperators = min(minOperators, operators);
            return;
        }

        if (curr > target || operators > minOperators) {
            return;
        }

        // Try all possible operators
        dfs(curr + x, operators + 1, index + 1);
        dfs(curr - x, operators + 1, index + 1);
        dfs(curr * x, operators + 1, index + 1);
        if (curr % x == 0) {
            dfs(curr / x, operators + 1, index + 1);
        }
    };

    dfs(1, 0, 0);

    return minOperators;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(4^n)$, where $n$ is the number of digits in the `target` number.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of digits in the `target` number.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations of operators and numbers, resulting in an exponential time complexity. The recursive function call stack also uses linear space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the minimum number of operators required to express the `target` number.
- We start with the base number `x` and try all possible operators to get the next number.
- We use a queue to store the numbers to be processed and a set to store the visited numbers.
- We stop when we find the `target` number or when the queue is empty.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int leastOperatorsToExpressNumber(int x, int target) {
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    unordered_set<int> visited;

    q.push({1, 0});
    visited.insert(1);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int curr = q.front().first;
        int operators = q.front().second;
        q.pop();

        if (curr == target) {
            return operators;
        }

        // Try all possible operators
        vector<pair<int, char>> next = {{curr + x, '+'}, {curr - x, '-'}, {curr * x, '*'}};
        if (curr % x == 0) {
            next.push_back({curr / x, '/'});
        }

        for (auto& p : next) {
            if (visited.find(p.first) == visited.end() && p.first <= target) {
                q.push({p.first, operators + 1});
                visited.insert(p.first);
            }
        }
    }

    return -1; // Not found
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of digits in the `target` number.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of digits in the `target` number.
> - **Optimality proof:** The BFS algorithm guarantees that we find the minimum number of operators required to express the `target` number, as we try all possible operators in a level order.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: BFS, recursive functions, and memoization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using BFS to find the minimum number of operations.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a queue and a set to store the numbers to be processed and the visited numbers.
- Similar problems to practice: finding the minimum number of operations to transform one string to another.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking for visited numbers, not handling edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: `target` is less than `x` or `x` is greater than `target`.
- Performance pitfalls: using a recursive function without memoization, not using a queue to store the numbers to be processed.
- Testing considerations: testing with different inputs, including edge cases.
