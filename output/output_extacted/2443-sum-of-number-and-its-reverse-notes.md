## Sum of Number and Its Reverse
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-number-and-its-reverse/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given a non-negative integer `num`, return `true` if the sum of `num` and its reverse is a palindrome. Otherwise, return `false`.
- Input format and constraints: `0 <= num <= 10^9`
- Expected output format: boolean value indicating whether the sum is a palindrome
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: handling large numbers, correctly reversing the number, checking for palindrome
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `num = 181`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: The reverse of `181` is `181`, and `181 + 181 = 362`. `362` is not a palindrome, but we must check other numbers.
  - Input: `num = 0`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: The sum of `0` and its reverse `0` is `0`, which is a palindrome.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves calculating the reverse of the given number and then checking if their sum is a palindrome.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Calculate the reverse of the input number.
  2. Sum the original number and its reverse.
  3. Check if the sum is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool sumOfNumberAndReverse(int num) {
        // Function to reverse a number
        int reverse(int n) {
            int res = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                res = res * 10 + n % 10;
                n /= 10;
            }
            return res;
        }
        
        // Function to check if a number is a palindrome
        bool isPalindrome(int n) {
            return n == reverse(n);
        }
        
        // Calculate the reverse of the input number
        int revNum = reverse(num);
        
        // Sum the original number and its reverse
        int sum = num + revNum;
        
        // Check if the sum is a palindrome
        return isPalindrome(sum);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(log(n))$ because we are performing operations that scale with the number of digits in `n`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the output, as we are using a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the while loop that reverses the number and checks for palindrome, which iterates over each digit of the number once. The space complexity is constant because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the reverse and sum of the numbers.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to realize that we can directly check all possible sums of `num` and its reverse without explicitly calculating the reverse and checking if it's a palindrome.
- However, since we must determine if there exists a reverse that, when added to the original number, results in a palindrome, we can simply iterate through possible reverses and check for the palindrome condition directly.
- Given the constraints, this approach remains efficient as it doesn't significantly deviate from the brute force in terms of complexity but offers a clearer path to the solution by focusing on the condition that needs to be met (i.e., the sum being a palindrome).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool sumOfNumberAndReverse(int num) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= num; i++) {
            int sum = num + i;
            string strSum = to_string(sum);
            string revStrSum = strSum;
            reverse(revStrSum.begin(), revStrSum.end());
            if (strSum == revStrSum) {
                int revNum = i;
                string strRevNum = to_string(revNum);
                string strNum = to_string(num);
                reverse(strRevNum.begin(), strRevNum.end());
                if (strNum == strRevNum) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
However, the previous optimal solution provided doesn't align well with an optimal strategy for this specific problem. The actual optimal approach should directly focus on the condition that makes a number and its reverse sum up to a palindrome, without needing to iterate through all possible reverses or explicitly checking each sum. The correct optimal approach simplifies the problem by understanding that we are looking for any reverse of `num` that when added to `num` gives a palindrome, which can be more efficiently checked by considering the properties of palindromes and the structure of the sum.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool sumOfNumberAndReverse(int num) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000000; i++) {
            int reverse = 0, temp = i;
            while (temp > 0) {
                reverse = reverse * 10 + temp % 10;
                temp /= 10;
            }
            if (isPalindrome(num + reverse)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    bool isPalindrome(int n) {
        int reverse = 0, temp = n;
        while (temp > 0) {
            reverse = reverse * 10 + temp % 10;
            temp /= 10;
        }
        return n == reverse;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot log(n))$ due to the loop through possible numbers and the operation to reverse and check for palindrome.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the output, as we are using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is considered optimal under the given constraints because it systematically checks all possible scenarios without unnecessary redundancy, focusing on the core requirement of finding a sum that is a palindrome.
