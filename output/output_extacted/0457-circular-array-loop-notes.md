## Circular Array Loop
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-array-loop/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums` where each element represents a jump step.
- Constraints: The input array is non-empty and contains at most $10^4$ elements, with each element in the range $[-10^4, 10^4]$.
- Expected output format: A boolean indicating whether there exists a loop in the array.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array is considered circular, meaning that the last element connects back to the first element. A loop exists if we can start at any index and follow the jumps to return to the starting index.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `nums = [2,-1,1,2,2]`: True, because we can start at index 0 and follow the jumps to return to index 0.
  - `nums = [-1,2]`: False, because we cannot start at any index and follow the jumps to return to the starting index.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To detect a loop, we can try all possible starting indices and follow the jumps until we either return to the starting index or reach a point where we cannot continue (e.g., we reach an index that points outside the array or we reach a cycle that does not include the starting index).
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each index in the array.
  2. For each index, follow the jumps until we either return to the starting index or cannot continue.
  3. If we return to the starting index, then a loop exists.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward to understand and implement, as it directly addresses the problem statement by simulating the process of following jumps from each index.

```cpp
bool circularArrayLoop(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        bool forward = nums[i] > 0;
        int slow = i, fast = i;
        do {
            slow = findNextIndex(nums, slow, forward);
            if (slow == -1) break;
            fast = findNextIndex(nums, fast, forward);
            if (fast == -1) break;
            fast = findNextIndex(nums, fast, forward);
            if (fast == -1) break;
            if (slow == fast) return true;
        } while (slow != -1 && fast != -1);
    }
    return false;
}

int findNextIndex(vector<int>& nums, int currentIndex, bool forward) {
    bool direction = nums[currentIndex] >= 0;
    if (forward != direction) return -1;
    int nextIndex = (currentIndex + nums[currentIndex]) % nums.size();
    if (nextIndex < 0) nextIndex += nums.size();
    if (nextIndex == currentIndex) nextIndex = -1;
    return nextIndex;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because in the worst case, for each starting index, we might have to traverse the entire array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the indices and the direction of the jump.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are simulating the process of following jumps from each index, which can result in a lot of repeated work. The space complexity is low because we do not need to store any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of trying all possible starting indices and following the jumps, we can use a more efficient algorithm that detects cycles in the array. We can treat the array as a graph where each index is a node, and the jump at each index is a directed edge to another node. Then, we can use a cycle detection algorithm such as Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate over each index in the array.
  2. For each index, use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect a cycle.
  3. If a cycle is detected, return true.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best we can achieve for this problem since we must at least read the input array once.

```cpp
bool circularArrayLoop(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        bool forward = nums[i] > 0;
        int slow = i, fast = i;
        do {
            slow = findNextIndex(nums, slow, forward);
            if (slow == -1) break;
            fast = findNextIndex(nums, fast, forward);
            if (fast == -1) break;
            fast = findNextIndex(nums, fast, forward);
            if (fast == -1) break;
            if (slow == fast) return true;
        } while (slow != -1 && fast != -1);
    }
    return false;
}

int findNextIndex(vector<int>& nums, int currentIndex, bool forward) {
    bool direction = nums[currentIndex] >= 0;
    if (forward != direction) return -1;
    int nextIndex = (currentIndex + nums[currentIndex]) % nums.size();
    if (nextIndex < 0) nextIndex += nums.size();
    if (nextIndex == currentIndex) nextIndex = -1;
    return nextIndex;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect cycles, which has a linear time complexity.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the indices and the direction of the jump.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has the best possible time complexity for this problem, which is linear. We must at least read the input array once, so we cannot achieve a better time complexity than $O(n)$.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases correctly, such as when the input array is empty or contains only one element.
- Edge cases to watch for: When the input array contains only one element, or when the array is empty.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that has a high time complexity, such as $O(n^2)$.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input arrays, including edge cases and large inputs.
