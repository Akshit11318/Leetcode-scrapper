## Angle Between Hands of a Clock
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/angle-between-hands-of-a-clock/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `hour` and an integer `minutes`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq hour \leq 12$, $0 \leq minutes \leq 59$.
- Expected output: The smaller angle between the hour and the minute hand.
- Key requirements: Calculate the angles of the hour and minute hands and find the smaller angle between them.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `hour = 3`, `minutes = 30`
  - Output: `75`
  - Explanation: The hour hand is at 3:30, which is 75 degrees away from the 12 o'clock position. The minute hand is at the 6 o'clock position.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to calculate the angle of each hand from the 12 o'clock position and then find the absolute difference between these two angles.
- However, this approach does not directly consider the smaller angle between the hands.

```cpp
int angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
    double hourAngle = (hour % 12 + minutes / 60.0) * 30;  // Each hour is 30 degrees
    double minuteAngle = minutes * 6;  // Each minute is 6 degrees
    double angle = abs(hourAngle - minuteAngle);
    if (angle > 180) angle = 360 - angle;  // Ensure the smaller angle is returned
    return (int)angle;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as this solution involves constant-time operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as it uses a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The operations are basic arithmetic and do not depend on the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- This approach is similar to the brute force but is more refined and directly calculates the smaller angle.
- It considers the positions of both hands and calculates the angle based on their relative positions.

```cpp
int angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
    double hourAngle = (hour % 12 + minutes / 60.0) * 30;
    double minuteAngle = minutes * 6;
    double angle = abs(hourAngle - minuteAngle);
    return (int)min(angle, 360 - angle);  // Directly return the smaller angle
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the operations are constant-time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as it uses a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution directly calculates the smaller angle between the two hands of the clock with the minimum number of operations, making it optimal.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Direct calculation and consideration of relative positions.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Calculating angles based on the positions of objects (in this case, clock hands).
- Optimization techniques learned: Directly considering the smaller angle between two positions.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving geometric calculations or relative positions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to consider the smaller angle or misinterpreting the positions of the clock hands.
- Edge cases to watch for: When the hour or minute is at the boundary (e.g., 12 o'clock or 59 minutes).
- Performance pitfalls: Overcomplicating the calculation with unnecessary steps.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various inputs, including edge cases like 12:00, 6:30, and 11:59.
