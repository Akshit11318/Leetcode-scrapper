## Stone Game VI
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-vi/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem provides two arrays of integers, `aliceValues` and `bobValues`, both of length `n`, representing the values of stones for Alice and Bob, respectively. The goal is to determine the score for Alice in a game where players take turns picking stones based on their total value (sum of Alice's value and Bob's value for a stone).
- Expected output format: The function should return the maximum score Alice can achieve.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The game involves strategic selection of stones to maximize the score for Alice. The key requirement is to find a strategy that allows Alice to pick stones in a way that maximizes her score, considering that Bob will also try to maximize his score.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `aliceValues = [1,3]` and `bobValues = [2,1]`, Alice should pick the stone with value 3 for her and 2 for Bob first, then the stone with value 1 for her and 1 for Bob, resulting in a score of 3 + 1 = 4 for Alice.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to try all possible combinations of picking stones and calculate the score for each combination. This involves simulating the game for all possible sequences of stone picks.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of the stones.
  2. For each permutation, simulate the game by alternating between Alice and Bob picking stones based on the permutation.
  3. Calculate the score for Alice for each permutation.
  4. Keep track of the maximum score found.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int stoneGameVI(vector<int>& aliceValues, vector<int>& bobValues) {
    int n = aliceValues.size();
    vector<pair<int, int>> stones;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        stones.push_back({aliceValues[i], bobValues[i]});
    }
    
    int maxScore = INT_MIN;
    
    // Simulate all permutations
    do {
        int score = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                score += stones[i].first;
            }
        }
        maxScore = max(maxScore, score);
    } while (next_permutation(stones.begin(), stones.end()));
    
    return maxScore;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$, because we are generating all permutations of the stones.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the permutations and the stones.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves trying all possible sequences of stone picks, which results in factorial time complexity due to the permutations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight here is to realize that the optimal strategy for Alice is to pick the stones that have the maximum sum of Alice's value and Bob's value first. This is because the game is about maximizing the total value, and picking stones with higher total values first gives Alice an advantage.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Combine the values for Alice and Bob into pairs.
  2. Sort these pairs in descending order based on the sum of Alice's and Bob's values.
  3. Alice picks the stones in the order of the sorted pairs, which maximizes her score.

```cpp
int stoneGameVI(vector<int>& aliceValues, vector<int>& bobValues) {
    int n = aliceValues.size();
    vector<pair<int, int>> stones;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        stones.push_back({aliceValues[i] + bobValues[i], aliceValues[i]});
    }
    
    sort(stones.begin(), stones.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>& b) {
        return a.first > b.first;
    });
    
    int score = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {
        score += stones[i].second;
    }
    
    return score;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, due to sorting the stones based on their total values.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the stones and their combined values.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it ensures Alice picks the stones with the highest total value first, maximizing her score given the game's rules.
