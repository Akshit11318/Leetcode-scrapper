## Reformat Department Table

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reformat-department-table/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A table `Department` with columns `id`, `revenue`, and `department_id`.
- Expected output format: A table with columns `id`, `revenue`, and `department_id`, where the `department_id` is not `NULL`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The `id` column is unique.
  - The `department_id` column may contain `NULL` values.
  - The `revenue` column contains numeric values.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: 
    - Input: `Department` table with some rows having `NULL` `department_id`.
    - Expected output: A table where `department_id` is not `NULL`.
  - Example 2: 
    - Input: `Department` table with all rows having `department_id` as `NULL`.
    - Expected output: An empty table.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over each row in the `Department` table, and for each row, check if the `department_id` is `NULL`. If it is, remove that row from the table.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty table to store the result.
  2. Iterate over each row in the `Department` table.
  3. For each row, check if the `department_id` is `NULL`.
  4. If the `department_id` is not `NULL`, add that row to the result table.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach to solve the problem.

```cpp
// SQL query to solve the problem
SELECT id, revenue, department_id
FROM Department
WHERE department_id IS NOT NULL;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Department` table, because we are iterating over each row once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might need to store all rows in the result table.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating over each row in the table, and the space complexity occurs because we are storing the result in a new table.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using a simple SQL query with a `WHERE` clause to filter out rows with `NULL` `department_id`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The SQL query selects all columns (`id`, `revenue`, and `department_id`) from the `Department` table where the `department_id` is not `NULL`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the minimum time complexity required to solve the problem, as we need to iterate over each row in the table at least once.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we need to iterate over each row in the table to check if the `department_id` is `NULL`, and this requires at least $O(n)$ time complexity.

```cpp
// SQL query to solve the problem
SELECT id, revenue, department_id
FROM Department
WHERE department_id IS NOT NULL;
```

> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because we need to iterate over each row in the table at least once to check if the `department_id` is `NULL`.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration over a table, filtering out rows based on a condition.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a `WHERE` clause to filter out rows in a SQL query.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, as the problem has a simple and optimal solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Other SQL query problems that involve filtering out rows based on conditions.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to include the `WHERE` clause, or using `department_id = NULL` instead of `department_id IS NULL`.
- Edge cases to watch for: Rows with `NULL` `department_id`, and an empty table.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a subquery or a join instead of a simple `WHERE` clause, which can lead to slower performance.
- Testing considerations: Test the query with a table that has rows with `NULL` `department_id`, and with an empty table.
