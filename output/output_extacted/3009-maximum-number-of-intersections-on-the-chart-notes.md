## Maximum Number of Intersections on the Chart
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-intersections-on-the-chart/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input will be a list of integers representing the `x` coordinates and another list of integers representing the `y` coordinates. The constraints are that the input lists will have the same length, and the length will be between 1 and 1000.
- Expected output format: The function should return the maximum number of intersections that can occur on the chart.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The key requirement is to find the maximum number of intersections that can occur on the chart. Edge cases include when the input lists have only one element, or when all elements in the input lists are the same.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given the input `x = [1, 2, 3]` and `y = [2, 3, 4]`, the output should be `2`, because the maximum number of intersections that can occur on the chart is 2.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The initial thought process is to iterate through all possible pairs of lines and count the number of intersections.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize a variable `intersections` to 0.
  2. Iterate through all possible pairs of lines.
  3. For each pair of lines, check if they intersect.
  4. If they intersect, increment `intersections`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach comes to mind first because it is a straightforward way to solve the problem. However, it has a high time complexity due to the nested loops.

```cpp
int maxIntersections(vector<int>& x, vector<int>& y) {
    int intersections = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < x.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < x.size(); j++) {
            int x1 = x[i], y1 = y[i];
            int x2 = x[j], y2 = y[j];
            if (x1 == x2) continue; // vertical lines do not intersect
            double m1 = (y2 - y1) * 1.0 / (x2 - x1);
            double b1 = y1 - m1 * x1;
            for (int k = 0; k < x.size(); k++) {
                for (int l = k + 1; l < x.size(); l++) {
                    int x3 = x[k], y3 = y[k];
                    int x4 = x[l], y4 = y[l];
                    if (x3 == x4) continue; // vertical lines do not intersect
                    double m2 = (y4 - y3) * 1.0 / (x4 - x3);
                    double b2 = y3 - m2 * x3;
                    if (m1 == m2 && b1 == b2) continue; // parallel lines
                    double x_intersect = (b2 - b1) / (m1 - m2);
                    double y_intersect = m1 * x_intersect + b1;
                    if (min(x1, x2) <= x_intersect && x_intersect <= max(x1, x2) &&
                        min(y1, y2) <= y_intersect && y_intersect <= max(y1, y2) &&
                        min(x3, x4) <= x_intersect && x_intersect <= max(x3, x4) &&
                        min(y3, y4) <= y_intersect && y_intersect <= max(y3, y4)) {
                        intersections++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return intersections / 2; // divide by 2 to avoid counting the same intersection twice
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^4)$, where $n$ is the length of the input lists. This is because we have four nested loops.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the `intersections` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we have four nested loops, and the space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a hashmap to store the lines and their corresponding slopes and y-intercepts.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize a hashmap `lines` to store the lines and their corresponding slopes and y-intercepts.
  2. Iterate through the input lists and calculate the slope and y-intercept of each line.
  3. Store the slope and y-intercept in the `lines` hashmap.
  4. Iterate through the `lines` hashmap and count the number of intersections.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a lower time complexity than the brute force approach.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we have to iterate through the input lists and the `lines` hashmap, and we cannot do this in less than linear time.

```cpp
int maxIntersections(vector<int>& x, vector<int>& y) {
    map<pair<double, double>, int> lines;
    for (int i = 0; i < x.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < x.size(); j++) {
            int x1 = x[i], y1 = y[i];
            int x2 = x[j], y2 = y[j];
            if (x1 == x2) {
                lines[make_pair(INFINITY, x1)]++;
            } else {
                double m = (y2 - y1) * 1.0 / (x2 - x1);
                double b = y1 - m * x1;
                lines[make_pair(m, b)]++;
            }
        }
    }
    int max_intersections = 0;
    for (auto& line : lines) {
        max_intersections = max(max_intersections, line.second * (line.second - 1) / 2);
    }
    return max_intersections;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The key algorithmic concepts demonstrated are the use of a hashmap to store the lines and their corresponding slopes and y-intercepts, and the use of the formula for the number of intersections between two lines.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem-solving pattern identified is the use of a hashmap to store the lines and their corresponding slopes and y-intercepts, and the use of the formula for the number of intersections between two lines.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimization technique learned is the use of a hashmap to store the lines and their corresponding slopes and y-intercepts, which reduces the time complexity of the algorithm.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: A common implementation error is to forget to handle the case where two lines are parallel, or to forget to handle the case where two lines are vertical.
- Edge cases to watch for: Edge cases to watch for include when the input lists have only one element, or when all elements in the input lists are the same.
- Performance pitfalls: A performance pitfall is to use a brute force approach, which has a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing considerations include testing the algorithm with different input sizes, and testing the algorithm with different types of input data.
