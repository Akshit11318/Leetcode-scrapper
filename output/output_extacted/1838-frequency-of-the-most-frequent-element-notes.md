## Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: The length of `nums` is in the range `[1, 2 * 10^4]`, and `k` is in the range `[1, 2 * 10^4]`.
- Expected output format: The maximum possible frequency of an element after at most `k` removals.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The frequency of an element is the number of times it appears in the array. We can remove elements from the array to increase the frequency of the most frequent element.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `nums = [1, 2, 4], k = 5`, the output should be `3`. We can remove all elements except `1` to get `[1, 1, 1]`.
  - Example 2: `nums = [1, 4, 8, 13], k = 5`, the output should be `2`. We can remove `8` and `13` to get `[1, 4, 1, 4]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of removing elements to find the maximum possible frequency.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `max_freq` to store the maximum possible frequency.
  2. Iterate over all possible combinations of removing elements from the array.
  3. For each combination, calculate the frequency of each element.
  4. Update `max_freq` if the maximum frequency in the current combination is greater than `max_freq`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that tries all possible combinations to find the maximum possible frequency.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxFrequency(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int max_freq = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= nums.size(); j++) {
            std::vector<int> temp = nums;
            for (int l = i; l < j; l++) {
                if (temp[l] != nums[i]) {
                    temp[l] = -1;
                }
            }
            int freq = 0;
            for (int l = 0; l < temp.size(); l++) {
                if (temp[l] != -1) {
                    freq++;
                }
            }
            if (freq <= nums.size() - k) {
                max_freq = std::max(max_freq, freq);
            }
        }
    }
    return max_freq;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we're trying all possible combinations of removing elements, which has a time complexity of $O(2^n)$, and for each combination, we're calculating the frequency of each element, which has a time complexity of $O(n)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we're creating a temporary array to store the current combination of elements.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity occurs because we're trying all possible combinations of removing elements, which is an exponential operation. The space complexity occurs because we're creating a temporary array to store the current combination of elements.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a sliding window approach to find the maximum possible frequency.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the array.
  2. Initialize a variable `max_freq` to store the maximum possible frequency.
  3. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of the elements in the current window.
  4. Iterate over the array, moving the `right` pointer to the right.
  5. For each position of the `right` pointer, calculate the sum of the elements in the current window.
  6. If the sum of the elements in the current window is greater than `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right.
  7. Update `max_freq` if the size of the current window is greater than `max_freq`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it tries all possible combinations of removing elements, but it does so in a more efficient way than the brute force approach.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxFrequency(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int max_freq = 0;
    int left = 0;
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
        sum += nums[right];
        while ((long long)(right - left + 1) * nums[right] - sum > k) {
            sum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
        max_freq = std::max(max_freq, right - left + 1);
    }
    return max_freq;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we're sorting the array, which has a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, and then iterating over the array, which has a time complexity of $O(n)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we're not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it tries all possible combinations of removing elements in a more efficient way than the brute force approach.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sliding window approach, sorting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a sliding window to find the maximum possible frequency.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a more efficient algorithm to try all possible combinations of removing elements.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding the maximum possible frequency of an element in an array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, not handling the case where the sum of the elements in the current window is greater than `k`.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where the input array is empty, the case where `k` is 0.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach to try all possible combinations of removing elements.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input arrays and values of `k`.
