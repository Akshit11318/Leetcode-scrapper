## Minimum Division Operations to Make Array Non-Decreasing
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-division-operations-to-make-array-non-decreasing/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of integers `nums`, where `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`. The goal is to make the array non-decreasing by performing the minimum number of division operations.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of division operations required.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The division operation can only be applied to the current element to make it smaller. We need to consider the optimal strategy to minimize the number of operations.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `nums = [4, 3, 6, 4, 7, 3]`, the output should be `4`. We can perform the following operations: `4 -> 2`, `6 -> 3`, `7 -> 3`, and `4 -> 2`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to try all possible division operations for each element and see which sequence of operations leads to a non-decreasing array with the minimum number of operations.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the minimum number of operations.
  2. Iterate through the array and for each element, try all possible division operations.
  3. For each division operation, check if the resulting array is non-decreasing.
  4. If the array is non-decreasing, update the minimum number of operations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that tries all possible solutions, but it's inefficient due to its high time complexity.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            for (int k = 1; k <= nums[j]; k++) {
                if (nums[j] % k == 0) {
                    int temp = nums[j];
                    nums[j] = k;
                    if (isNonDecreasing(nums)) {
                        minOps = min(minOps, countDivisions(temp, k));
                    }
                    nums[j] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return minOps;
}

bool isNonDecreasing(vector<int>& nums) {
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int countDivisions(int a, int b) {
    int count = 0;
    while (a > b) {
        a /= 2;
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot max(nums) \cdot log(max(nums)))$, where $n$ is the length of the input array and $max(nums)$ is the maximum value in the array. This is because we have three nested loops: one for iterating through the array, one for trying all possible division operations, and one for counting the number of divisions.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum number of operations and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity occurs because we try all possible division operations for each element, which leads to an exponential number of possibilities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a greedy approach. We start from the second element and try to make it smaller than or equal to the previous element by performing the minimum number of division operations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the minimum number of operations.
  2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
  3. For each element, calculate the minimum number of division operations required to make it smaller than or equal to the previous element.
  4. Update the minimum number of operations.
- Proof of optimality: The greedy approach is optimal because we always choose the minimum number of division operations for each element, which leads to the minimum total number of operations.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int minOps = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            int divisions = log2(nums[i] / nums[i - 1]) + 1;
            minOps += divisions;
            nums[i] /= (1 << divisions);
        }
    }
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because we only iterate through the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum number of operations and other variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** The greedy approach is optimal because we always choose the minimum number of division operations for each element, which leads to the minimum total number of operations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy algorithms, bit manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a greedy approach to solve problems that require finding the minimum or maximum value.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using bit manipulation to calculate the number of division operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that require finding the minimum or maximum value using a greedy approach.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty input array.
- Edge cases to watch for: An empty input array, an input array with a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach, which can lead to high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the code with different input arrays, including edge cases.
