## Clumsy Factorial
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/clumsy-factorial/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the input number for the clumsy factorial calculation. The input `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
- Expected output format: The function should return the result of the clumsy factorial calculation as an integer.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The clumsy factorial is calculated by alternating between addition and multiplication operations starting from the input number `n` down to 1. For example, `clumsy(4)` would be calculated as `4 * 3 + 2 * 1`.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - `clumsy(4)` should return `7` because `4 * 3 + 2 * 1 = 12 + 2 = 14`.
  - `clumsy(10)` should return `12` because `10 * 9 + 8 / 7 + 6 * 5 + 4 / 3 + 2 * 1`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach to solving this problem is to directly follow the definition of the clumsy factorial. We can iterate from `n` down to `1`, applying the operations as specified.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize the result with the value of `n`.
  2. Iterate from `n-1` down to `1`, applying the operations in an alternating manner.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the problem's definition, making it straightforward to implement.

```cpp
int clumsy(int n) {
    long result = n; // Use long to avoid overflow
    int operation = 0; // 0 for multiplication, 1 for addition
    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        if (operation % 2 == 0) {
            // Multiplication operation
            result *= i;
        } else {
            // Addition operation
            result += i;
        }
        operation++;
    }
    return (int)result; // Cast back to int
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ because we iterate from `n` down to `1`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of space to store the result and the operation counter.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The iteration over the range from `n` to `1` causes the linear time complexity, and the use of a fixed amount of space for variables leads to constant space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can directly calculate the result by following the order of operations without needing to explicitly iterate over each number from `n` to `1` with separate operations for multiplication and addition. This involves treating the sequence as a series of operations that can be simplified based on the rules provided.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize the result with `n`.
  2. Iterate from `n-1` to `1`, applying the operations in the specified order.
  3. To simplify, consider that every third number (starting from `n-1`) will be divided, and the pattern of operations can help in simplifying the calculation.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the result without any unnecessary steps, taking into account the specific pattern of operations in the clumsy factorial.

```cpp
int clumsy(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    if (n == 3) return 6;
    
    long result = n;
    bool isMultiply = true; // Flag to track operation type
    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        if (isMultiply) {
            result *= i;
        } else if (i % 2 == 0) { // For even numbers, perform division
            result /= i;
        } else { // For odd numbers, perform addition
            result += i;
        }
        isMultiply = !isMultiply; // Toggle operation type
    }
    return (int)result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we still need to iterate over the range from `n` to `1`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most straightforward and efficient way to calculate the clumsy factorial, as it directly follows the operation pattern without introducing unnecessary complexity.
