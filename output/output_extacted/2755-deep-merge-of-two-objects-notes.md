## Deep Merge of Two Objects

**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/deep-merge-of-two-objects/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/deep-merge-of-two-objects/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes two objects as input and requires a deep merge of these objects. The input objects can contain nested objects and arrays.
- Expected output format: The output should be a new object that is the result of the deep merge of the two input objects.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: If both objects have the same key and the values are objects, the function should merge these objects recursively. If the values are arrays, the function should concatenate them. If the values are not objects or arrays, the function should use the value from the second object.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, merging `{a: 1, b: {c: 2}}` and `{b: {d: 3}, e: 4}` should result in `{a: 1, b: {c: 2, d: 3}, e: 4}`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating over the keys of both objects and merging them based on their types.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a new object to store the merged result.
  2. Iterate over the keys of the first object and add them to the merged object.
  3. Iterate over the keys of the second object and merge them with the corresponding keys in the merged object.
  4. If both objects have the same key and the values are objects, merge these objects recursively.
  5. If the values are arrays, concatenate them.
  6. If the values are not objects or arrays, use the value from the second object.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it may not be the most efficient solution.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

unordered_map<string, int> deepMerge(unordered_map<string, int> obj1, unordered_map<string, int> obj2) {
    unordered_map<string, int> merged;
    for (auto& pair : obj1) {
        merged[pair.first] = pair.second;
    }
    for (auto& pair : obj2) {
        merged[pair.first] = pair.second;
    }
    return merged;
}

// Note: The above code does not handle nested objects or arrays. 
// For a complete solution, we would need to modify the function to handle these cases.

int main() {
    unordered_map<string, int> obj1 = {{"a", 1}, {"b", 2}};
    unordered_map<string, int> obj2 = {{"b", 3}, {"c", 4}};
    unordered_map<string, int> merged = deepMerge(obj1, obj2);
    for (auto& pair : merged) {
        cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of keys in the two objects.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of keys in the two objects.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are iterating over the keys of both objects once. The space complexity is also linear because we are storing the merged result in a new object.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a recursive function to merge nested objects and arrays.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a new object to store the merged result.
  2. Iterate over the keys of both objects and merge them based on their types.
  3. If both objects have the same key and the values are objects, merge these objects recursively.
  4. If the values are arrays, concatenate them.
  5. If the values are not objects or arrays, use the value from the second object.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only iterates over the keys of both objects once and uses a recursive function to merge nested objects and arrays.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n + m)$, which is the minimum time complexity required to merge two objects.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Define a data structure to represent a value in the object
struct Value {
    int intValue;
    unordered_map<string, Value> objValue;
    vector<Value> arrayValue;
};

// Define a function to merge two objects
Value deepMerge(Value obj1, Value obj2) {
    Value merged;
    // Merge objects
    for (auto& pair : obj1.objValue) {
        if (obj2.objValue.find(pair.first) != obj2.objValue.end()) {
            merged.objValue[pair.first] = deepMerge(pair.second, obj2.objValue[pair.first]);
        } else {
            merged.objValue[pair.first] = pair.second;
        }
    }
    for (auto& pair : obj2.objValue) {
        if (merged.objValue.find(pair.first) == merged.objValue.end()) {
            merged.objValue[pair.first] = pair.second;
        }
    }
    // Merge arrays
    if (!obj1.arrayValue.empty() && !obj2.arrayValue.empty()) {
        merged.arrayValue = obj1.arrayValue;
        merged.arrayValue.insert(merged.arrayValue.end(), obj2.arrayValue.begin(), obj2.arrayValue.end());
    } else if (!obj1.arrayValue.empty()) {
        merged.arrayValue = obj1.arrayValue;
    } else if (!obj2.arrayValue.empty()) {
        merged.arrayValue = obj2.arrayValue;
    }
    // Merge integers
    merged.intValue = obj2.intValue;
    return merged;
}

int main() {
    // Create two objects
    Value obj1;
    obj1.objValue["a"].intValue = 1;
    obj1.objValue["b"].intValue = 2;
    Value obj2;
    obj2.objValue["b"].intValue = 3;
    obj2.objValue["c"].intValue = 4;
    // Merge the objects
    Value merged = deepMerge(obj1, obj2);
    // Print the merged object
    for (auto& pair : merged.objValue) {
        cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second.intValue << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Recursive functions, object merging, array concatenation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Iterating over keys, merging objects and arrays, using recursive functions.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using recursive functions to merge nested objects and arrays.
- Similar problems to practice: Merging multiple objects, merging objects with different data types.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling nested objects and arrays correctly, not using recursive functions to merge objects.
- Edge cases to watch for: Objects with different data types, arrays with different lengths.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms, not optimizing the solution for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different inputs, testing the solution with edge cases.
