## Count Operations to Obtain Zero

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-operations-to-obtain-zero/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes two integers `num1` and `num2` as input and requires finding the minimum number of operations to reduce both numbers to zero.
- Expected output format: The function should return the minimum number of operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The numbers can be reduced by either subtracting the smaller number from the larger one or by dividing the larger number by the smaller one if it is divisible.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if `num1 = 2` and `num2 = 3`, the minimum number of operations is 3 (first subtract 2 from 3 to get 1, then subtract 1 from 2 to get 1, and finally subtract 1 from 1 to get 0).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to use a recursive or iterative method to try all possible operations (subtraction or division) and keep track of the minimum number of operations required to reach zero.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start with the initial numbers `num1` and `num2`.
  2. At each step, check if either number is zero. If both are zero, return the current number of operations.
  3. Otherwise, check if the larger number is divisible by the smaller one. If it is, divide the larger number by the smaller one and increment the operation count.
  4. If the larger number is not divisible by the smaller one, subtract the smaller number from the larger one and increment the operation count.
  5. Repeat steps 2-4 until both numbers are zero.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countOperations(int num1, int num2) {
        int operations = 0;
        while (num1 > 0 && num2 > 0) {
            if (num1 > num2) {
                if (num1 % num2 == 0) {
                    operations += num1 / num2;
                    num1 = 0;
                } else {
                    operations += num1 / num2;
                    num1 %= num2;
                }
            } else {
                if (num2 % num1 == 0) {
                    operations += num2 / num1;
                    num2 = 0;
                } else {
                    operations += num2 / num1;
                    num2 %= num1;
                }
            }
        }
        return operations + num1 + num2;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log \min(num1, num2))$ because in the worst case, we are effectively performing a division at each step, similar to the number of steps in a Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store the input numbers and the operation count.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the division operation at each step, which reduces the size of the numbers exponentially. The space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

The provided brute force approach is actually the optimal solution for this problem. It directly implements the required operations (subtraction or division) in a straightforward manner, ensuring the minimum number of operations to reduce both numbers to zero.

However, for clarity and to follow the guidelines precisely, the explanation of the optimal approach is essentially the same as the brute force approach in this context, as it already represents the most efficient way to solve the problem given the constraints.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countOperations(int num1, int num2) {
        int operations = 0;
        while (num1 > 0 && num2 > 0) {
            if (num1 > num2) {
                if (num1 % num2 == 0) {
                    operations += num1 / num2;
                    num1 = 0;
                } else {
                    operations += num1 / num2;
                    num1 %= num2;
                }
            } else {
                if (num2 % num1 == 0) {
                    operations += num2 / num1;
                    num2 = 0;
                } else {
                    operations += num2 / num1;
                    num2 %= num1;
                }
            }
        }
        return operations + num1 + num2;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log \min(num1, num2))$ as explained before.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as explained before.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it always chooses the operation (division or subtraction) that maximally reduces the larger number, thereby minimizing the total number of operations required to reach zero.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem illustrates the use of division and modulus operations to efficiently reduce numbers.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The solution involves a simple iterative approach to minimize operations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Choosing the operation that maximally reduces the larger number at each step is key to minimizing the total number of operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving minimizing operations to achieve a certain state, such as reducing a set of numbers to a common target.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to check for divisibility before performing division or not handling the case where one number becomes zero correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: When one or both input numbers are zero, the function should return 0 since no operations are needed.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a recursive approach without proper optimization can lead to stack overflow errors for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various inputs, including edge cases like zero, negative numbers (if applicable), and large numbers to verify the function's correctness and performance.
