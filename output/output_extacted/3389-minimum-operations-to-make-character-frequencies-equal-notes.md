## Minimum Operations to Make Character Frequencies Equal

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-character-frequencies-equal/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` containing lowercase English letters.
- Constraints: The length of `s` is in the range `[1, 2 * 10^5]`.
- Expected Output: The minimum number of operations required to make the frequency of each character in the string equal.
- Key Requirements: Find the minimum operations to balance character frequencies.
- Edge Cases: Empty string, string with a single character, string with all characters having the same frequency.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `s = "aabbbcc"`
  Output: `3`
  Explanation: We can make the frequency of each character equal by performing the following operations: 
  - Remove one 'b' and one 'c' to get "aabbcc", then remove one 'a' and one 'c' to get "abbc", and finally remove one 'b' to get "abc".
- Input: `s = "aaaabbbbcccc"`
  Output: `6`
  Explanation: We can make the frequency of each character equal by removing 2 'a's, 2 'b's, and 2 'c's.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves trying all possible combinations of character removals to achieve balanced frequencies.
- This approach involves iterating through the string, counting the frequency of each character, and then trying all possible removal combinations to find the minimum operations required.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minOperations(string s) {
    map<char, int> freq;
    for (char c : s) {
        freq[c]++;
    }
    
    int minFreq = INT_MAX;
    for (auto& pair : freq) {
        minFreq = min(minFreq, pair.second);
    }
    
    int operations = 0;
    for (auto& pair : freq) {
        operations += pair.second - minFreq;
    }
    
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the length of the string and $m$ is the number of unique characters in the string. The reason is that we iterate through the string to count the frequency of each character and then iterate through the frequency map to find the minimum frequency and calculate the operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the number of unique characters in the string. The reason is that we use a map to store the frequency of each character.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we need to iterate through the string and the frequency map to solve the problem.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal solution involves counting the frequency of each character and then finding the minimum frequency. The minimum number of operations required is the sum of the differences between each character's frequency and the minimum frequency.
- This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum operations required without trying all possible combinations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minOperations(string s) {
    map<char, int> freq;
    for (char c : s) {
        freq[c]++;
    }
    
    int minFreq = INT_MAX;
    for (auto& pair : freq) {
        minFreq = min(minFreq, pair.second);
    }
    
    int operations = 0;
    for (auto& pair : freq) {
        operations += pair.second - minFreq;
    }
    
    return operations;
}
```
