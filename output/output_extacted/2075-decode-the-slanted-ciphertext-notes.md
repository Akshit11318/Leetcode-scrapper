## Decode the Slanted Ciphertext
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-the-slanted-ciphertext/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves decoding a given `ciphertext` string into a decoded string. The `ciphertext` is encoded by rearranging the characters in a `rows x cols` matrix in a slanted manner.
- Expected output format: The decoded string.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The encoded string must be decoded back into the original string by reversing the slanted encoding process.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For example, given the input `ciphertext = "ch   ie f L Z Y"` and `rows = 3`, `cols = 5`, the decoded string would be `"chieLfZY"`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves manually iterating over each character in the encoded string and trying to place it in the correct position in the decoded string.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Create an empty decoded string.
    2. Iterate over each character in the encoded string.
    3. For each character, try to find its correct position in the decoded string by simulating the encoding process.
    4. Once the correct position is found, place the character in that position in the decoded string.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and involves directly reversing the encoding process.

```cpp
string decodeCiphertext(string ciphertext, int rows) {
    int cols = ciphertext.size() / rows;
    string decoded;
    for (int diagonal = 0; diagonal < rows + cols - 1; diagonal++) {
        int row = max(0, diagonal - cols + 1);
        int col = min(diagonal, cols - 1);
        while (row < rows && col >= 0) {
            decoded += ciphertext[row * cols + col];
            row++;
            col--;
        }
    }
    return decoded;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$ where $m$ and $n$ are the number of rows and columns respectively, since we are iterating over each character in the encoded string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$ for storing the decoded string.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the iteration over each character in the encoded string, and the space complexity is due to the storage of the decoded string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves directly calculating the position of each character in the decoded string without trying all possible positions.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Calculate the number of columns in the encoded matrix.
    2. Iterate over each diagonal in the encoded matrix.
    3. For each diagonal, iterate over each character in the diagonal and place it in the correct position in the decoded string.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the position of each character in the decoded string without trying all possible positions.

```cpp
string decodeCiphertext(string ciphertext, int rows) {
    int cols = ciphertext.size() / rows;
    string decoded;
    for (int diagonal = 0; diagonal < rows + cols - 1; diagonal++) {
        int row = max(0, diagonal - cols + 1);
        int col = min(diagonal, cols - 1);
        while (row < rows && col >= 0) {
            decoded += ciphertext[row * cols + col];
            row++;
            col--;
        }
    }
    return decoded;
}
```
