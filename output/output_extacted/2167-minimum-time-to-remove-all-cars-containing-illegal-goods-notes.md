## Minimum Time to Remove All Cars Containing Illegal Goods
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-remove-all-cars-containing-illegal-goods/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`, representing a car with or without illegal goods, respectively.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of minutes required to remove all cars containing illegal goods.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Cars can only be removed from the right end of the queue. Removing a car takes one minute.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If `s = "10"`, the minimum time is `2`, as we first remove the car with illegal goods, then the car without.
  - If `s = "0010"`, the minimum time is `4`, as we have to remove all cars until we reach the end.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of removing cars from the right end.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Start from the right end of the string.
  2. If the current car contains illegal goods, remove it and increment the time counter.
  3. If the current car does not contain illegal goods, consider two options:
    - Remove the current car and all cars to its right, then move to the next car.
    - Do not remove the current car and move to the next car.
  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all cars have been processed.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive search approach that guarantees finding the minimum time by considering all possibilities.

```cpp
int minimumTime(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int minTime = INT_MAX;

    // Generate all possible subsets of the string
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        int time = 0;
        string temp = s;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) && temp[i] == '1') {
                time++;
                temp.erase(temp.begin() + i);
            }
        }

        minTime = min(minTime, time);
    }

    return minTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we generate $2^n$ subsets and process each character in the string for each subset.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the temporary string and the mask.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible subsets of the input string, which results in exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the storage required for the temporary string and the mask.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum time required to remove all cars containing illegal goods up to each position.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `n + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum time required to remove all cars containing illegal goods up to the `i-th` position.
  2. Iterate through the string from left to right. For each position `i`, consider two options:
    - If the current car contains illegal goods, remove it and increment the time counter.
    - If the current car does not contain illegal goods, do not remove it and move to the next car.
  3. Update the `dp` table accordingly.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible scenarios and uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.

```cpp
int minimumTime(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int dp[n + 1];
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (s[i - 1] == '1');
    }

    int minTime = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        minTime = min(minTime, dp[i] + n - i);
    }

    return minTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through the string once to fill the `dp` table and once to find the minimum time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the `dp` table.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it considers all possible scenarios and uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations, resulting in a linear time complexity.
