## Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-or-at-least-k-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find the length of the shortest (contiguous) subarray whose sum is at least `k`. If no such subarray exists, return -1.
- Expected output format: The length of the shortest subarray with sum at least `k`, or -1 if no such subarray exists.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The subarray must be contiguous, and the sum must be at least `k`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `nums = [1], k = 1`, Output: `1`, Explanation: The shortest subarray is `[1]`.
  - Input: `nums = [1,2], k = 4`, Output: `-1`, Explanation: No subarray has a sum of at least `k`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible subarrays and check their sums.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subarrays.
  2. For each subarray, calculate its sum.
  3. Check if the sum is at least `k`.
  4. Keep track of the shortest subarray that meets the condition.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive approach that guarantees finding the shortest subarray if one exists.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int res = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int l = i; l <= j; l++) {
                    sum += nums[l];
                }
                if (sum >= k) {
                    res = min(res, j - i + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return res == INT_MAX ? -1 : res;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. This is because we have three nested loops: two for generating subarrays and one for calculating the sum of each subarray.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input and output, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the result and temporary sums.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inherently expensive because it checks every possible subarray, leading to cubic time complexity. The space complexity is low because we don't need to store all subarrays or their sums, just the current sum and the minimum length found so far.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a deque to store the indices of the elements in the subarray. Maintain a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the prefix sum of the array `nums`.
  2. Initialize a deque to store indices of elements that could be the start of the shortest subarray.
  3. Iterate through the array, and for each element, calculate the sum of the subarray ending at the current index.
  4. Use the deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray whose sum is at least `k`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the array and uses a deque to keep track of potential start indices of the shortest subarray, reducing the time complexity significantly.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + nums[i];
        }
        int res = INT_MAX;
        deque<int> dq;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            while (!dq.empty() && prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[dq.front()] >= k) {
                res = min(res, i - dq.front());
                dq.pop_front();
            }
            while (!dq.empty() && prefixSum[i] <= prefixSum[dq.back()]) {
                dq.pop_back();
            }
            dq.push_back(i);
        }
        return res == INT_MAX ? -1 : res;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. This is because we make a single pass through the array to calculate the prefix sum and another pass to find the shortest subarray.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, the deque could store indices for every element in the array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it achieves linear time complexity by using a prefix sum array and a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray whose sum is at least `k`, minimizing the number of operations required.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Prefix sum arrays and the use of a deque for efficient subarray sum calculations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The importance of preprocessing data (calculating prefix sums) and using appropriate data structures (deque) for efficient solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing time complexity by avoiding unnecessary calculations and using data structures that allow for efficient insertion and removal of elements.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving subarray sums, such as finding the maximum sum of a subarray.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating prefix sums or not properly handling edge cases (e.g., empty arrays or `k` being larger than the sum of all elements).
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling arrays with negative numbers, zero, or very large numbers, and ensuring the solution works correctly for these cases.
- Performance pitfalls: Failing to optimize the solution, leading to high time complexity (e.g., using a brute force approach).
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness and efficiency.
