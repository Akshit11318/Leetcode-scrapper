## Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-cutting-cake-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an array of integers `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`, where `horizontalCuts` represents the positions of horizontal cuts and `verticalCuts` represents the positions of vertical cuts. The cake is a square with side length `L = 10^6`. The goal is to find the minimum cost to cut the cake into pieces.
- Expected output format: The minimum cost to cut the cake into pieces.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input arrays are sorted, and the cake must be cut into at least one piece.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `horizontalCuts = [1,2,4]`, `verticalCuts = [3,4,5]`. The minimum cost is `9`.
  - Example 2: `horizontalCuts = [3,4]`, `verticalCuts = [3]`. The minimum cost is `6`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of horizontal and vertical cuts to find the minimum cost.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over all possible horizontal cuts.
  2. For each horizontal cut, iterate over all possible vertical cuts.
  3. Calculate the cost of each combination of cuts.
  4. Update the minimum cost if a smaller cost is found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach, but it is inefficient due to its high time complexity.

```cpp
int minCost(vector<int>& horizontalCuts, vector<int>& verticalCuts) {
    int L = 1000000000;
    int minCost = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < horizontalCuts.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < verticalCuts.size(); j++) {
            int cost = (horizontalCuts[i] - (i > 0 ? horizontalCuts[i-1] : 0)) * 
                       (verticalCuts[j] - (j > 0 ? verticalCuts[j-1] : 0));
            minCost = min(minCost, cost);
        }
    }
    return minCost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of cuts. This is because we have two nested loops iterating over the cuts.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum cost.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high due to the nested loops, and the space complexity is low because we only need to store a single variable.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves finding the maximum distance between two consecutive cuts in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Find the maximum distance between two consecutive horizontal cuts.
  2. Find the maximum distance between two consecutive vertical cuts.
  3. Calculate the minimum cost as the product of the maximum distances.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible combinations of cuts and finds the minimum cost.

```cpp
int minCost(vector<int>& horizontalCuts, vector<int>& verticalCuts) {
    sort(horizontalCuts.begin(), horizontalCuts.end());
    sort(verticalCuts.begin(), verticalCuts.end());
    int maxH = max(horizontalCuts[0], 1000000000 - horizontalCuts.back());
    int maxV = max(verticalCuts[0], 1000000000 - verticalCuts.back());
    for (int i = 1; i < horizontalCuts.size(); i++) {
        maxH = max(maxH, horizontalCuts[i] - horizontalCuts[i-1]);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i < verticalCuts.size(); i++) {
        maxV = max(maxV, verticalCuts[i] - verticalCuts[i-1]);
    }
    return (int)((long long)maxH * maxV % 1000000007);
}
```

> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of cuts. This is because we sort the cuts and then iterate over them.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum distances.
