## Crawler Log Folder
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an array of strings `logs` where each string is a log folder. The logs are in the format of a sequence of operations, each operation being either a file name or a directory name. The constraints are that the input array is not empty and each log is not empty.
- Expected output format: The output should be the minimum number of operations required to traverse all the logs.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The key requirement is to find the minimum number of operations. The edge cases are when the logs are empty, or when there are no operations in the logs.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]`
    Output: `2`
    Explanation: The minimum number of operations required to traverse all the logs is 2.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The initial thought process is to iterate through each log and count the number of operations.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a stack to keep track of the directories.
  2. Iterate through each log.
  3. If the log is a directory, push it to the stack.
  4. If the log is a file, pop the stack until a directory is found.
  5. If the log is "../", pop the stack.
  6. If the log is "./", do nothing.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach comes to mind first because it is a straightforward way to iterate through each log and count the number of operations.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<string>& logs) {
    int operations = 0;
    stack<string> st;
    for (string log : logs) {
        if (log == "../") {
            if (!st.empty()) {
                st.pop();
            }
        } else if (log == "./") {
            continue;
        } else {
            st.push(log);
        }
    }
    return st.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the number of logs and $m$ is the maximum length of a log.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of logs.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are iterating through each log and using a stack to keep track of the directories.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a stack to keep track of the directories and only increment the operations when a new directory is pushed to the stack.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a stack to keep track of the directories.
  2. Iterate through each log.
  3. If the log is a directory, push it to the stack and increment the operations.
  4. If the log is "../", pop the stack if it is not empty.
  5. If the log is "./", do nothing.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only increments the operations when a new directory is pushed to the stack, which is the minimum number of operations required to traverse all the logs.

```cpp
int minOperations(vector<string>& logs) {
    int operations = 0;
    stack<string> st;
    for (string log : logs) {
        if (log == "../") {
            if (!st.empty()) {
                st.pop();
            }
        } else if (log == "./") {
            continue;
        } else {
            st.push(log);
            operations++;
        }
    }
    return operations;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of logs.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only increments the operations when a new directory is pushed to the stack, which is the minimum number of operations required to traverse all the logs.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The key algorithmic concepts demonstrated are the use of a stack to keep track of the directories and the iteration through each log to count the number of operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem-solving pattern identified is the use of a stack to solve problems that involve traversing directories.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimization technique learned is to only increment the operations when a new directory is pushed to the stack.
- Similar problems to practice: Similar problems to practice are problems that involve traversing directories and counting the number of operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: A common implementation error is to not check if the stack is empty before popping it.
- Edge cases to watch for: Edge cases to watch for are when the logs are empty or when there are no operations in the logs.
- Performance pitfalls: A performance pitfall is to not use a stack to keep track of the directories, which can lead to a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.
- Testing considerations: Testing considerations are to test the function with different inputs, including empty logs and logs with no operations.
