## Course Schedule IV
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iv/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `n` courses, `dependencies` as pairs of courses, and `queries` as pairs of courses.
- Constraints: `2 <= n <= 10^5`, `0 <= dependencies.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`.
- Expected output: A boolean array where the `i-th` element is `true` if there's a path from `queries[i][0]` to `queries[i][1]`, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements: Find if there's a path between each query pair of courses considering the dependencies.
- Example test cases:
  - `n = 2`, `dependencies = [[1,0]]`, `queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]`. Output: `[false,true]`.
  - `n = 2`, `dependencies = [[1,0]]`, `queries = [[0,1]]`. Output: `[false]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking each query pair to see if there's a path between them by traversing through the dependencies.
- This can be achieved by performing a Depth-First Search (DFS) for each query pair.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward to understand and implement, especially for those familiar with graph traversal algorithms.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<bool> checkIfPrerequisite(int n, vector<vector<int>>& dependencies, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    for (auto& dep : dependencies) {
        graph[dep[0]].push_back(dep[1]);
    }
    
    vector<bool> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        if (dfs(graph, query[0], query[1], visited)) {
            result.push_back(true);
        } else {
            result.push_back(false);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

bool dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int source, int target, vector<bool>& visited) {
    if (source == target) return true;
    visited[source] = true;
    for (int neighbor : graph[source]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor] && dfs(graph, neighbor, target, visited)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(q \cdot n + m)$ where $q$ is the number of queries, $n$ is the number of nodes (courses), and $m$ is the number of edges (dependencies). This is because for each query, we potentially visit all nodes and edges in the worst case.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ for storing the graph and $O(n)$ for the recursion stack and visited array, simplifying to $O(n + m)$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves potentially checking all dependencies for each query, leading to high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The optimal solution involves building the graph and then using a transitive closure algorithm to efficiently determine reachability between all pairs of nodes.
- We can use Floyd-Warshall algorithm for this purpose, which computes the transitive closure of the graph.
- Why this is optimal: It reduces the time complexity significantly by computing the reachability matrix once, allowing for constant time query resolution.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<bool> checkIfPrerequisite(int n, vector<vector<int>>& dependencies, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<vector<bool>> reach(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) reach[i][i] = true;
    
    for (auto& dep : dependencies) {
        reach[dep[0]][dep[1]] = true;
    }
    
    // Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute transitive closure
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                reach[i][j] = reach[i][j] || (reach[i][k] && reach[k][j]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    vector<bool> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        result.push_back(reach[query[0]][query[1]]);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3 + q)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the number of queries. The $n^3$ term comes from the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and $q$ is for resolving the queries.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ for the reachability matrix.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because it reduces the query time to $O(1)$ after a one-time computation of the transitive closure, which is a significant improvement over the brute force approach.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Graph traversal (DFS), transitive closure (Floyd-Warshall algorithm).
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a brute force approach as a starting point and then optimizing it.
- Optimization techniques learned: Applying Floyd-Warshall algorithm for efficient reachability queries.
- Similar problems to practice: Other graph problems involving reachability and transitive closure.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling cycles in the graph, incorrect initialization of the reachability matrix.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty graph, graph with a single node, queries with non-existent nodes.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach for all queries, not optimizing the algorithm for the given constraints.
- Testing considerations: Test with different graph sizes, densities, and query sets to ensure the solution is robust.
