## Total Characters in String After Transformations II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/total-characters-in-string-after-transformations-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` consisting of lowercase letters and a 2D array `operations` where each operation is a string of two characters representing a transformation (e.g., "ab" means replace "a" with "b").
- Constraints: $1 \leq s.length \leq 100$, $1 \leq operations.length \leq 100$, and each operation is a string of length 2.
- Expected Output: The total number of characters in the string after all transformations have been applied.
- Key Requirements: Apply each transformation in sequence to the string, and count the total number of characters in the final string.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves applying each transformation to the string one by one, checking each character in the string against the source character of the transformation and replacing it with the target character if a match is found.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly implements the given operations without requiring any additional insight into the structure of the problem.

```cpp
int totalCharacters(string s, vector<string>& operations) {
    string str = s;
    for (const auto& op : operations) {
        string temp;
        for (char c : str) {
            if (c == op[0]) {
                temp += op[1];
            } else {
                temp += c;
            }
        }
        str = temp;
    }
    return str.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the string, $m$ is the number of operations, and $k$ is the average number of characters that need to be checked for each operation. This complexity arises because for each operation, we potentially scan the entire string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we create a new string for each operation. The space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input string.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves iterating over the string for each operation, leading to the time complexity. The space complexity is due to the creation of a new string for each transformation.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- A key insight into this problem is recognizing that each transformation can be applied to the string in a single pass, without needing to create a new string for each operation. However, the optimal approach still requires iterating over the string for each operation because the transformations can change the string's content.
- The optimal solution involves directly applying each transformation to the string without creating intermediate strings, which reduces the constant factors in the time complexity but does not change the overall time complexity.

```cpp
int totalCharacters(string s, vector<string>& operations) {
    for (const auto& op : operations) {
        string str = "";
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == op[0]) {
                str += op[1];
            } else {
                str += c;
            }
        }
        s = str;
    }
    return s.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the string and $m$ is the number of operations. This is because we iterate over the string once for each operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we create a new string for each operation. The space complexity remains linear with respect to the size of the input string.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to apply the transformations. It directly implements the given operations without unnecessary overhead.
