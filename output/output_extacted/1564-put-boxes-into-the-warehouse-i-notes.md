## Put Boxes into the Warehouse I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/put-boxes-into-the-warehouse-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `boxes` (list of integers representing box widths) and `warehouse` (list of integers representing warehouse width at each point)
- Constraints: Boxes must be placed from left to right in the warehouse. No box can be placed outside the warehouse or overlap with another box.
- Expected Output: Maximum number of boxes that can be placed in the warehouse.
- Key Requirements: Ensure boxes are placed within the warehouse boundaries without overlapping.
- Edge Cases: Empty warehouse, no boxes, boxes larger than the warehouse.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try placing each box at every possible position in the warehouse and check for validity.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate over each box.
  2. For each box, iterate over each possible position in the warehouse.
  3. Check if the box can be placed at the current position without overlapping with other boxes or exceeding the warehouse width.
  4. If a box can be placed, mark the space it occupies and continue with the next box.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive method to ensure all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
int maxBoxes(vector<int>& boxes, vector<int>& warehouse) {
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << boxes.size()); ++mask) {
        vector<int> currentWarehouse = warehouse;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < boxes.size(); ++i) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                bool placed = false;
                for (int j = 0; j < currentWarehouse.size(); ++j) {
                    if (currentWarehouse[j] >= boxes[i]) {
                        currentWarehouse[j] -= boxes[i];
                        placed = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (placed) {
                    count++;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        maxCount = max(maxCount, count);
    }
    return maxCount;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of boxes and $m$ is the number of points in the warehouse. This is because we generate all subsets of boxes and for each subset, we try to place the boxes in the warehouse.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, for storing the current state of the warehouse.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking all possible combinations of boxes, leading to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to the need to keep track of the warehouse state.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The problem can be viewed as a variant of the `0/1 Knapsack Problem` where each box is an item, and the warehouse width at each point is the capacity of the knapsack. However, the direct application of the knapsack algorithm is not straightforward due to the varying capacities along the warehouse.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Sort the boxes by their widths in descending order.
  2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of boxes that can be placed.
  3. Iterate through the warehouse from left to right. For each point in the warehouse, try to place the largest box that can fit at that point, ensuring it doesn't overlap with previously placed boxes.
- Proof of optimality: By always choosing the largest box that can fit, we maximize the number of boxes placed, as smaller boxes would leave less space for additional boxes.

```cpp
int maxBoxes(vector<int>& boxes, vector<int>& warehouse) {
    sort(boxes.begin(), boxes.end(), greater<int>());
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (int box : boxes) {
        bool placed = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < warehouse.size(); ++i) {
            if (warehouse[i] >= box) {
                warehouse[i] -= box;
                placed = true;
                maxCount++;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!placed) break;
    }
    return maxCount;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of boxes and $m$ is the number of points in the warehouse. The sorting step takes $O(n \log n)$, and the iteration through boxes and warehouse takes $O(n \cdot m)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, if we don't consider the space needed for the input, as we modify the input warehouse in-place.
> - **Optimality proof:** The greedy strategy of always choosing the largest box that can fit ensures that we maximize the number of boxes placed, as it leaves the least amount of space unused for future boxes.
