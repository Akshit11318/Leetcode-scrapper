## Alternating Groups I
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/alternating-groups-i/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/alternating-groups-i/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000`, and `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`.
- Expected output format: The number of alternating groups with size `k` or more.
- Key requirements: Identify groups in `nums` where each element is strictly larger or smaller than the previous one, alternating between these conditions.
- Example test cases: 
  - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3`, Output: `3`
  - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 4`, Output: `2`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate over all possible subarrays of `nums` and check each one to see if it forms an alternating group.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subarrays of `nums`.
  2. For each subarray, check if it is an alternating group by comparing each element with its predecessor.
  3. If a subarray is an alternating group and its size is `k` or more, increment the count.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem by checking every possible subarray, but it's inefficient due to the number of subarrays and the checks involved.

```cpp
int countAlternatingGroups(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            vector<int> subarray(nums.begin() + i, nums.begin() + j + 1);
            if (isAlternatingGroup(subarray) && subarray.size() >= k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

bool isAlternatingGroup(vector<int>& subarray) {
    if (subarray.size() < 2) return true;
    bool isIncreasing = subarray[0] < subarray[1];
    for (int i = 1; i < subarray.size() - 1; i++) {
        if (isIncreasing && !(subarray[i] < subarray[i + 1])) return false;
        if (!isIncreasing && !(subarray[i] > subarray[i + 1])) return false;
        isIncreasing = !isIncreasing;
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`, due to generating all subarrays and checking each for being an alternating group.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the subarrays.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** Generating all subarrays and checking each one leads to high time complexity. Space complexity is due to storing subarrays.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of generating all subarrays, we can iterate through `nums` once and track the length of the current alternating group.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize variables to track the current group's size and whether it's increasing or decreasing.
  2. Iterate through `nums`, updating the group size and direction based on comparisons between consecutive elements.
  3. Whenever the direction changes or we reach the end of `nums`, check if the current group's size is `k` or more and update the count accordingly.
- Proof of optimality: This approach only requires a single pass through `nums`, making it much more efficient than the brute force method.

```cpp
int countAlternatingGroups(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    if (nums.size() < k) return 0;
    int count = 0, currentLength = 1, prevDiff = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1];
        if (diff * prevDiff <= 0 && diff != 0) {
            if (currentLength >= k) count++;
            currentLength = 2;
        } else if (diff != 0) {
            currentLength++;
        }
        prevDiff = diff;
    }
    if (currentLength >= k) count++;
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`, since we only iterate through `nums` once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we only need to make one pass through `nums` to find all alternating groups of size `k` or more, and we cannot do better than linear time for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional checks, and the importance of optimizing the approach to reduce time complexity.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Looking for ways to reduce the number of iterations or comparisons needed to solve a problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary iterations or checks, and using variables efficiently to track relevant information.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving iterating through arrays or strings to find specific patterns or groups.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to handle edge cases, such as an empty input array or `k` being larger than the array length.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `k` is 1 or less, or where the input array has fewer than `k` elements.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures that lead to high time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios.
