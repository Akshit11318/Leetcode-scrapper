## Difference Between Element Sum and Digit Sum of an Array

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/difference-between-element-sum-and-digit-sum-of-an-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an array of integers as input, where each integer is between 1 and 1000. The task is to find the difference between the sum of all elements in the array and the sum of the digits of all elements in the array.
- Expected output format: The output should be an integer representing the difference between the sum of elements and the sum of digits.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input array can be empty, and the integers can range from 1 to 1000. The solution should handle these edge cases correctly.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given the input [1, 15, 6, 3], the sum of elements is 1 + 15 + 6 + 3 = 25, and the sum of digits is 1 + (1 + 5) + 6 + 3 = 1 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 16. Therefore, the difference is 25 - 16 = 9.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves calculating the sum of all elements in the array and then calculating the sum of the digits of all elements in the array. This can be done by iterating over each element in the array, summing up the elements, and then iterating over each digit of each element to sum up the digits.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize two variables, `elementSum` and `digitSum`, to zero.
  2. Iterate over each element in the input array.
  3. For each element, add the element to `elementSum`.
  4. Convert the element to a string to easily iterate over its digits.
  5. For each digit in the string representation of the element, convert the digit back to an integer and add it to `digitSum`.
  6. After iterating over all elements, calculate the difference between `elementSum` and `digitSum`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement by calculating the required sums.

```cpp
int differenceOfSum(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    int elementSum = 0;
    int digitSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        elementSum += nums[i];
        string str = to_string(nums[i]);
        for (char c : str) {
            digitSum += c - '0';
        }
    }
    return elementSum - digitSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array and $m$ is the average number of digits in each element. This is because for each element, we are iterating over its digits.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not including the space required for the input array, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the sums.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the nested iteration over elements and their digits, while the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the sums, regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is similar to the brute force approach but with minor optimizations. However, since the brute force approach already has a linear time complexity with respect to the total number of digits in all numbers, the optimal approach remains essentially the same. The key insight here is recognizing that we must iterate over all elements and their digits at least once to calculate the required sums, making the brute force approach already optimal in terms of time complexity.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The approach remains the same as the brute force approach, with the understanding that it is already optimal due to the necessity of examining each element and digit once.
- Proof of optimality: The optimality of this approach is proven by the fact that we cannot calculate the sum of elements and the sum of their digits without examining each element and digit at least once. This necessitates a time complexity of at least $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of elements and $m$ is the average number of digits per element.

```cpp
int differenceOfSum(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    int elementSum = 0;
    int digitSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        elementSum += nums[i];
        string str = to_string(nums[i]);
        for (char c : str) {
            digitSum += c - '0';
        }
    }
    return elementSum - digitSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of elements and $m$ is the average number of digits per element.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the input array, as we use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the minimum time complexity required to solve the problem because we must examine each element and digit at least once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, string manipulation, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The need to examine each element and digit at least once to calculate sums.
- Optimization techniques learned: Recognizing when a brute force approach is already optimal due to the inherent requirements of the problem.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving iteration over arrays or strings and performing calculations based on the elements or characters.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating the sum of digits by not converting characters back to integers, or failing to handle edge cases like empty arrays.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty arrays, arrays with a single element, and arrays with elements having a large number of digits.
- Performance pitfalls: Assuming a more complex solution is needed when the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
