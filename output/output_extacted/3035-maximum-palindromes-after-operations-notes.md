## Maximum Palindromes After Operations
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-palindromes-after-operations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem provides a string `s` and an integer `k`, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters, and `k` represents the number of operations allowed. The goal is to find the maximum number of palindromes that can be formed after at most `k` operations.
- Expected output format: The function should return the maximum number of palindromes that can be formed.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The function should handle cases where `s` is empty, `k` is zero, or `s` already consists of palindromes.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `s = "abc", k = 2`, the maximum number of palindromes that can be formed is 2, by changing `a` to `c` and then `b` to `c`, resulting in `"ccc"`.
  - Example 2: `s = "aab", k = 1`, the maximum number of palindromes that can be formed is 2, by changing `b` to `a`, resulting in `"aaa"`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible combinations of operations and checking if the resulting string is a palindrome.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of `k` operations on the string `s`.
  2. For each combination, apply the operations to the string `s`.
  3. Check if the resulting string is a palindrome.
  4. If it is a palindrome, increment the count of palindromes.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it is not efficient for large inputs.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool isPalindrome(const std::string& s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.size() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] != s[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

int maximumPalindromes(const std::string& s, int k) {
    int maxPalindromes = 0;
    // Generate all possible combinations of k operations
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << s.size()); i++) {
        if (__builtin_popcount(i) > k) {
            continue;
        }
        std::string temp = s;
        // Apply the operations to the string s
        for (int j = 0; j < s.size(); j++) {
            if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                temp[j] = 'a'; // Replace with a fixed character
            }
        }
        // Check if the resulting string is a palindrome
        if (isPalindrome(temp)) {
            maxPalindromes++;
        }
    }
    return maxPalindromes;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we generate all possible combinations of `k` operations and check if the resulting string is a palindrome.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. This is because we need to store the temporary string `temp`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity due to the generation of all possible combinations of operations and the checking of each resulting string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all possible combinations of operations, we can use a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum number of palindromes that can be formed.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (k+1)`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of palindromes that can be formed using the first `i` characters and `j` operations.
  2. Fill the `dp` array in a bottom-up manner, using the following recurrence relation: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + (s[i-1] == s[i-2]))`.
  3. The final answer is stored in `dp[n][k]`.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of operations and find the maximum number of palindromes that can be formed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int maximumPalindromes(const std::string& s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
            if (j == 0) {
                dp[i][j] = (i % 2 == 0 && s[i - 1] == s[i - 2]) ? dp[i - 2][j] + 1 : dp[i - 1][j];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 2][j - 1] + (s[i - 1] == s[i - 2]));
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][k];
}
```
