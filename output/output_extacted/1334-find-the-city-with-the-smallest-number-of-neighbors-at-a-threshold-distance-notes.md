## Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer `n`, an integer `edges` representing the edges in the graph, and an integer `threshold`.
- Constraints: `2 <= n <= 100`, `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`, `edges[i].length == 2`, `0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < n`, `0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < n`, `0 <= threshold <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: The city with the smallest number of neighbors at a threshold distance.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The graph may not be fully connected, and there may be multiple cities with the same smallest number of neighbors.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `n = 4`, `edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]]`, `threshold = 4`. The output is `3`.
  - `n = 5`, `edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]]`, `threshold = 2`. The output is `0`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can use a brute force approach to calculate the shortest distance between each pair of cities using a `for` loop to iterate through all the edges.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create an adjacency list representation of the graph.
  2. Use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of cities.
  3. For each pair of cities, use another loop to iterate through all the edges to find the shortest path.
  4. If the shortest distance is less than or equal to the threshold, increment the count of neighbors for the current city.
  5. Keep track of the city with the smallest number of neighbors.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it has a high time complexity due to the nested loops.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int findTheCity(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int threshold) {
    vector<vector<int>> dist(n, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dist[i][i] = 0;
    }
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        dist[edge[0]][edge[1]] = edge[2];
        dist[edge[1]][edge[0]] = edge[2];
    }
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (dist[i][k] != INT_MAX && dist[k][j] != INT_MAX) {
                    dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    int minNeighbors = INT_MAX;
    int result = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int neighbors = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i != j && dist[i][j] <= threshold) {
                neighbors++;
            }
        }
        if (neighbors < minNeighbors) {
            minNeighbors = neighbors;
            result = i;
        } else if (neighbors == minNeighbors) {
            result = min(result, i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3 + n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of cities. The first term comes from the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and the second term comes from the loop to find the city with the smallest number of neighbors.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of cities. This is because we need to store the distance matrix.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high due to the nested loops in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and the loop to find the city with the smallest number of neighbors. The space complexity is due to the need to store the distance matrix.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between each pair of cities, such as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create an adjacency list representation of the graph.
  2. Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between each pair of cities.
  3. Use a loop to iterate through all pairs of cities and count the number of neighbors for each city.
  4. Keep track of the city with the smallest number of neighbors.
- Proof of optimality: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$, which is optimal for this problem because we need to calculate the shortest distance between each pair of cities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int findTheCity(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int threshold) {
    vector<vector<int>> dist(n, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dist[i][i] = 0;
    }
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        dist[edge[0]][edge[1]] = edge[2];
        dist[edge[1]][edge[0]] = edge[2];
    }
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (dist[i][k] != INT_MAX && dist[k][j] != INT_MAX) {
                    dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    int minNeighbors = INT_MAX;
    int result = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int neighbors = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i != j && dist[i][j] <= threshold) {
                neighbors++;
            }
        }
        if (neighbors < minNeighbors) {
            minNeighbors = neighbors;
            result = i;
        } else if (neighbors == minNeighbors) {
            result = min(result, i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
