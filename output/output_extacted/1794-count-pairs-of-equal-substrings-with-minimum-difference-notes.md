## Count Pairs of Equal Substrings with Minimum Difference

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-equal-substrings-with-minimum-difference/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two strings `s` and `t`, and an integer `maxDistance`.
- Output: Count the number of pairs of equal substrings with minimum difference between `s` and `t`.
- Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= t.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= maxDistance <= 10^5`.
- Expected output: The number of pairs of equal substrings with minimum difference.

**Key Requirements and Edge Cases:**
- Handle cases where `maxDistance` is greater than the length of either string.
- Consider substrings of all possible lengths up to `maxDistance`.
- Ensure the comparison of substrings is case-sensitive.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `s = "abc", t = "bcd", maxDistance = 1`: There is one pair of equal substrings with minimum difference ("bc" in `s` and "bc" in `t`).
- `s = "abcd", t = "bcde", maxDistance = 2`: There are two pairs of equal substrings with minimum difference ("bc" in `s` and "bc" in `t`, and "cd" in `s` and "cd" in `t`).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to compare every possible substring of `s` with every possible substring of `t`.
- We iterate through all substrings of `s` and `t` and compare them if their lengths are equal and the difference in their starting indices is within `maxDistance`.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement without considering optimizations.

```cpp
int countSubstrings(string s, string t) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int len = 1; len <= min(s.length(), t.length()); len++) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - len; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= t.length() - len; j++) {
                if (s.substr(i, len) == t.substr(j, len)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the minimum length of `s` and `t`, because we have three nested loops iterating over substrings.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input strings, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and loop variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is cubic due to the three nested loops, and the space complexity is constant because we do not allocate any additional data structures that scale with input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a sliding window approach to compare substrings of `s` and `t` efficiently.
- We iterate through all possible lengths of substrings and use two pointers to slide through `s` and `t`, comparing substrings of the same length.
- This approach is optimal because it reduces the number of comparisons needed by avoiding redundant iterations.

```cpp
int countSubstrings(string s, string t) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int len = 1; len <= min(s.length(), t.length()); len++) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - len; i++) {
            for (int j = max(0, i - maxDistance); j <= min((int)t.length() - len, i + maxDistance); j++) {
                if (s.substr(i, len) == t.substr(j, len)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot maxDistance)$, where $n$ is the minimum length of `s` and `t`, because we have three nested loops but the innermost loop's range is limited by `maxDistance`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input strings, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and loop variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the best possible complexity because we must compare each substring of `s` with each substring of `t` that could potentially match, and the sliding window approach minimizes the number of comparisons needed.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: sliding window technique, substring comparison.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: reducing the number of comparisons by limiting the range of the innermost loop.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a sliding window to avoid redundant iterations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not handling edge cases where `maxDistance` exceeds the length of either string.
- Edge cases to watch for: ensuring the comparison of substrings is case-sensitive.
- Performance pitfalls: not optimizing the comparison of substrings to reduce the number of iterations.
- Testing considerations: testing with various input lengths and `maxDistance` values to ensure correctness.
