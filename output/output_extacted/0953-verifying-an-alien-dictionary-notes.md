## Verifying an Alien Dictionary
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input consists of a list of strings `words` and a string `order` representing the alien dictionary's order. The task is to determine if the given list of words is sorted according to the provided alien dictionary order.
- Expected output format: A boolean value indicating whether the list of words is sorted according to the alien dictionary order.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The alien dictionary contains 26 lowercase letters, and the input list of words may be empty or contain duplicate words.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `words = ["hello","leetcode"]`, `order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"` should return `true`.
  - Example 2: `words = ["word","world","row"]`, `order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyxz"` should return `false`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Compare each pair of adjacent words in the list to determine if they are in the correct order according to the alien dictionary.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a mapping of characters to their indices in the alien dictionary order.
  2. Iterate through each pair of adjacent words in the list.
  3. For each pair, compare the characters at the same position in both words.
  4. If the characters are different, check their order in the alien dictionary.
  5. If the order is incorrect, return `false`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive solution that checks each pair of adjacent words.

```cpp
bool isAlienSorted(vector<string>& words, string order) {
    unordered_map<char, int> orderMap;
    for (int i = 0; i < order.size(); i++) {
        orderMap[order[i]] = i;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size() - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < words[i].size(); j++) {
            if (j >= words[i + 1].size()) return false;
            if (words[i][j] != words[i + 1][j]) {
                if (orderMap[words[i][j]] > orderMap[words[i + 1][j]]) {
                    return false;
                }
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of words and $m$ is the maximum length of a word. This is because we are comparing each pair of adjacent words, and each comparison takes $O(m)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a fixed-size mapping to store the alien dictionary order.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the nested loops used to compare each pair of adjacent words, while the space complexity is constant because we are using a fixed-size mapping.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the same approach as the brute force solution, but with a slight optimization.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a mapping of characters to their indices in the alien dictionary order.
  2. Iterate through each pair of adjacent words in the list.
  3. For each pair, compare the characters at the same position in both words.
  4. If the characters are different, check their order in the alien dictionary.
  5. If the order is incorrect, return `false`.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it has the same time complexity as the brute force solution, but with a slight optimization.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We must compare each pair of adjacent words to determine if they are in the correct order, so we cannot improve the time complexity further.

```cpp
bool isAlienSorted(vector<string>& words, string order) {
    vector<int> orderMap(26);
    for (int i = 0; i < order.size(); i++) {
        orderMap[order[i] - 'a'] = i;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size() - 1; i++) {
        string word1 = words[i];
        string word2 = words[i + 1];
        int j = 0;
        while (j < word1.size() && j < word2.size() && word1[j] == word2[j]) {
            j++;
        }
        if (j == word1.size()) continue;
        if (j == word2.size()) return false;
        if (orderMap[word1[j] - 'a'] > orderMap[word2[j] - 'a']) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: String comparison, dictionary mapping.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Comparing adjacent elements in a list.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a fixed-size mapping to store the alien dictionary order.
- Similar problems to practice: Other string comparison problems, such as determining if two strings are anagrams.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty list of words.
- Edge cases to watch for: Duplicate words, words with different lengths.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a slow algorithm, such as a recursive solution.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different input cases, such as an empty list of words or a list with duplicate words.
