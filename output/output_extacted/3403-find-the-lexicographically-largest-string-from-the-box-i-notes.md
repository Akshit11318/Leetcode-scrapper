## Find the Lexicographically Largest String from the Box I
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-lexicographically-largest-string-from-the-box-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given a list of strings `strings` and a string `target`.
- Constraints: `1 <= strings.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= strings[i].length <= 10^5`, `1 <= target.length <= 10^5`, and `strings[i]` and `target` consist of lowercase English letters.
- Expected output format: Return the lexicographically largest string from `strings` that can be formed by appending some characters to `target`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: If no such string exists, return `target`.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For `strings = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]` and `target = "ac"`, the output should be `"acecar"` because it is the lexicographically largest string that can be formed by appending some characters to `"ac"`.
    - For `strings = ["ab","abc","dca","abf","bca","ac"]` and `target = "ab"`, the output should be `"abc"`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through each string in the `strings` list and check if it starts with the `target` string.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store strings that start with the `target`.
    2. Iterate through each string in the `strings` list.
    3. For each string, check if it starts with the `target` string using the `startswith()` function.
    4. If a string starts with the `target`, append it to the list of strings that start with the `target`.
    5. After iterating through all strings, find the lexicographically largest string in the list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and involves checking each string in the list against the `target` string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findLargestString(vector<string>& strings, string target) {
        vector<string> startsWithTarget;
        for (const auto& str : strings) {
            if (str.find(target) == 0) {
                startsWithTarget.push_back(str);
            }
        }
        if (startsWithTarget.empty()) {
            return target;
        }
        string maxStr = startsWithTarget[0];
        for (const auto& str : startsWithTarget) {
            if (str > maxStr) {
                maxStr = str;
            }
        }
        return maxStr;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n*m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings and $m$ is the average length of a string, because we are iterating through each string and checking if it starts with the `target` string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we are storing strings that start with the `target` in a separate list.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are performing a linear search through the list of strings and checking each string against the `target` string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the same approach as the brute force solution, but with a slight optimization. Instead of storing all strings that start with the `target` and then finding the maximum, we can keep track of the maximum string as we iterate through the list.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Initialize an empty string to store the maximum string that starts with the `target`.
    2. Iterate through each string in the `strings` list.
    3. For each string, check if it starts with the `target` string using the `find()` function.
    4. If a string starts with the `target` and is lexicographically larger than the current maximum string, update the maximum string.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we are still checking each string against the `target` string, but we are avoiding the extra step of storing all strings that start with the `target` and then finding the maximum.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findLargestString(vector<string>& strings, string target) {
        string maxStr = "";
        for (const auto& str : strings) {
            if (str.find(target) == 0 && (maxStr.empty() || str > maxStr)) {
                maxStr = str;
            }
        }
        return maxStr.empty() ? target : maxStr;
    }
};
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are only storing the maximum string that starts with the `target`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are avoiding the extra step of storing all strings that start with the `target` and then finding the maximum, which reduces the space complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Linear search, string comparison.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking each string against the `target` string and keeping track of the maximum string.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding extra steps and reducing space complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the lexicographically smallest string, finding the longest common prefix.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking if a string starts with the `target` string correctly, not updating the maximum string correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty `strings` list, empty `target` string.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms or data structures.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different input sizes and edge cases.
