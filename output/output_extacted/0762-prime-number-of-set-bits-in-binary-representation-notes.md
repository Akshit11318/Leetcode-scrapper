## Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation
**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-number-of-set-bits-in-binary-representation/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-number-of-set-bits-in-binary-representation/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- The problem requires finding the number of integers in the range `[left, right]` (inclusive) that have a prime number of `1` bits in their binary representation.
- Input: `left` and `right` integers.
- Output: The count of numbers in the range `[left, right]` that have a prime number of set bits.
- Key requirements: Understanding of binary representation, prime numbers, and iteration through a range.
- Edge cases: Handling the boundary values of `left` and `right`, and considering the definition of prime numbers.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `left = 6, right = 10` returns `4` because `6 (110), 7 (111), 9 (1001),` and `10 (1010)` have prime numbers of set bits (2, 3, 2, and 2 respectively).
- `left = 10, right = 15` returns `4` because `10 (1010), 11 (1011), 12 (1100),` and `13 (1101)` have prime numbers of set bits (2, 3, 2, and 3 respectively).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves understanding the binary representation of numbers and identifying prime numbers.
- To solve this, iterate through each number in the range `[left, right]`, convert it to binary, count the number of `1` bits, and check if this count is a prime number.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement without requiring additional insights.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPrimeSetBits(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
            int setBits = __builtin_popcount(i); // Count set bits
            if (isPrime(setBits)) count++; // Check if the count is prime
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    bool isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return false;
        if (n <= 3) return true;
        if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;
        for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
            if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \sqrt{m})$ where $n$ is the range of numbers (`right - left + 1`) and $m$ is the maximum possible number of set bits in the binary representation of `right`. This is because for each number, we are counting set bits (which is $O(\log m)$) and checking if the count is prime (which is $O(\sqrt{m})$ in the worst case for the `isPrime` function).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the count and other variables, regardless of the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the iteration over the range and the prime checking, while the space complexity remains constant as we only use a fixed amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight here is recognizing that the possible number of set bits for any integer is limited (up to the number of bits in the binary representation of the maximum possible integer value, which is 32 for a 32-bit integer).
- Since the number of set bits can only range from 1 to 32 (for 32-bit integers), and we are only interested in prime counts, we can pre-compute which of these counts are prime.
- This approach optimizes the problem by avoiding the need to check for primality for each number in the range, reducing the complexity significantly.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPrimeSetBits(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        vector<bool> prime(33, false); // Assume 32-bit integer
        prime[2] = prime[3] = prime[5] = prime[7] = prime[11] = prime[13] = prime[17] = prime[19] = prime[23] = prime[29] = prime[31] = true;
        
        for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
            int setBits = __builtin_popcount(i);
            if (prime[setBits]) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the range of numbers (`right - left + 1`), as we are simply iterating over the range and checking if the count of set bits is in our pre-computed list of primes.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a fixed amount of space to store the pre-computed prime numbers and other variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we have reduced the time complexity to linear with respect to the input range, and the space complexity remains constant. Further optimization is not possible without changing the problem constraints.
