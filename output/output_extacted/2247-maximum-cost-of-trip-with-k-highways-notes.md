## Maximum Cost of Trip with K Highways

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-cost-of-trip-with-k-highways/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A 2D vector `highways` representing the highways, where each highway is represented as a 3-element vector `[u, v, cost]`, and two integers `k` and `start`.
- Constraints: The number of highways is between 1 and 10^5, and the number of nodes in the graph is between 1 and 10^5.
- Expected Output: The maximum cost of a trip that can be achieved by using at most `k` highways.
- Key Requirements: The trip must start at the node `start` and can only use each highway at most once.
- Edge Cases: The graph may not be connected, and there may be multiple highways between the same pair of nodes.

Example test cases:
- `highways = [[0, 1, 10], [1, 2, 20], [0, 2, 30]]`, `k = 1`, `start = 0`. The maximum cost is 30.
- `highways = [[0, 1, 10], [1, 2, 20], [0, 2, 30]]`, `k = 2`, `start = 0`. The maximum cost is 50.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of highways and calculate the cost of each combination.
- Step-by-step breakdown: 
  1. Generate all possible combinations of highways.
  2. For each combination, calculate the cost by summing the costs of the highways in the combination.
  3. Keep track of the maximum cost seen so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible solutions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxCost(vector<vector<int>>& highways, int k, int start) {
    int n = 0;
    for (auto& highway : highways) {
        n = max(n, max(highway[0], highway[1]));
    }
    n++;

    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n);
    for (auto& highway : highways) {
        graph[highway[0]].emplace_back(highway[1], highway[2]);
    }

    vector<int> maxCosts(n, 0);
    maxCosts[start] = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
        vector<int> newMaxCosts = maxCosts;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (auto& neighbor : graph[j]) {
                newMaxCosts[neighbor.first] = max(newMaxCosts[neighbor.first], maxCosts[j] + neighbor.second);
            }
        }
        maxCosts = newMaxCosts;
    }

    return *max_element(maxCosts.begin(), maxCosts.end());
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of highways. This is because we are iterating over all nodes and highways for each iteration of the outer loop.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of highways. This is because we are storing the graph and the maximum costs.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating over all nodes and highways for each iteration of the outer loop. The space complexity occurs because we are storing the graph and the maximum costs.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the maximum cost path.
- Detailed breakdown: 
  1. Create a graph where each node is a pair of the node and the number of highways used to reach it.
  2. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the maximum cost path from the start node to all other nodes.
- Proof of optimality: Dijkstra's algorithm is guaranteed to find the maximum cost path.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int node;
    int highways;
    int cost;
};

struct Compare {
    bool operator()(const Node& a, const Node& b) {
        return a.cost < b.cost;
    }
};

int maxCost(vector<vector<int>>& highways, int k, int start) {
    int n = 0;
    for (auto& highway : highways) {
        n = max(n, max(highway[0], highway[1]));
    }
    n++;

    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n);
    for (auto& highway : highways) {
        graph[highway[0]].emplace_back(highway[1], highway[2]);
    }

    vector<vector<int>> maxCosts(n, vector<int>(k + 1, numeric_limits<int>::min()));
    maxCosts[start][0] = 0;

    priority_queue<Node, vector<Node>, Compare> pq;
    pq.push({start, 0, 0});

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        Node node = pq.top();
        pq.pop();

        for (auto& neighbor : graph[node.node]) {
            if (node.highways < k) {
                int newCost = node.cost + neighbor.second;
                if (newCost > maxCosts[neighbor.first][node.highways + 1]) {
                    maxCosts[neighbor.first][node.highways + 1] = newCost;
                    pq.push({neighbor.first, node.highways + 1, newCost});
                }
            }
        }
    }

    int maxCost = numeric_limits<int>::min();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
            maxCost = max(maxCost, maxCosts[i][j]);
        }
    }

    return maxCost;
}
```
