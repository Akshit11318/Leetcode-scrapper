## Count the Number of Square-Free Subsets

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-square-free-subsets/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an array of integers `nums` where each element is in the range `[1, 30]`.
- A square-free subset is a subset where no square number is a factor of any element in the subset.
- Return the number of square-free subsets of the given array.
- Input format: An array of integers `nums`.
- Expected output format: The number of square-free subsets.
- Key requirements: Counting subsets without square factors.
- Edge cases: Empty array, array with a single element, array with all square numbers.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `nums = [3,4,4,5]`
  Output: `3`
  Explanation: The square-free subsets are `[3]`, `[5]`, and `[3,5]`.
- Input: `nums = [1]`
  Output: `1`
  Explanation: The only square-free subset is `[1]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves generating all possible subsets of the given array.
- Then, for each subset, check if any of its elements have a square factor.
- If a subset has no elements with square factors, it is a square-free subset.
- Count all such subsets to get the final answer.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement without considering optimizations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int squareFreeSubsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            bool isSquareFree = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    for (int j = 2; j * j <= nums[i]; j++) {
                        if (nums[i] % (j * j) == 0) {
                            isSquareFree = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
                if (!isSquareFree) break;
            }
            if (isSquareFree) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot m \cdot \sqrt{m})$, where $n$ is the size of the input array and $m$ is the maximum value in the array. This is because for each subset (which is $2^n$), we potentially check each element (which is $m$) and for each element, we check up to its square root (which is $\sqrt{m}$).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input, because we only use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high due to generating all subsets and checking each element for square factors. The space complexity is low because we don't use any data structures that scale with input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach involves using dynamic programming to count the square-free subsets.
- First, identify the square numbers up to 30, which are 4, 9, 16, 25.
- Then, for each number in the input array, check if it has any of these square numbers as factors.
- Use a bitmask to represent which square numbers are factors of the current subset.
- Iterate through the array, and for each number, update the bitmask and count the square-free subsets.
- This approach is optimal because it avoids redundant calculations by using dynamic programming.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int squareFreeSubsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> squares = {4, 9, 16, 25};
        unordered_map<int, int> dp;
        dp[0] = 1; // Empty subset is always square-free
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            bool isSquareFree = true;
            for (int square : squares) {
                if (num % square == 0) {
                    isSquareFree = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isSquareFree) {
                unordered_map<int, int> newDp;
                for (auto& [mask, count] : dp) {
                    newDp[mask] += count;
                    newDp[mask | (1 << (num - 1))] += count;
                }
                dp = newDp;
            } else {
                unordered_map<int, int> newDp;
                for (auto& [mask, count] : dp) {
                    newDp[mask] += count;
                }
                dp = newDp;
            }
        }
        int total = 0;
        for (auto& [mask, count] : dp) {
            total += count;
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot 2^m)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array and $m$ is the number of distinct elements in the array. This is because we iterate through the array and for each element, we potentially update the bitmask.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^m)$, where $m$ is the number of distinct elements in the array, because we use a hashmap to store the bitmask and its corresponding count.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and only considers the relevant square numbers as factors.
