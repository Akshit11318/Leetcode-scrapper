## The Number of Users That Are Eligible for Discount

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-users-that-are-eligible-for-discount/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a table `Users` with columns `user_id` and `last_active_date`, find the number of users who are eligible for a discount. A user is eligible if their last active date is within 30 days of the current date.
- Expected output format: A single integer value representing the number of eligible users.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The last active date is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
  - The current date is the date when the query is run.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If the current date is '2024-03-16', a user with a last active date of '2024-02-15' is not eligible for the discount, but a user with a last active date of '2024-02-16' is eligible.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to iterate over each user in the `Users` table and calculate the difference between the current date and their last active date. If the difference is less than or equal to 30 days, increment the count of eligible users.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Get the current date.
  2. Iterate over each user in the `Users` table.
  3. For each user, calculate the difference between the current date and their last active date.
  4. If the difference is less than or equal to 30 days, increment the count of eligible users.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward, intuitive solution that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <ctime>
#include <sstream>

struct User {
    int user_id;
    std::string last_active_date;
};

int getEligibleUsers(const std::vector<User>& users, const std::string& currentDate) {
    int eligibleCount = 0;
    for (const auto& user : users) {
        // Convert dates to time_t for comparison
        std::tm lastActiveTm = {};
        std::tm currentTm = {};
        std::istringstream lastActiveSs(user.last_active_date);
        std::istringstream currentSs(currentDate);
        lastActiveSs >> std::get_time(&lastActiveTm, "%Y-%m-%d");
        currentSs >> std::get_time(&currentTm, "%Y-%m-%d");
        std::time_t lastActiveTime = std::mktime(&lastActiveTm);
        std::time_t currentTime = std::mktime(&currentTm);
        
        // Calculate the difference in days
        double diff = difftime(currentTime, lastActiveTime) / (60 * 60 * 24);
        
        if (diff <= 30) {
            eligibleCount++;
        }
    }
    return eligibleCount;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<User> users = {
        {1, "2024-02-16"},
        {2, "2024-01-15"},
        {3, "2024-03-01"}
    };
    std::string currentDate = "2024-03-16";
    std::cout << "Number of eligible users: " << getEligibleUsers(users, currentDate) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of users. This is because we are iterating over each user once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input and output. This is because we are using a constant amount of space to store the count of eligible users and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because of the iteration over each user, and the space complexity is low because we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using SQL to directly query the database for users whose last active date is within 30 days of the current date. This approach eliminates the need to manually iterate over each user and calculate the date difference.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use SQL to query the `Users` table.
  2. In the query, use the `DATE` function to get the current date and calculate the date 30 days ago.
  3. Use the `WHERE` clause to filter users whose last active date is within the last 30 days.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly queries the database for the required information without the need for manual iteration or date calculations. This results in a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to the brute force approach.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(user_id)
FROM Users
WHERE last_active_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Users` table that need to be scanned. However, this is typically much faster than the brute force approach because databases are optimized for querying.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the query results. This is because the database query does not require additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it leverages the database's query capabilities to directly retrieve the required information, minimizing computational overhead.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, date calculations, and database querying.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct calculation vs. leveraging database query capabilities.
