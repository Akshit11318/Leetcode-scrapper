## Find Beautiful Indices in the Given Array II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-beautiful-indices-in-the-given-array-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of integers `nums` where each element is between `1` and `10^5`, and an integer `k`.
- Expected output format: Return a list of indices `i` such that `nums[i - k]` is defined and `nums[i - k] < nums[i]`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle edge cases where `i - k` is less than `0`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `[3, 4]` because `nums[0] < nums[3]` and `nums[1] < nums[4]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through each index in the array and check if the corresponding index `i - k` exists and if `nums[i - k] < nums[i]`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each index `i` in the array `nums`.
  2. For each index, check if `i - k` is greater than or equal to `0`.
  3. If `i - k` is valid, compare `nums[i - k]` and `nums[i]`.
  4. If `nums[i - k] < nums[i]`, add `i` to the result list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by checking each index against the condition specified.

```cpp
vector<int> beautifulArrayII(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (i - k >= 0 && nums[i - k] < nums[i]) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`, because we iterate through the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might store every index in the result list.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a constant amount of work for each element in the input array. The space complexity is also linear because we store the indices that meet the condition in a separate list.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal in terms of time complexity because we must examine each element at least once to determine if it meets the condition.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same approach as the brute force is used because it is already optimal.
- Proof of optimality: Any algorithm must at least read the input, which takes $O(n)$ time. Therefore, the brute force approach is optimal.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must check each element against the condition specified, which requires at least $O(n)$ time.

```cpp
vector<int> beautifulArrayII(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (i - k >= 0 && nums[i - k] < nums[i]) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
