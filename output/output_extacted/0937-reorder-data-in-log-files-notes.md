## Reorder Data in Log Files
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-data-in-log-files/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of strings representing log files, where each log file is a string of the form `"id message"` or `"id number"`.
- Constraints: The input array will contain at least one log file and at most 5000 log files. Each log file will contain at least one character and at most 100 characters.
- Expected output format: An array of strings representing the reordered log files.
- Key requirements: Log files with letters after the identifier should come before log files with numbers after the identifier. Log files with the same type (letter or number) should be ordered based on their identifiers and then their content.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]`
  - Output: `["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]`

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Sort the log files based on their types (letter or number) and then their content.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Separate the log files into two lists: one for letter logs and one for number logs.
  2. Sort the letter logs based on their content and then their identifiers.
  3. Sort the number logs based on their identifiers.
  4. Combine the sorted letter logs and number logs.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward to separate the logs based on their types and then sort them based on their content and identifiers.

```cpp
vector<string> reorderLogFiles(vector<string>& logs) {
    vector<string> letterLogs;
    vector<string> numberLogs;
    
    for (auto log : logs) {
        if (isalpha(log.back())) {
            letterLogs.push_back(log);
        } else {
            numberLogs.push_back(log);
        }
    }
    
    sort(letterLogs.begin(), letterLogs.end(), [](const string& a, const string& b) {
        string aContent = a.substr(a.find(' ') + 1);
        string bContent = b.substr(b.find(' ') + 1);
        if (aContent == bContent) {
            return a.substr(0, a.find(' ')) < b.substr(0, b.find(' '));
        }
        return aContent < bContent;
    });
    
    vector<string> result;
    result.insert(result.end(), letterLogs.begin(), letterLogs.end());
    result.insert(result.end(), numberLogs.begin(), numberLogs.end());
    
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of logs. This is because we are sorting the letter logs.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of logs. This is because we are storing the letter logs and number logs in separate vectors.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation, and the space complexity is due to the extra vectors used to store the letter logs and number logs.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The same as the brute force approach, but we can use a custom comparator to simplify the sorting process.
- Detailed breakdown: Use a custom comparator to sort the logs based on their types and content.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has the same time complexity as the brute force approach, but it is more concise and easier to understand.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation, and we cannot improve the time complexity of the sorting algorithm.

```cpp
vector<string> reorderLogFiles(vector<string>& logs) {
    vector<string> letterLogs;
    vector<string> numberLogs;
    
    for (auto log : logs) {
        if (isalpha(log.back())) {
            letterLogs.push_back(log);
        } else {
            numberLogs.push_back(log);
        }
    }
    
    sort(letterLogs.begin(), letterLogs.end(), [](const string& a, const string& b) {
        string aContent = a.substr(a.find(' ') + 1);
        string bContent = b.substr(b.find(' ') + 1);
        if (aContent == bContent) {
            return a.substr(0, a.find(' ')) < b.substr(0, b.find(' '));
        }
        return aContent < bContent;
    });
    
    vector<string> result;
    result.insert(result.end(), letterLogs.begin(), letterLogs.end());
    result.insert(result.end(), numberLogs.begin(), numberLogs.end());
    
    return result;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, custom comparators, and string manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Separating data into different categories and sorting them based on specific criteria.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using custom comparators to simplify sorting operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve sorting and string manipulation, such as [Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/).

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as empty strings or invalid input.
- Edge cases to watch for: Log files with empty content or identifiers, and log files with numbers and letters mixed together.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient sorting algorithms or data structures.
- Testing considerations: Test the solution with different types of input, including edge cases and large datasets.
