## Minimize Maximum Value in a Grid

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-value-in-a-grid/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D grid of integers `grid` with dimensions `m x n`.
- Constraints: The grid contains only non-negative integers.
- Expected output format: The minimum possible maximum value in the grid after modifying the grid.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The grid can be modified by increasing the value of any cell by 1, and the goal is to minimize the maximum value in the grid.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given the grid `[[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`, the minimum possible maximum value is 2, which can be achieved by increasing the value of the first column by 1.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible modifications to the grid and calculating the maximum value for each modification.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the minimum maximum value.
  2. Iterate over all possible modifications to the grid (i.e., increasing the value of each cell by 1).
  3. For each modification, calculate the maximum value in the grid.
  4. Update the minimum maximum value if the current maximum value is smaller.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and involves trying all possible solutions.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minimizeMaxValueInGrid(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int minMaxValue = INT_MAX;

    // Try all possible modifications to the grid
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // Increase the value of the current cell by 1
            grid[i][j]++;

            // Calculate the maximum value in the grid
            int maxValue = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < m; k++) {
                for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
                    maxValue = std::max(maxValue, grid[k][l]);
                }
            }

            // Update the minimum maximum value
            minMaxValue = std::min(minMaxValue, maxValue);

            // Decrease the value of the current cell by 1 to restore the original grid
            grid[i][j]--;
        }
    }

    return minMaxValue;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m^2 \cdot n^2)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the grid. This is because we are trying all possible modifications to the grid, which involves iterating over all cells in the grid for each modification.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, which means the space required does not change with the size of the input grid, because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the minimum maximum value and the maximum value in the grid.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are using nested loops to try all possible modifications to the grid and calculate the maximum value for each modification. The space complexity occurs because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the minimum maximum value and the maximum value in the grid.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves finding the minimum possible maximum value in the grid by using a binary search approach.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the minimum and maximum possible values for the binary search.
  2. Perform a binary search to find the minimum possible maximum value.
  3. For each mid value in the binary search, check if it is possible to achieve a maximum value less than or equal to the mid value by modifying the grid.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a binary search approach to find the minimum possible maximum value, which reduces the time complexity from $O(m^2 \cdot n^2)$ to $O(m \cdot n \cdot \log(maxValue))$, where $maxValue$ is the maximum value in the grid.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

bool isPossible(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid, int maxValue) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();

    // Check if it is possible to achieve a maximum value less than or equal to the mid value
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] > maxValue) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}

int minimizeMaxValueInGrid(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();

    int minValue = 0;
    int maxValue = INT_MAX;

    // Perform a binary search to find the minimum possible maximum value
    while (minValue <= maxValue) {
        int mid = minValue + (maxValue - minValue) / 2;

        if (isPossible(grid, mid)) {
            maxValue = mid - 1;
        } else {
            minValue = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return minValue;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Binary search, modification of the grid to achieve a minimum possible maximum value.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a binary search approach to find the minimum possible maximum value.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity from $O(m^2 \cdot n^2)$ to $O(m \cdot n \cdot \log(maxValue))$ by using a binary search approach.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving modification of the grid to achieve a minimum or maximum value.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking the base cases correctly, not updating the minimum and maximum possible values correctly in the binary search.
- Edge cases to watch for: The grid can be empty, the grid can contain only one cell, the maximum value in the grid can be very large.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach instead of a binary search approach, not optimizing the space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the code with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
