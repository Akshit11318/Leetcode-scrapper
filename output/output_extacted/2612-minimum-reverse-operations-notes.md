## Minimum Reverse Operations
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-reverse-operations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of integers `tasks` where `tasks[i]` represents the `i-th` task, and an integer `k`, find the minimum number of reverse operations required to make all tasks satisfy the condition `tasks[i] <= tasks[i + k]` for `0 <= i < n - k`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of reverse operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input array can be of any size, and `k` can be any integer between `1` and `n - 1`. The tasks array can contain duplicate values.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `tasks = [1, 2, 3], k = 1`, the output should be `0` because the tasks already satisfy the condition.
  - Example 2: `tasks = [3, 2, 1], k = 1`, the output should be `2` because we need to reverse the order of two pairs of tasks to satisfy the condition.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can try all possible combinations of reverse operations and check if the condition is satisfied after each operation.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of reverse operations.
  2. For each combination, apply the reverse operations to the tasks array.
  3. Check if the condition `tasks[i] <= tasks[i + k]` is satisfied for all `0 <= i < n - k`.
  4. If the condition is satisfied, count the number of reverse operations in the current combination.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible solutions and checks if they satisfy the condition.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minReverseOperationsBruteForce(std::vector<int>& tasks, int k) {
    int n = tasks.size();
    int minOperations = n;

    // Generate all possible combinations of reverse operations
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        std::vector<int> currentTasks = tasks;
        int operations = 0;

        // Apply reverse operations
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                // Reverse the task at index i
                std::reverse(currentTasks.begin() + i, currentTasks.begin() + i + k);
                operations++;
            }
        }

        // Check if the condition is satisfied
        bool satisfied = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - k; i++) {
            if (currentTasks[i] > currentTasks[i + k]) {
                satisfied = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        // Update the minimum number of operations
        if (satisfied && operations < minOperations) {
            minOperations = operations;
        }
    }

    return minOperations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of tasks and $k$ is the given integer. This is because we generate all possible combinations of reverse operations and apply each operation to the tasks array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of tasks. This is because we need to store the current tasks array and the mask for generating combinations.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations of reverse operations, which results in an exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we only need to store the current tasks array and the mask.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a greedy approach to find the minimum number of reverse operations. We iterate through the tasks array and check if the current task is greater than the task `k` positions ahead. If it is, we reverse the tasks between the current index and the index `k` positions ahead.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the minimum number of operations to 0.
  2. Iterate through the tasks array from the first task to the $(n - k)$-th task.
  3. For each task, check if it is greater than the task `k` positions ahead.
  4. If it is, reverse the tasks between the current index and the index `k` positions ahead, and increment the minimum number of operations.
- Proof of optimality: The greedy approach ensures that we only reverse the tasks when necessary, which minimizes the number of reverse operations.

```cpp
int minReverseOperationsOptimal(std::vector<int>& tasks, int k) {
    int n = tasks.size();
    int minOperations = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - k; i++) {
        if (tasks[i] > tasks[i + k]) {
            // Reverse the tasks between index i and i + k
            std::reverse(tasks.begin() + i, tasks.begin() + i + k + 1);
            minOperations++;
        }
    }

    return minOperations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of tasks and $k$ is the given integer. This is because we iterate through the tasks array and reverse the tasks between the current index and the index `k` positions ahead when necessary.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the number of tasks. This is because we only need to modify the tasks array in place.
> - **Optimality proof:** The greedy approach ensures that we only reverse the tasks when necessary, which minimizes the number of reverse operations. This is because reversing the tasks between the current index and the index `k` positions ahead when the current task is greater than the task `k` positions ahead ensures that the condition `tasks[i] <= tasks[i + k]` is satisfied for all `0 <= i < n - k`.
