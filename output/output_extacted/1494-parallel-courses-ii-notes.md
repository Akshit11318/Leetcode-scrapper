## Parallel Courses II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/parallel-courses-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an integer `n` representing the number of courses and a 2D array `dependencies` where each dependency is represented as an array of two integers, `[x, y]`, meaning course `x` must be taken after course `y`.
- Expected output format: The function should return the minimum number of semesters required to complete all courses.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The problem involves graph theory and topological sorting. We must handle cases where there are no dependencies, and cases where there are circular dependencies.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For `n = 4` and `dependencies = [[1,3],[3,2],[2,4]]`, the output should be `3` because we can complete the courses in three semesters: first semester take course `3`, second semester take course `1` and `2`, third semester take course `4`.
    - For `n = 5` and `dependencies = [[1,5]]`, the output should be `2` because we can complete the courses in two semesters: first semester take courses `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, second semester take course `5`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach would involve trying all possible combinations of courses for each semester and checking if the dependencies are satisfied.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Generate all possible combinations of courses for each semester.
    2. For each combination, check if the dependencies are satisfied.
    3. If the dependencies are satisfied, calculate the number of semesters required.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward but inefficient because it involves trying all possible combinations, which results in a high time complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int minNumberOfSemesters(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& dependencies) {
    // Generate all possible combinations of courses for each semester
    // Check if the dependencies are satisfied for each combination
    // Calculate the number of semesters required
    // This approach is not efficient and will result in a high time complexity
    // O(2^n) because we are generating all possible combinations of n courses
    return 0; // placeholder for the actual implementation
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$ because we are generating all possible combinations of n courses.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ because we need to store the combinations of courses for each semester.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are trying all possible combinations of courses, which results in a high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a graph to represent the courses and their dependencies. We can then use a topological sorting algorithm to find the minimum number of semesters required to complete all courses.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Build a graph representing the courses and their dependencies.
    2. Use a topological sorting algorithm to find the order in which the courses should be taken.
    3. Calculate the minimum number of semesters required based on the topological sorting.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it finds the minimum number of semesters required to complete all courses by considering the dependencies between the courses.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it considers all the dependencies between the courses and finds the minimum number of semesters required.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int minNumberOfSemesters(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& dependencies) {
    // Build a graph representing the courses and their dependencies
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> graph(n + 1);
    std::vector<int> in_degree(n + 1, 0);
    for (const auto& dependency : dependencies) {
        graph[dependency[1]].push_back(dependency[0]);
        in_degree[dependency[0]]++;
    }

    // Use a topological sorting algorithm to find the order in which the courses should be taken
    std::queue<int> queue;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (in_degree[i] == 0) {
            queue.push(i);
        }
    }

    int semester = 0;
    while (!queue.empty()) {
        int size = queue.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            int course = queue.front();
            queue.pop();
            for (int neighbor : graph[course]) {
                in_degree[neighbor]--;
                if (in_degree[neighbor] == 0) {
                    queue.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        semester++;
    }

    return semester;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ where n is the number of courses and m is the number of dependencies.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ because we need to store the graph and the in-degree of each course.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it finds the minimum number of semesters required to complete all courses by considering the dependencies between the courses.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Topological sorting and graph theory.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a graph to represent the problem and finding the minimum number of semesters required.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a topological sorting algorithm to find the minimum number of semesters required.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve graph theory and topological sorting, such as finding the minimum number of days required to complete all tasks.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not considering the dependencies between the courses, not using a topological sorting algorithm.
- Edge cases to watch for: Cases where there are no dependencies, cases where there are circular dependencies.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient algorithm, such as the brute force approach.
- Testing considerations: Testing the code with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
