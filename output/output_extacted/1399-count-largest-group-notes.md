## Count Largest Group
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-largest-group/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a positive integer `n`, count the number of groups where the sum of the digits of each number in the range `[1, n]` is equal to the maximum sum of digits.
- Expected output format: The number of groups with the maximum sum of digits.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling large inputs, optimizing for performance.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - For `n = 13`, the maximum sum of digits is `4` (from `9`), and the numbers with a sum of `4` are `[4, 13, 9, 3]`. So, the output is `4`.
  - For `n = 2`, the maximum sum of digits is `2` (from `2`), and the only number with a sum of `2` is `[2]`. So, the output is `1`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the sum of digits for each number in the range `[1, n]`, keep track of the maximum sum encountered, and count the occurrences of numbers with this maximum sum.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum sum and the count of numbers with this sum.
  2. Iterate over each number in the range `[1, n]`.
  3. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits.
  4. If the sum of digits is greater than the current maximum sum, update the maximum sum and reset the count.
  5. If the sum of digits equals the current maximum sum, increment the count.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem by checking every possible number, making it a straightforward but potentially inefficient solution.

```cpp
int countLargestGroup(int n) {
    int maxSum = 0, count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int sum = 0, num = i;
        while (num > 0) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        if (sum > maxSum) {
            maxSum = sum;
            count = 1;
        } else if (sum == maxSum) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \log(n))$, where $n$ is the input number. The outer loop runs $n$ times, and the inner while loop runs $\log(n)$ times in the worst case (when $n$ is a number with the maximum possible number of digits).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of space is used.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the nested loop structure, where each number up to $n$ is processed, and for each number, its digits are summed. The space complexity is constant because only a fixed amount of space is needed to store the variables, regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same as the brute force approach, but we can slightly optimize the code by directly calculating the sum of digits and comparing it with the maximum sum found so far.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize variables for the maximum sum and the count of numbers with this sum.
  2. Iterate over each number in the range `[1, n]`.
  3. Calculate the sum of digits for the current number.
  4. Update the maximum sum and count as necessary.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it must check each number at least once to determine if it contributes to the maximum sum of digits. The time complexity remains $O(n \cdot \log(n))$ due to the necessity of processing each number and summing its digits.

```cpp
int countLargestGroup(int n) {
    int maxSum = 0, count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int sum = 0, num = i;
        while (num > 0) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        if (sum > maxSum) {
            maxSum = sum;
            count = 1;
        } else if (sum == maxSum) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \log(n))$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because for each of the $n$ numbers, we calculate the sum of its digits, which takes $\log(n)$ time in the worst case.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of space is used to store the variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it checks each number exactly once and performs a constant amount of work for each number (summing its digits), which is necessary to solve the problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional updates, and the calculation of digit sums.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The need to iterate over a range and update maximum values based on conditions.
- Optimization techniques learned: Direct calculation and comparison to avoid unnecessary steps.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving iteration, conditional updates, and calculations, such as finding the maximum or minimum of a certain property within a range.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly updating the maximum sum or count, or failing to reset the count when a new maximum sum is found.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where `n` is `1`, or where the maximum sum of digits is found early in the iteration.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient methods to calculate the sum of digits, such as converting numbers to strings and then summing character values.
- Testing considerations: Ensuring the function works correctly for small and large inputs, and for inputs where the maximum sum of digits occurs early or late in the range.
