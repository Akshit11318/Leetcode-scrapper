## Fix Product Name Format
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/fix-product-name-format/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A string `name` representing the product name.
- Constraints: The string can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, and possibly other characters.
- Expected output format: The product name in a standardized format, where the first letter of each word is capitalized, and the rest of the letters are in lowercase.
- Key requirements: The solution should handle different cases (e.g., all uppercase, all lowercase, mixed case) and possibly non-alphabetic characters.
- Example test cases:
  - "i love leetcode" -> "I Love Leetcode"
  - "LEETCODE" -> "Leetcode"
  - "a" -> "A"

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves iterating over each character in the string and checking if it's the first character of a word or not. If it is, we capitalize it; otherwise, we make it lowercase.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Split the input string into words based on spaces.
  2. For each word, capitalize the first letter and make the rest lowercase.
  3. Join the formatted words back into a single string.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

std::string fixProduct_name_format(std::string name) {
    std::vector<std::string> words;
    std::string word = "";
    
    // Split the string into words
    for (char c : name) {
        if (c == ' ') {
            words.push_back(word);
            word = "";
        } else {
            word += c;
        }
    }
    words.push_back(word);
    
    // Format each word
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
        words[i][0] = toupper(words[i][0]);
        for (int j = 1; j < words[i].size(); j++) {
            words[i][j] = tolower(words[i][j]);
        }
    }
    
    // Join the words back into a string
    std::string formatted_name = "";
    for (std::string w : words) {
        formatted_name += w + " ";
    }
    // Remove the trailing space
    formatted_name.pop_back();
    
    return formatted_name;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string, because we are scanning the string once to split it into words and then once more to format each word.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because in the worst case, we might end up storing all characters of the input string in the `words` vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are performing a constant amount of work for each character in the input string. The space complexity is also linear because we are storing all the words in a vector.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight here is to use the `istringstream` class to split the string into words more efficiently and then apply the `toupper` and `tolower` functions to each character as we iterate over the words.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Use `istringstream` to split the input string into words.
  2. For each word, capitalize the first letter and make the rest lowercase.
  3. Join the formatted words back into a single string.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

std::string fixProduct_name_format(std::string name) {
    std::istringstream iss(name);
    std::string word, formatted_name;
    
    while (iss >> word) {
        word[0] = toupper(word[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < word.size(); i++) {
            word[i] = tolower(word[i]);
        }
        formatted_name += word + " ";
    }
    // Remove the trailing space
    formatted_name.pop_back();
    
    return formatted_name;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string, because we are scanning the string once to split it into words and format them.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we are storing the formatted string, which in the worst case can be as large as the input string.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to format the string. It only scans the input string once, making it as efficient as possible.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: string manipulation, character casing, and word splitting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using standard library functions like `toupper` and `tolower` to simplify character casing tasks.
- Optimization techniques learned: minimizing the number of iterations over the input data and using efficient data structures like `istringstream` for string splitting.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not handling edge cases like empty strings or strings with only one word.
- Not considering the case where the input string contains non-alphabetic characters.
- Not optimizing the solution for performance, leading to inefficient code.
