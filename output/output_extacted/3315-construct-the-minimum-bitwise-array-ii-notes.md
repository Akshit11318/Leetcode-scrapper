## Construct the Minimum Bitwise Array II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-minimum-bitwise-array-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an integer `n`, construct an array `arr` of length `n` such that `arr[i]` is the minimum possible value that satisfies `i ^ arr[i] >= i`.
- The goal is to minimize the sum of all elements in `arr`.
- Input: `n` (integer, 1 <= n <= 10^5)
- Expected output: `arr` (array of integers, length `n`)
- Key requirements and edge cases:
  - `arr[i]` must be a non-negative integer.
  - The condition `i ^ arr[i] >= i` must be satisfied for all `i`.
- Example test cases:
  - For `n = 3`, one possible solution is `[2, 0, 3]`.
  - For `n = 5`, one possible solution is `[4, 0, 2, 0, 5]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible values for `arr[i]` and check if the condition `i ^ arr[i] >= i` is satisfied.
- We can iterate over all possible values of `arr[i]` from `0` to `i` and check the condition.
- If the condition is satisfied, we update `arr[i]` with the current value.

```cpp
vector<int> constructArray(int n) {
    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            if (i ^ j >= i) {
                arr[i] = j;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return arr;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the input integer. This is because we have a nested loop structure, where the outer loop runs `n` times and the inner loop runs up to `i` times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n` is the input integer. This is because we need to store the `arr` array of length `n`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity due to the nested loop structure, which leads to a quadratic time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we only need to store the `arr` array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to observe that `i ^ arr[i] >= i` implies `arr[i]` must be a subset of the bits of `i`.
- We can start with `arr[i] = 0` and then update it to be the smallest possible value that satisfies the condition.
- If `i` is even, we can set `arr[i] = i / 2`, because `i ^ (i / 2) = 3i / 2 >= i`.
- If `i` is odd, we can set `arr[i] = 0`, because `i ^ 0 = i >= i`.

```cpp
vector<int> constructArray(int n) {
    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            arr[i] = i / 2;
        } else {
            arr[i] = 0;
        }
    }
    return arr;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n` is the input integer. This is because we only have a single loop that runs `n` times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where `n` is the input integer. This is because we need to store the `arr` array of length `n`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are using the smallest possible values for `arr[i]` that satisfy the condition. Any other approach would require more operations or more space.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The key algorithmic concept demonstrated is the use of bitwise operations to solve the problem.
- The problem-solving pattern identified is the use of a greedy approach to find the smallest possible values for `arr[i]`.
- The optimization technique learned is the use of bitwise operations to reduce the time complexity.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- A common implementation error is to use a brute force approach without considering the properties of bitwise operations.
- An edge case to watch for is when `i` is odd, because `arr[i]` must be set to `0` in this case.
- A performance pitfall is to use a nested loop structure, which leads to a high time complexity.
