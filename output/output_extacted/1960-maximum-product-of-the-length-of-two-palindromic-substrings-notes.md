## Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-substrings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s`.
- Output: The maximum product of the lengths of two non-overlapping palindromic substrings.
- Key requirements and edge cases:
  - The input string `s` can be empty or contain up to `10^5` characters.
  - Two substrings are considered non-overlapping if they do not share any characters.
  - If it is impossible to find two non-overlapping palindromic substrings, the function should return `0`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible pair of substrings to see if they are palindromic and non-overlapping.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible substrings of the input string `s`.
  2. For each pair of substrings, check if they are palindromic by comparing characters from the start and end.
  3. If both substrings are palindromic, check if they are non-overlapping by verifying that the end of the first substring is less than the start of the second substring (or vice versa).
  4. If a pair of non-overlapping palindromic substrings is found, calculate the product of their lengths and update the maximum product found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive approach that checks all possibilities, which is often the first instinct when faced with a problem involving combinatorics and string manipulation.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int maxProduct = 0;
        
        // Generate all possible substrings
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                string substr1 = s.substr(i, j - i);
                
                // Check all possible second substrings that do not overlap with the first
                for (int k = j; k < n; k++) {
                    for (int end = k + 1; end <= n; end++) {
                        string substr2 = s.substr(k, end - k);
                        
                        // Check if both substrings are palindromic
                        if (isPalindromic(substr1) && isPalindromic(substr2)) {
                            // Calculate the product of their lengths
                            int product = substr1.length() * substr2.length();
                            maxProduct = max(maxProduct, product);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxProduct;
    }
    
    bool isPalindromic(string str) {
        int left = 0, right = str.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (str[left] != str[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^4)$ because we have four nested loops: two for generating substrings and two for checking non-overlap and palindromic properties.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the substrings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking all possible substrings and their combinations, leading to high time complexity. The space complexity is due to the need to store these substrings.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use dynamic programming to efficiently find all palindromic substrings and then find the maximum product of two non-overlapping palindromic substrings.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `true` if the substring from `i` to `j` is palindromic.
  2. Fill the `dp` table by checking for palindromes of length 1, 2, and then for lengths greater than 2.
  3. Use the `dp` table to find all palindromic substrings and their lengths.
  4. Iterate through all pairs of non-overlapping palindromic substrings and calculate the product of their lengths, updating the maximum product found.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach efficiently uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant checks, making it optimal for finding all palindromic substrings and their products.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        vector<vector<bool>> dp(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
        vector<int> palindromes;
        
        // Fill dp table to find all palindromic substrings
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i][i] = true; // Length 1 is always a palindrome
            palindromes.push_back(1);
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    if (j - i == 1 || dp[i + 1][j - 1]) {
                        dp[i][j] = true;
                        palindromes.push_back(j - i + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int maxProduct = 0;
        // Find the maximum product of two non-overlapping palindromic substrings
        for (int len1 : palindromes) {
            for (int len2 : palindromes) {
                if (len1 + len2 <= n) {
                    maxProduct = max(maxProduct, len1 * len2);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxProduct;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ because filling the `dp` table and finding all palindromic substrings takes quadratic time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ for the `dp` table and $O(n)$ for storing palindromic lengths.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach efficiently finds all palindromic substrings and calculates the maximum product of two non-overlapping ones, making it optimal.
