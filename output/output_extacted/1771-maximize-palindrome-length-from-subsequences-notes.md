## Maximize Palindrome Length From Subsequences

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-palindrome-length-from-subsequences/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two strings `s1` and `s2`.
- Constraints: `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000`.
- Expected output format: The maximum length of a palindrome that can be formed by taking a subsequence from `s1` and a subsequence from `s2`.
- Key requirements: The resulting sequence must be a palindrome, and it must be formed by taking characters from `s1` and `s2` without using any character more times than it appears in its respective string.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `s1 = "cacb", s2 = "cbba"` Output: `5`
  - Input: `s1 = "ab", s2 = "ab"` Output: `3`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves generating all possible subsequences of `s1` and `s2`, then checking each pair to see if it can form a palindrome.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible subsequences of `s1` and `s2`.
  2. For each subsequence of `s1`, pair it with every subsequence of `s2`.
  3. Check if the combined sequence can be rearranged into a palindrome.
  4. Keep track of the longest palindrome found.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(vector<string>& subseqs) {
        int maxLen = 0;
        for (int mask1 = 1; mask1 < (1 << s1.size()); ++mask1) {
            for (int mask2 = 1; mask2 < (1 << s2.size()); ++mask2) {
                string sub1, sub2;
                for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); ++i) {
                    if (mask1 & (1 << i)) sub1 += s1[i];
                }
                for (int i = 0; i < s2.size(); ++i) {
                    if (mask2 & (1 << i)) sub2 += s2[i];
                }
                string combined = sub1 + sub2;
                if (isPalindrome(combined)) {
                    maxLen = max(maxLen, (int)combined.size());
                }
            }
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
    
    bool isPalindrome(string& s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] != s[right]) return false;
            left++, right--;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{n+m} \cdot (n+m))$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, respectively. This is because for each of the $2^n$ subsequences of `s1` and $2^m$ subsequences of `s2`, we generate the subsequence and check if it's a palindrome, which takes $O(n+m)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n+m)$, for storing the subsequences and the combined string.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates all possible subsequences, leading to exponential time complexity, and checks each for being a palindrome, adding a linear factor.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence between `s1` and the reverse of `s2`, which directly contributes to forming a palindrome.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Reverse `s2` to get `rev_s2`.
  2. Use dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between `s1` and `rev_s2`.
  3. The length of the LCS is the maximum length of a palindrome that can be formed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s1, string s2) {
        string rev_s2 = s2;
        reverse(rev_s2.begin(), rev_s2.end());
        
        int n = s1.size(), m = rev_s2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(m + 1, 0));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
                if (s1[i - 1] == rev_s2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][m];
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, respectively. This is because we fill up a 2D table of size $n \times m$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, for the 2D table used in dynamic programming.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly computes the maximum length of a palindrome that can be formed by considering all possible overlaps between `s1` and the reverse of `s2`, which is the most efficient way to form a palindrome from subsequences of two strings.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of identifying the key insight or pattern in a problem.
- Dynamic programming as a powerful tool for solving problems involving sequences and subsequences.
- The concept of reversing a string to find palindromic subsequences.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the reversal of the second string as a step to simplify the problem.
- Overlooking the use of dynamic programming for efficient computation of the longest common subsequence.
- Failing to recognize the relationship between the longest common subsequence and the formation of a palindrome from subsequences of two strings.
