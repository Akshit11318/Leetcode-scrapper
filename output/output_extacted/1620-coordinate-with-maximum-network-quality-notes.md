## Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/coordinate-with-maximum-network-quality/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of `n` coordinates `x` and `y`, and a list of `m` `radius` and `quality` values for each cell tower, find the coordinates with the maximum network quality.
- Expected output format: The maximum network quality and the coordinates where this quality is achieved.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where there are multiple coordinates with the same maximum network quality, and ensuring that the solution scales for large inputs.
- Example test cases with explanations: Test cases should include scenarios with different numbers of cell towers and coordinates, and edge cases like empty input lists.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each coordinate, calculate the network quality by considering all cell towers and summing up the qualities for which the distance between the coordinate and the cell tower is within the tower's radius.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through each coordinate.
  2. For each coordinate, iterate through each cell tower.
  3. Calculate the distance between the current coordinate and the cell tower.
  4. If the distance is within the cell tower's radius, add the cell tower's quality to the current coordinate's network quality.
  5. After checking all cell towers for a coordinate, update the maximum network quality if the current coordinate's quality is higher.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the problem statement by checking each coordinate against all cell towers, making it straightforward but potentially inefficient for large inputs.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct CellTower {
    int x, y, radius, quality;
};

struct Coordinate {
    int x, y, quality = 0;
};

void calculateNetworkQuality(vector<Coordinate>& coordinates, const vector<CellTower>& cellTowers) {
    for (auto& coord : coordinates) {
        for (const auto& tower : cellTowers) {
            int dx = coord.x - tower.x;
            int dy = coord.y - tower.y;
            int distanceSquared = dx * dx + dy * dy;
            if (distanceSquared <= tower.radius * tower.radius) {
                coord.quality += tower.quality;
            }
        }
    }
}

pair<int, vector<Coordinate>> findMaximumNetworkQuality(vector<Coordinate>& coordinates, const vector<CellTower>& cellTowers) {
    calculateNetworkQuality(coordinates, cellTowers);
    int maxQuality = 0;
    vector<Coordinate> maxQualityCoordinates;
    for (const auto& coord : coordinates) {
        if (coord.quality > maxQuality) {
            maxQuality = coord.quality;
            maxQualityCoordinates = {coord};
        } else if (coord.quality == maxQuality) {
            maxQualityCoordinates.push_back(coord);
        }
    }
    return {maxQuality, maxQualityCoordinates};
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of coordinates and $m$ is the number of cell towers. This is because for each coordinate, we check all cell towers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, for storing the coordinates and cell towers.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops through the coordinates and cell towers, leading to the $O(n \cdot m)$ time complexity. The space complexity is linear with respect to the input sizes because we need to store all coordinates and cell towers.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved with the same time complexity as the brute force approach because we must consider each cell tower for each coordinate to accurately calculate network quality. However, optimizations can be made in terms of how we calculate distances and manage data structures.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: Instead of directly calculating the distance for each pair of coordinate and cell tower, we can use the fact that the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. Since we're comparing distances to the radius, we can square both sides of the inequality to avoid the square root calculation, thus slightly improving performance.
- Proof of optimality: This approach remains $O(n \cdot m)$ because we still must check each cell tower for each coordinate. However, by avoiding unnecessary square root calculations, we slightly optimize the constant factor within the time complexity.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Without additional information or constraints (like specific distributions of coordinates or cell towers), we cannot avoid checking each cell tower for each coordinate, making $O(n \cdot m)$ the best achievable time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct CellTower {
    int x, y, radius, quality;
};

struct Coordinate {
    int x, y, quality = 0;
};

void calculateNetworkQualityOptimized(vector<Coordinate>& coordinates, const vector<CellTower>& cellTowers) {
    for (auto& coord : coordinates) {
        for (const auto& tower : cellTowers) {
            int dx = coord.x - tower.x;
            int dy = coord.y - tower.y;
            int distanceSquared = dx * dx + dy * dy;
            if (distanceSquared <= tower.radius * tower.radius) {
                coord.quality += tower.quality;
            }
        }
    }
}

pair<int, vector<Coordinate>> findMaximumNetworkQualityOptimized(vector<Coordinate>& coordinates, const vector<CellTower>& cellTowers) {
    calculateNetworkQualityOptimized(coordinates, cellTowers);
    int maxQuality = 0;
    vector<Coordinate> maxQualityCoordinates;
    for (const auto& coord : coordinates) {
        if (coord.quality > maxQuality) {
            maxQuality = coord.quality;
            maxQualityCoordinates = {coord};
        } else if (coord.quality == maxQuality) {
            maxQualityCoordinates.push_back(coord);
        }
    }
    return {maxQuality, maxQualityCoordinates};
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, as we still must consider each cell tower for each coordinate.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, for storing the coordinates and cell towers, similar to the brute force approach.
> - **Optimality proof:** The slight optimization in avoiding square root calculations improves the constant factor within the time complexity but does not change the overall time complexity, making this the optimal approach given the problem constraints.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional checks, and optimization of calculations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The need to consider all possible combinations (in this case, each coordinate with each cell tower) when calculating network quality.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary calculations (like square roots) to improve performance.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving spatial relationships and quality calculations, such as finding the closest points or distributing resources based on proximity.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating distances or misunderstanding the problem constraints.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling scenarios with no coordinates, no cell towers, or cases where the maximum quality is not unique.
- Performance pitfalls: Failing to optimize calculations where possible, leading to slower performance for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Ensuring to test with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and large datasets, to validate the solution's correctness and performance.
