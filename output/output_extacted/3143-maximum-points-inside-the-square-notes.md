## Maximum Points Inside the Square
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-inside-the-square/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A list of points on a 2D plane, where each point is represented as `[x, y]`, and a square with a side length of `sideLength`.
- Constraints: The points are given as a list of integers, where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]`. The side length of the square is given as an integer `sideLength`.
- Expected Output: The maximum number of points that lie inside or on the boundary of the square.
- Key Requirements: 
    - The square has its bottom-left corner at the origin `(0, 0)`.
    - A point is considered inside the square if its x-coordinate is between `0` and `sideLength`, and its y-coordinate is between `0` and `sideLength`.
    - A point is considered on the boundary of the square if its x-coordinate is either `0` or `sideLength`, or its y-coordinate is either `0` or `sideLength`.
- Example Test Cases:
    - Example 1: `points = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]`, `sideLength = 4`. Output: `4`.
    - Example 2: `points = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]`, `sideLength = 3`. Output: `3`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate over each point and check if it lies inside or on the boundary of the square.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
    1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of points inside the square.
    2. Iterate over each point in the list of points.
    3. For each point, check if its x-coordinate is between `0` and `sideLength` (inclusive), and its y-coordinate is between `0` and `sideLength` (inclusive).
    4. If the point is inside or on the boundary of the square, increment the counter.
    5. Return the counter as the maximum number of points inside the square.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, as it involves a simple iteration over the points and a basic conditional check.

```cpp
int maxPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, int sideLength) {
    int count = 0;
    for (auto& point : points) {
        int x = point[0];
        int y = point[1];
        if (x >= 0 && x <= sideLength && y >= 0 && y <= sideLength) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of points, because we iterate over each point once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the counter.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a constant amount of work for each point, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is that we can use the same approach as the brute force, but with some minor optimizations.
- Detailed breakdown:
    1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of points inside the square.
    2. Iterate over each point in the list of points.
    3. For each point, check if its x-coordinate is between `0` and `sideLength` (inclusive), and its y-coordinate is between `0` and `sideLength` (inclusive).
    4. If the point is inside or on the boundary of the square, increment the counter.
    5. Return the counter as the maximum number of points inside the square.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a linear time complexity, which is optimal because we must at least look at each point once.

```cpp
int maxPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, int sideLength) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& point : points) {
        if (point[0] >= 0 && point[0] <= sideLength && point[1] >= 0 && point[1] <= sideLength) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of points, because we iterate over each point once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the counter.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we must at least look at each point once, and we do so in a single pass.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: iteration, conditional checks.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: checking if a point is inside or on the boundary of a square.
- Optimization techniques learned: none, as the problem is already solved optimally.
- Similar problems to practice: other problems involving geometric shapes and point checks.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: forgetting to check for the boundary conditions (i.e., `x == 0` or `x == sideLength`, and `y == 0` or `y == sideLength`).
- Edge cases to watch for: points with negative coordinates or coordinates greater than `sideLength`.
- Performance pitfalls: using a non-linear data structure or algorithm, which would increase the time complexity.
- Testing considerations: test the function with different inputs, including edge cases and large inputs, to ensure it works correctly and efficiently.
