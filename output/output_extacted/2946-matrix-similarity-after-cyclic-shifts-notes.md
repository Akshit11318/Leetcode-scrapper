## Matrix Similarity After Cyclic Shifts
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-similarity-after-cyclic-shifts/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two `m x n` matrices `mat1` and `mat2`.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if `mat1` and `mat2` are similar after some number of operations, `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Two matrices are considered similar if one can be obtained from the other by applying any sequence of the following operations: 
    1. Row cyclic shift: shifting all elements in a row one position to the right, with the last element moving to the first position.
    2. Column cyclic shift: shifting all elements in a column one position down, with the last element moving to the first position.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - Example 1: `mat1 = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`, `mat2 = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`. Return `true`.
    - Example 2: `mat1 = [[1,2],[2,1]]`, `mat2 = [[1,2],[1,2]]`. Return `false`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to generate all possible matrices by applying the given operations to `mat1` and then checking if any of these generated matrices match `mat2`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Generate all possible row and column cyclic shifts for `mat1`.
    2. For each generated matrix, compare it with `mat2`.
    3. If a match is found, return `true`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement by exhaustively exploring all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool findRotation(vector<vector<int>>& mat1, vector<vector<int>>& mat2) {
        int m = mat1.size();
        int n = mat1[0].size();
        
        // Check for all four rotations
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            // If mat1 is equal to mat2 after rotation, return true
            if (isEqual(mat1, mat2)) return true;
            // Rotate mat1 by 90 degrees clockwise
            rotate(mat1);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        
        // Transpose the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                swap(mat[i][j], mat[j][i]);
            }
        }
        
        // Reverse each row
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            reverse(mat[i].begin(), mat[i].end());
        }
    }
    
    bool isEqual(vector<vector<int>>& mat1, vector<vector<int>>& mat2) {
        int m = mat1.size();
        int n = mat1[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (mat1[i][j] != mat2[i][j]) return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n \cdot 4)$ where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we are checking for four rotations and comparing each rotated matrix with the target matrix.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are modifying the input matrix in-place.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are performing a constant number of operations (rotations and comparisons) for each element in the matrix. The space complexity is constant because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all possible rotations and comparing them with the target matrix, we can directly check if the target matrix is a rotation of the original matrix by comparing their elements after applying rotation transformations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Check if the target matrix is a rotation of the original matrix by 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
    2. For each rotation, compare the elements of the rotated matrix with the target matrix.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly checks for the possible rotations without generating all possible rotations, thus reducing the number of operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool findRotation(vector<vector<int>>& mat1, vector<vector<int>>& mat2) {
        int m = mat1.size();
        int n = mat1[0].size();
        
        // Check for all four rotations
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            // If mat1 is equal to mat2 after rotation, return true
            if (isEqual(mat1, mat2)) return true;
            // Rotate mat1 by 90 degrees clockwise
            rotate(mat1);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        
        // Transpose the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                swap(mat[i][j], mat[j][i]);
            }
        }
        
        // Reverse each row
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            reverse(mat[i].begin(), mat[i].end());
        }
    }
    
    bool isEqual(vector<vector<int>>& mat1, vector<vector<int>>& mat2) {
        int m = mat1.size();
        int n = mat1[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (mat1[i][j] != mat2[i][j]) return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
