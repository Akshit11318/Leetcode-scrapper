## Maximum Number of Integers to Choose from a Range I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-integers-to-choose-from-a-range-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`, and `1 <= k <= 10^9`.
- Expected output format: The maximum number of integers that can be chosen from `nums` such that no two integers are within `k` of each other.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The integers in `nums` are not necessarily sorted, and `k` can be larger than the range of `nums`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]` and `k = 1`, the maximum number of integers that can be chosen is 3 (e.g., `[1,3,5]`).
  - If `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]` and `k = 2`, the maximum number of integers that can be chosen is 2 (e.g., `[1,4]`).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of integers in `nums` and check if they satisfy the condition.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of integers in `nums`.
  2. For each combination, check if any two integers are within `k` of each other.
  3. If a combination satisfies the condition, update the maximum count of integers.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that tries all possible solutions.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxIntegersToChoose(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
        int count = 0;
        bool valid = true;
        std::vector<int> chosen;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                chosen.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < chosen.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < chosen.size(); ++j) {
                if (abs(chosen[i] - chosen[j]) <= k) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!valid) break;
        }
        if (valid) {
            maxCount = std::max(maxCount, (int)chosen.size());
        }
    }
    return maxCount;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. The reason is that we generate all possible combinations of integers in `nums` (which takes $O(2^n)$ time), and for each combination, we check if any two integers are within `k` of each other (which takes $O(n^2)$ time).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. The reason is that we need to store the chosen integers.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach tries all possible combinations of integers in `nums`, which leads to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we only need to store the chosen integers.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a greedy approach to choose the integers. We start by sorting the integers in `nums`. Then, we choose the smallest integer that is not within `k` of any previously chosen integer.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the integers in `nums` in ascending order.
  2. Initialize an empty vector `chosen` to store the chosen integers.
  3. Initialize a variable `lastChosen` to store the last chosen integer.
  4. Iterate over the sorted integers in `nums`. For each integer, check if it is not within `k` of `lastChosen`. If it is not, add it to `chosen` and update `lastChosen`.
- Proof of optimality: The greedy approach is optimal because it always chooses the smallest integer that is not within `k` of any previously chosen integer. This ensures that we maximize the number of integers that can be chosen.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxIntegersToChoose(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int maxCount = 0;
    int lastChosen = -k - 1;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num - lastChosen > k) {
            maxCount++;
            lastChosen = num;
        }
    }
    return maxCount;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. The reason is that we sort the integers in `nums` (which takes $O(n \log n)$ time), and then iterate over the sorted integers (which takes $O(n)$ time).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. The reason is that we need to store the sorted integers.
> - **Optimality proof:** The greedy approach is optimal because it always chooses the smallest integer that is not within `k` of any previously chosen integer. This ensures that we maximize the number of integers that can be chosen.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy approach, sorting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Choosing the smallest integer that is not within `k` of any previously chosen integer.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a greedy approach to reduce the time complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: [Insert similar problems].

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not sorting the integers in `nums` before applying the greedy approach.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `k` is larger than the range of `nums`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach instead of a greedy approach.
- Testing considerations: Test the solution with different inputs, including edge cases.
