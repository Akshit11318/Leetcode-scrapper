## Longest Uploaded Prefix
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uploaded-prefix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: `LCP` array representing the lengths of the longest common prefixes between each pair of consecutive strings in a list of strings.
- Constraints: `1 <= LCP.length <= 1000`, `LCP[i] >= 0`.
- Expected output format: The length of the longest prefix that has been uploaded.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Handling empty input arrays.
  - Dealing with arrays containing a single element.
  - Understanding the meaning of `LCP` values and how they relate to the length of the longest uploaded prefix.

**Example Test Cases:**
- For `LCP = [4,0,4,3,0,5,5,0,0]`, the longest uploaded prefix is of length `4`.
- For `LCP = [4,3,4,3,0,5,5,0,0]`, the longest uploaded prefix is of length `4`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to directly calculate the length of the longest common prefix between each pair of consecutive strings and keep track of the maximum length encountered.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize a variable `max_length` to store the maximum length of the common prefix encountered so far.
  2. Iterate through the `LCP` array, and for each `LCP[i]`, update `max_length` if `LCP[i]` is greater than `max_length`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward and directly addresses the problem by considering each `LCP` value as a potential candidate for the longest uploaded prefix.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPrefix(vector<int>& LCP) {
        int max_length = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < LCP.size(); i++) {
            if (LCP[i] > max_length) {
                max_length = LCP[i];
            }
        }
        return max_length;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the `LCP` array, since we're iterating through the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're using a constant amount of space to store the `max_length` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we're performing a single pass through the input array. The space complexity is constant because we're not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is recognizing that the problem essentially asks for the maximum value in the `LCP` array, as this directly corresponds to the length of the longest uploaded prefix.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Initialize a variable `max_length` to zero.
  2. Iterate through the `LCP` array, updating `max_length` whenever a larger `LCP` value is encountered.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a linear time complexity, which is the best we can achieve for a problem that requires examining each element in the input array at least once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPrefix(vector<int>& LCP) {
        return *max_element(LCP.begin(), LCP.end());
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the `LCP` array, because we're still iterating through the array once to find the maximum value.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're using the `max_element` function which operates in-place.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because we must examine each element at least once to find the maximum. The space complexity is optimal because we're not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Finding the maximum value in an array, understanding the relationship between `LCP` values and the length of the longest uploaded prefix.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Recognizing the need to iterate through the input array to find a maximum or minimum value.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using built-in functions like `max_element` to simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing variables before use, not handling edge cases like an empty input array.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input array, input array with a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary loops or data structures that increase time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various input sizes and edge cases to verify the correctness and performance of the solution.
