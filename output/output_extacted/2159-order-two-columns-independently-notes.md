## Order Two Columns Independently

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/order-two-columns-independently/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D vector of integers `mat` representing the matrix.
- Constraints: `1 <= mat.length <= 4`, `mat[i].length == 2`, `1 <= mat[i][0], mat[i][1] <= 9`.
- Expected output format: The lexicographically smallest matrix after ordering the columns independently.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The matrix can have at most 4 rows.
  - Each row has exactly 2 columns.
  - The numbers in the matrix are single-digit integers.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `mat = [[3,3],[3,3]]`, output should be `[[3,3],[3,3]]`.
  - `mat = [[3,3],[1,1]]`, output should be `[[1,1],[3,3]]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all permutations of the columns and compare them to find the lexicographically smallest one.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of the columns.
  2. For each permutation, create a new matrix with the columns ordered according to the permutation.
  3. Compare the new matrix with the current smallest matrix and update the smallest matrix if necessary.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that involves generating all possible permutations and comparing them.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> orderTwoColumnsIndependently(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& mat) {
        // Generate all permutations of the columns
        std::vector<int> columns = {0, 1};
        std::sort(columns.begin(), columns.end());
        
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> smallestMat = mat;
        
        do {
            std::vector<std::vector<int>> newMat = mat;
            for (int i = 0; i < newMat.size(); i++) {
                std::swap(newMat[i][0], newMat[i][1]);
            }
            std::sort(newMat.begin(), newMat.end());
            if (newMat < smallestMat) {
                smallestMat = newMat;
            }
        } while (std::next_permutation(columns.begin(), columns.end()));
        
        return smallestMat;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \cdot log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the matrix. This is because we generate all permutations of the columns and compare them.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the matrix. This is because we need to store the new matrix and the smallest matrix.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we generate all permutations of the columns, and the space complexity is moderate because we need to store the new matrix and the smallest matrix.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can simply sort the columns independently.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the first column.
  2. Sort the second column.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the matrix.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot log(n))$, which is the best possible time complexity for sorting.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> orderTwoColumnsIndependently(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& mat) {
        // Sort the first column
        std::sort(mat.begin(), mat.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });
        
        // Sort the second column
        std::sort(mat.begin(), mat.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        
        return mat;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the matrix. This is because we sort the columns independently.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the matrix. This is because we sort the columns in place.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot log(n))$, which is the best possible time complexity for sorting.
