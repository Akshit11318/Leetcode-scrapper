## Make String Anti-Palindrome
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/make-string-anti-palindrome/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two strings `s` and `t` of the same length `n`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- Expected output: The minimum number of operations required to make `s` an anti-palindrome, or -1 if it's impossible.
- Key requirements: An anti-palindrome is a string that is not the same when reversed. The allowed operations are replacing a character in `s` with the corresponding character in `t`.
- Example test cases:
  - `s = "abc", t = "bca"`: Output `2` because we can replace the first character `a` with `b` and the last character `c` with `a`.
  - `s = "abc", t = "abc"`: Output `-1` because it's impossible to make `s` an anti-palindrome.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of replacing characters in `s` with characters from `t`.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate over each character in `s`.
  2. For each character, try replacing it with the corresponding character from `t`.
  3. Check if the resulting string is an anti-palindrome.
  4. If it is, count the number of replacements made.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int makeStringAntiPalindromeBruteForce(std::string s, std::string t) {
    int n = s.length();
    int minOperations = n + 1; // Initialize with a value greater than the maximum possible operations

    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        std::string temp = s;
        int operations = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                temp[i] = t[i];
                operations++;
            }
        }

        bool isAntiPalindrome = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            if (temp[i] == temp[n - 1 - i]) {
                isAntiPalindrome = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isAntiPalindrome && operations < minOperations) {
            minOperations = operations;
        }
    }

    return minOperations == n + 1 ? -1 : minOperations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of the strings. This is because we generate all possible subsets of characters to replace (which is $2^n$) and for each subset, we iterate over the string to check if it's an anti-palindrome.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we create a temporary string of the same length as the input strings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inherently expensive due to the exponential number of combinations it checks, leading to high time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we only need to store one additional string of the same length as the inputs.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We only need to replace characters to make the string an anti-palindrome if there are matching characters in the first and second halves of the string.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Iterate over the first half of the string.
  2. For each pair of characters (one from the first half and one from the second half), check if they are equal.
  3. If a pair of equal characters is found and the corresponding characters in `t` are different, increment the operation count.
  4. If no such pair is found but there are pairs of characters that can be made unequal by replacing with characters from `t`, increment the operation count accordingly.

```cpp
int makeStringAntiPalindromeOptimal(std::string s, std::string t) {
    int n = s.length();
    int operations = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
        if (s[i] == s[n - 1 - i]) {
            if (s[i] != t[i] || s[i] != t[n - 1 - i]) {
                operations++;
            } else {
                // If all characters are the same and cannot be made different, return -1
                return -1;
            }
        }
    }

    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the strings. This is because we only need to iterate over half of the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the operation count and indices.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly addresses the requirement of making the string an anti-palindrome by only considering the necessary operations to make unequal pairs of characters. It does so in linear time, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem since we must at least read the input strings once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Bit manipulation in the brute force approach, and efficient iteration in the optimal approach.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the goal (making a string an anti-palindrome).
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the problem space by focusing on the critical aspects (pairs of characters that need to be made unequal).
- Similar problems to practice: Other string manipulation problems, such as finding the longest palindromic substring or making a string a palindrome.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases (like when the strings are already anti-palindromes or when all characters are the same).
- Edge cases to watch for: Strings of odd length, strings that are already anti-palindromes, and strings where all characters are the same.
- Performance pitfalls: Using brute force approaches for large inputs, not optimizing the iteration over the strings.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and large strings.
