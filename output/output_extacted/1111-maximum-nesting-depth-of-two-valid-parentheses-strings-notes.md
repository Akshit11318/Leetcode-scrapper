## Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-two-valid-parentheses-strings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two strings `seq1` and `seq2`, each containing only parentheses `()` and `[]`.
- Constraints: Both strings are non-empty, and their lengths are less than or equal to 200.
- Expected Output: The maximum nesting depth of valid parentheses in `seq1` and `seq2` combined.
- Key Requirements:
  - A string of parentheses is valid if every open parenthesis can be matched with a corresponding closing parenthesis, and the pairs of parentheses are properly nested.
  - The maximum nesting depth of a string of parentheses is the maximum number of open parentheses that are not yet closed.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `seq1 = "(()())"`, `seq2 = "()(())"`, the maximum nesting depth is 3.
  - `seq1 = "(())"`, `seq2 = "()"`, the maximum nesting depth is 2.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through each character in both strings, tracking the current nesting depth by incrementing it when encountering an open parenthesis and decrementing it when encountering a close parenthesis.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize the maximum nesting depth to 0.
  2. Iterate through each character in `seq1` and `seq2`.
  3. For each open parenthesis, increment the current nesting depth.
  4. For each close parenthesis, decrement the current nesting depth.
  5. Update the maximum nesting depth if the current depth is greater.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to track the nesting depth as we iterate through the strings.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(string seq1, string seq2) {
        int maxDepth = 0;
        int currDepth1 = 0, currDepth2 = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < seq1.size(); ++i) {
            if (seq1[i] == '(' || seq1[i] == '[') {
                currDepth1++;
            } else if (seq1[i] == ')' || seq1[i] == ']') {
                currDepth1--;
            }
            maxDepth = max(maxDepth, currDepth1);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < seq2.size(); ++i) {
            if (seq2[i] == '(' || seq2[i] == '[') {
                currDepth2++;
            } else if (seq2[i] == ')' || seq2[i] == ']') {
                currDepth2--;
            }
            maxDepth = max(maxDepth, currDepth2);
        }
        
        return maxDepth;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `seq1` and `seq2`, respectively. This is because we make a single pass through each string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum and current nesting depths.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we iterate through each character in the strings once. The space complexity is constant because we use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The problem doesn't require us to validate the sequences or handle edge cases where the sequences are invalid. We can directly calculate the maximum nesting depth by tracking the current depth as we iterate through the strings.
- Detailed breakdown: We can improve the brute force approach by removing unnecessary checks and directly updating the maximum depth.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it makes a single pass through each string, resulting in a linear time complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(string seq1, string seq2) {
        int maxDepth = 0;
        
        int currDepth = 0;
        for (char c : seq1) {
            if (c == '(' || c == '[') {
                currDepth++;
                maxDepth = max(maxDepth, currDepth);
            } else if (c == ')' || c == ']') {
                currDepth--;
            }
        }
        
        currDepth = 0;
        for (char c : seq2) {
            if (c == '(' || c == '[') {
                currDepth++;
                maxDepth = max(maxDepth, currDepth);
            } else if (c == ')' || c == ']') {
                currDepth--;
            }
        }
        
        return maxDepth;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts: Iteration, tracking maximum values.
- Problem-solving patterns: Direct calculation, single pass through the input.
- Optimization techniques: Removing unnecessary checks, direct updates.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly updating the current or maximum nesting depths.
- Edge cases to watch for: Invalid input sequences, but the problem statement guarantees valid input.
- Performance pitfalls: Using more complex data structures or algorithms than necessary.
- Testing considerations: Test with different input sequences, including edge cases like single-character sequences or sequences with only open or close parentheses.
