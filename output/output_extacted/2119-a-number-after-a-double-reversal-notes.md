## A Number After a Double Reversal
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/a-number-after-a-double-reversal/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer `num`.
- Constraints: $0 \leq num \leq 10^6$.
- Expected output format: An integer representing the number after a double reversal.
- Key requirements: Implement a function that takes an integer as input and returns the number after a double reversal.
- Edge cases: Handle cases where the input number is 0 or negative.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `num = 526`
    - Output: `526`
    - Explanation: First reverse: `526` -> `625`, Second reverse: `625` -> `526`.
  - Input: `num = 0`
    - Output: `0`
    - Explanation: First reverse: `0` -> `0`, Second reverse: `0` -> `0`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Reverse the number twice to get the final result.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Convert the number to a string to easily reverse it.
  2. Reverse the string representation of the number.
  3. Convert the reversed string back to an integer.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 to perform the second reversal.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the problem description and is straightforward to implement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reversePrefix(int num) {
        string str = to_string(num);
        string reversedStr = str;
        reverse(reversedStr.begin(), reversedStr.end());
        int reversedNum = stoi(reversedStr);
        str = to_string(reversedNum);
        reversedStr = str;
        reverse(reversedStr.begin(), reversedStr.end());
        return stoi(reversedStr);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(log(n))$ because we are converting the number to a string, reversing it, and converting it back to an integer twice. The number of digits in `num` is $log(n)$, so each conversion and reversal takes $O(log(n))$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(log(n))$ because we are storing the string representation of the number, which has $log(n)$ characters.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The conversion between integers and strings and the reversal of strings are the main contributors to these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Recognize that reversing a number twice results in the original number.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The function can simply return the input number as it is, because reversing it twice will yield the same number.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has the best possible time and space complexity because it involves no additional operations beyond returning the input.
- Why further optimization is impossible: There are no operations to optimize; the function simply returns the input.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reversePrefix(int num) {
        return num;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are simply returning the input number without any additional operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because it has the lowest possible time and space complexity for the given problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Understanding the properties of reversing operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Recognizing that sometimes the most straightforward or naive approach can be optimal if the problem allows for it.
- Optimization techniques learned: Looking for properties of the problem that can simplify the solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve string or number manipulation and reversal.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Overcomplicating the solution by not recognizing the properties of the problem.
- Edge cases to watch for: Always consider the simplest cases (e.g., input 0) to ensure the solution works as expected.
- Performance pitfalls: Not recognizing that sometimes the simplest approach can be the most efficient.
- Testing considerations: Test with a variety of inputs, including edge cases like 0 and negative numbers, to ensure the solution is robust.
