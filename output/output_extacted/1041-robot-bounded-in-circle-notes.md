## Robot Bounded In Circle
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A string `instructions` containing the instructions for the robot.
- Constraints: `1 <= instructions.length <= 100`.
- Expected output format: `true` if the robot will be bounded in a circle after executing the instructions, `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - The robot starts at the origin `(0, 0)` and faces north.
    - The robot moves in a 2D plane.
    - The robot can only move in the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).
    - The instructions are given as a string containing the characters 'G', 'L', and 'R', which represent moving forward, turning left, and turning right, respectively.
    - Example test cases: 
        - Input: `instructions = "GGLLGG"`; Output: `true`.
        - Input: `instructions = "GG"`; Output: `false`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The robot's movements can be simulated by iterating through the instructions and updating the robot's position and direction accordingly.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize the robot's position and direction.
    2. Iterate through the instructions.
    3. For each instruction, update the robot's position and direction accordingly.
    4. After executing all instructions, check if the robot is back at the origin or if the robot's direction has changed.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be efficient for large inputs.

```cpp
bool isRobotBounded(string instructions) {
    int x = 0, y = 0;
    int dx = 0, dy = 1;
    for (char c : instructions) {
        if (c == 'G') {
            x += dx;
            y += dy;
        } else if (c == 'L') {
            int temp = dx;
            dx = -dy;
            dy = temp;
        } else if (c == 'R') {
            int temp = dx;
            dx = dy;
            dy = -temp;
        }
    }
    return (x == 0 && y == 0) || (dx != 0 || dy != 1);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the instructions string.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the space used does not grow with the size of the input.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we iterate through the instructions string once. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the robot's position and direction.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The robot will be bounded in a circle if and only if the robot's direction has changed after executing all instructions or if the robot is back at the origin.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Initialize the robot's position and direction.
    2. Iterate through the instructions.
    3. For each instruction, update the robot's position and direction accordingly.
    4. After executing all instructions, check if the robot's direction has changed or if the robot is back at the origin.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the instructions string, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The time complexity is already linear, and we cannot do better than that because we must at least read the input string.

```cpp
bool isRobotBounded(string instructions) {
    int x = 0, y = 0;
    int dx = 0, dy = 1;
    for (char c : instructions) {
        if (c == 'G') {
            x += dx;
            y += dy;
        } else if (c == 'L') {
            int temp = dx;
            dx = -dy;
            dy = temp;
        } else if (c == 'R') {
            int temp = dx;
            dx = dy;
            dy = -temp;
        }
    }
    return (x == 0 && y == 0) || (dx != 0 || dy != 1);
}
```

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Simulating the robot's movements and checking if the robot is bounded in a circle.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a simple iterative approach to solve the problem.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, as the optimal solution is already straightforward and efficient.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving simulating movements or checking if a robot is bounded in a circle.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not updating the robot's position and direction correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: The robot's direction changing after executing all instructions or the robot being back at the origin.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient algorithm with a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
