## Water Bottles II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `numBottles` (the number of bottles), `numExchange` (the number of bottles that can be exchanged for a new one), and `numDollars` (the initial amount of money).
- Output: The total number of bottles that can be bought or obtained through exchange.
- Key requirements: Determine how many bottles can be bought with the given dollars and how many more can be obtained by exchanging empty bottles.
- Example test cases:
  - `numBottles = 9`, `numExchange = 3`, `numDollars = 0`. The output should be `13`.
  - `numBottles = 15`, `numExchange = 4`, `numDollars = 10`. The output should be `19`.
  - `numBottles = 5`, `numExchange = 5`, `numDollars = 450`. The output should be `476`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the initial number of bottles that can be bought with the given dollars. Then, simulate the process of exchanging empty bottles for new ones until no more exchanges are possible.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Calculate the initial number of bottles that can be bought with the given dollars.
  2. Simulate the exchange process by keeping track of empty bottles and new bottles obtained through exchange.
  3. Repeat step 2 until no more exchanges are possible.

```cpp
int numBottles, numExchange, numDollars;
int totalBottles = numBottles + numDollars;
int emptyBottles = totalBottles;

while (emptyBottles >= numExchange) {
    int newBottles = emptyBottles / numExchange;
    totalBottles += newBottles;
    emptyBottles = newBottles + (emptyBottles % numExchange);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\frac{numBottles + numDollars}{numExchange})$, where the number of iterations depends on the number of exchanges possible.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of space is used.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the while loop, which continues until no more exchanges are possible. The space complexity is constant because only a few variables are used.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of simulating the exchange process, we can directly calculate the total number of bottles that can be obtained.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Calculate the initial number of bottles that can be bought with the given dollars.
  2. Calculate the total number of empty bottles that can be exchanged for new ones.
  3. Add the initial number of bottles and the total number of new bottles obtained through exchange.

```cpp
int numBottles, numExchange, numDollars;
int totalBottles = numBottles + numDollars;
int emptyBottles = totalBottles;

int newBottles = 0;
while (emptyBottles >= numExchange) {
    int temp = emptyBottles / numExchange;
    newBottles += temp;
    emptyBottles = temp + (emptyBottles % numExchange);
}

totalBottles += newBottles;
```
Alternatively, we can use a mathematical formula to directly calculate the total number of bottles:
```cpp
int numBottles, numExchange, numDollars;
int totalBottles = numBottles + numDollars;

int emptyBottles = totalBottles;
while (emptyBottles >= numExchange) {
    emptyBottles = emptyBottles / numExchange + emptyBottles % numExchange;
    totalBottles += emptyBottles / numExchange;
}

```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\frac{numBottles + numDollars}{numExchange})$, where the number of iterations depends on the number of exchanges possible.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of space is used.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the total number of bottles that can be obtained, eliminating the need for unnecessary simulations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts: Simulation, mathematical modeling, and optimization.
- Problem-solving patterns: Identifying key insights and using mathematical formulas to simplify complex problems.
- Optimization techniques: Eliminating unnecessary simulations and using direct calculations to improve efficiency.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to handle edge cases and not considering the impact of integer division on the result.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `numExchange` is 1 or where `numBottles` and `numDollars` are 0.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms that lead to high time complexities.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with different input values to ensure correctness and efficiency.
