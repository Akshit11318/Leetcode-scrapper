## Count Special Integers
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-special-integers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `n`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^6`.
- Expected Output: The number of special integers in the range `[1, n]`.
- Key Requirements: A special integer is defined as an integer whose digits are strictly increasing.
- Edge Cases: Single-digit numbers are considered special.

**Example Test Cases:**
- For `n = 5`, the special integers are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, so the output is `5`.
- For `n = 20`, the special integers are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]`, so the output is `19`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking each number from `1` to `n` to see if it is special.
- This involves converting each number to a string to easily access its digits.
- Then, we compare each digit with its previous one to ensure they are strictly increasing.

```cpp
int countSpecialIntegers(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        string str = to_string(i);
        bool isSpecial = true;
        for (int j = 1; j < str.length(); j++) {
            if (str[j] <= str[j-1]) {
                isSpecial = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isSpecial) count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the input number and $m$ is the average number of digits in the numbers from `1` to `n`. This is because for each number, we potentially check all its digits.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, for storing the string representation of each number.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks every number, leading to linear time complexity in terms of the input size, and for each number, it checks all digits, leading to a factor of $m$ in the time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a combinatorial approach based on the fact that a special integer can be formed by selecting a subset of digits from `1` to `9` without repetition.
- We can use bit manipulation to represent the selection of digits for each special integer.
- However, a more straightforward approach involves recognizing the pattern of special integers and using combinatorial formulas to count them.

```cpp
int countSpecialIntegers(int n) {
    vector<int> count(10, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
        count[i] = 1;
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 1; j--) {
            count[i] += count[j];
        }
    }
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        string str = to_string(i);
        if (str.length() > 10) break; // Since we cannot have more than 10 distinct digits
        int temp = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < str.length(); j++) {
            int digit = str[j] - '0';
            temp += count[digit];
            if (j > 0 && str[j] <= str[j-1]) {
                break;
            }
            if (j == str.length() - 1) {
                result++;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
However, a simpler and more efficient way to solve this is by realizing we can use a combinatorial method to calculate the number of special integers up to `n` without actually generating them.

```cpp
int countSpecialIntegers(int n) {
    int ans = 0;
    for (int len = 1; len <= 10; len++) {
        vector<int> dp(len + 1);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int d = 1; d <= 9; d++) {
            for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                for (int j = 0; j < d; j++) {
                    if (i > 0) dp[i] += dp[i-1];
                }
            }
        }
        ans += dp[len];
    }
    return min(ans, n);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the number of operations does not depend on the input size `n`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the space used does not grow with the input size `n`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it avoids generating all special integers and instead uses a mathematical formula to count them directly.
