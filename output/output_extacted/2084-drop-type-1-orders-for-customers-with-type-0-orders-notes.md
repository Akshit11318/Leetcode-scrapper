## Drop Type-1 Orders for Customers with Type-0 Orders

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/drop-type-1-orders-for-customers-with-type-0-orders/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a table `Orders` containing `order_id`, `customer_id`, and `order_type`, where `order_type` can be either 0 or 1. 
- Expected output format: Write a SQL query to delete all rows with `order_type` = 1 for customers who have an `order_type` = 0.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Ensure that only customers with at least one `order_type` = 0 have their `order_type` = 1 orders deleted.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - If a customer has only `order_type` = 1 orders, none should be deleted.
  - If a customer has both `order_type` = 0 and `order_type` = 1 orders, only the `order_type` = 1 orders should be deleted.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One might initially think to select all customers with `order_type` = 0 and then delete all their `order_type` = 1 orders.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Select all distinct `customer_id` from the `Orders` table where `order_type` = 0.
  2. For each of these `customer_id`, delete all rows from the `Orders` table where `order_type` = 1.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the requirement to identify customers with `order_type` = 0 and then remove their `order_type` = 1 orders.

```sql
DELETE FROM Orders 
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id 
  FROM Orders 
  WHERE order_type = 0
) AND order_type = 1;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Orders` table. This is because for each customer with `order_type` = 0, we potentially delete multiple rows.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ since we are not using any additional data structures that scale with input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The subquery to select `customer_id` with `order_type` = 0 could potentially scan the entire table, and for each of these customers, we may delete multiple rows, leading to the $O(n^2)$ time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same query as the brute force approach is actually the optimal solution in terms of SQL queries because it directly addresses the problem statement without unnecessary complexity. The initial thought process leads to a straightforward and efficient SQL query.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The query directly identifies the `customer_id` with `order_type` = 0 and deletes the corresponding `order_type` = 1 rows in one step.
- Proof of optimality: This query cannot be further optimized in terms of the number of operations (select and delete) because it directly targets the required rows without intermediate steps.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Any attempt to optimize further would likely involve additional operations or subqueries, which would not reduce the overall complexity of the query.

```sql
DELETE FROM Orders 
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id 
  FROM Orders 
  WHERE order_type = 0
) AND order_type = 1;
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Orders` table. Modern databases optimize the subquery and the delete operation to run in linear time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ since we are not using any additional data structures that scale with input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** The database engine is optimized to handle such queries efficiently, often using indexes and other optimization techniques to minimize the time complexity.
