## Maximum Area Rectangle with Point Constraints II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-area-rectangle-with-point-constraints-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `points` - a list of points in a 2D plane, each represented as an array of two integers `[x, y]`.
- Constraints: `1 <= points.length <= 5 * 10^4`, `0 <= points[i][0] <= 10^9`, `0 <= points[i][1] <= 10^9`.
- Expected output: The maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed using the given points as vertices.
- Key requirements: The rectangle must have its sides parallel to the x and y axes, and it must contain at least one of the given points as a vertex.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking all possible pairs of points to form the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible pairs of points.
  2. For each pair, calculate the area of the rectangle that can be formed using these points as the top-left and bottom-right corners.
  3. Keep track of the maximum area found.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxArea(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    int maxArea = 0;
    int n = points.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            // Calculate the area for each pair of points
            int x1 = points[i][0], y1 = points[i][1];
            int x2 = points[j][0], y2 = points[j][1];
            int area = std::abs(x2 - x1) * std::abs(y2 - y1);
            
            // Check if the rectangle can be formed with the given points
            if (x1 != x2 && y1 != y2) {
                maxArea = std::max(maxArea, area);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxArea;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of points. This is because we are generating all possible pairs of points.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the maximum area.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking all possible pairs of points, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.

### Better Approach

There isn't a significantly better approach than the brute force in terms of reducing the time complexity without using additional data structures or insights. The problem can be optimized using a different perspective, focusing on the properties of rectangles and the given constraints.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to recognize that for any two points, we can form a rectangle if and only if there are two other points that share the same x-coordinates and y-coordinates with the first two points, respectively.
- We can use a `std::set` to store the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points for efficient lookups.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

int maxArea(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    int maxArea = 0;
    std::set<int> xCoords, yCoords;
    
    // Store x and y coordinates in sets
    for (auto& point : points) {
        xCoords.insert(point[0]);
        yCoords.insert(point[1]);
    }
    
    // Generate all possible pairs of x and y coordinates
    for (int x1 : xCoords) {
        for (int x2 : xCoords) {
            if (x1 >= x2) continue; // Ensure x1 < x2
            
            for (int y1 : yCoords) {
                for (int y2 : yCoords) {
                    if (y1 >= y2) continue; // Ensure y1 < y2
                    
                    // Check if all four points exist
                    if (std::find_if(points.begin(), points.end(), [&](const std::vector<int>& point) {
                        return point[0] == x1 && point[1] == y1;
                    }) != points.end() &&
                        std::find_if(points.begin(), points.end(), [&](const std::vector<int>& point) {
                            return point[0] == x1 && point[1] == y2;
                        }) != points.end() &&
                        std::find_if(points.begin(), points.end(), [&](const std::vector<int>& point) {
                            return point[0] == x2 && point[1] == y1;
                        }) != points.end() &&
                        std::find_if(points.begin(), points.end(), [&](const std::vector<int>& point) {
                            return point[0] == x2 && point[1] == y2;
                        }) != points.end()) {
                        // Calculate the area of the rectangle
                        int area = std::abs(x2 - x1) * std::abs(y2 - y1);
                        maxArea = std::max(maxArea, area);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxArea;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of unique x and y coordinates, respectively.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of recognizing the properties of rectangles and the constraints given in the problem.
- The use of `std::set` for efficient lookups of x and y coordinates.
- The generation of all possible pairs of x and y coordinates to form rectangles.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not ensuring that the x-coordinates and y-coordinates are distinct when generating pairs.
- Not checking if all four points exist before calculating the area of the rectangle.
- Not using efficient data structures like `std::set` for storing and looking up coordinates.
