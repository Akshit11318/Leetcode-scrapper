## Maximum Spending After Buying Items

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-spending-after-buying-items/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an array of integers `savings` and an integer `start`, and returns the maximum spending after buying items.
- Expected output format: The function should return an integer representing the maximum spending.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The function should handle cases where the input array is empty, and where the start index is out of bounds.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `savings = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `start = 1`, Output: `12`
  - Example 2: Input: `savings = [5,0,0,7,0,0]`, `start = 0`, Output: `7`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible combinations of buying and not buying each item, and keeping track of the maximum spending.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `max_spending` to 0.
  2. Iterate over all possible combinations of buying and not buying each item.
  3. For each combination, calculate the total spending.
  4. Update `max_spending` if the current combination has a higher spending.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it has an exponential time complexity due to the number of possible combinations.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maximumSpending(std::vector<int>& savings, int start) {
    int max_spending = 0;
    int n = savings.size();
    
    // Iterate over all possible combinations
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        int spending = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                spending += savings[(start + i) % n];
            }
        }
        max_spending = std::max(max_spending, spending);
    }
    
    return max_spending;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of items. This is because we are iterating over all possible combinations of buying and not buying each item, and for each combination, we are calculating the total spending.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `max_spending` variable and the loop variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are using a brute force approach, trying all possible combinations of buying and not buying each item. The space complexity is low because we are not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum spending. We can maintain a window of size $k$, where $k$ is the number of items we are considering buying, and slide this window over the array to find the maximum spending.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable `max_spending` to 0.
  2. Iterate over all possible window sizes $k$.
  3. For each window size $k$, iterate over all possible start positions for the window.
  4. For each window, calculate the total spending by summing up the savings of the items in the window.
  5. Update `max_spending` if the current window has a higher spending.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible combinations of buying and not buying each item, and it does so in a way that avoids redundant calculations.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maximumSpending(std::vector<int>& savings, int start) {
    int max_spending = 0;
    int n = savings.size();
    
    // Iterate over all possible window sizes
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        // Iterate over all possible start positions for the window
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int spending = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                spending += savings[(start + i + j) % n];
            }
            max_spending = std::max(max_spending, spending);
        }
    }
    
    return max_spending;
}
```
