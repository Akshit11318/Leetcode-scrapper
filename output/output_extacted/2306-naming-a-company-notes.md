## Naming a Company
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/naming-a-company/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves finding the number of ways to choose a company name from a list of `2`-character company names and a list of `2`-character initials. The input consists of a list of `2`-character company names and a list of `2`-character initials, both of which are represented as strings. The constraints are that the company name must be unique and must not be the same as any of the initials.
- Expected output format: The output should be the number of ways to choose a company name.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The key requirement is to ensure that the company name is unique and not the same as any of the initials. Edge cases include an empty list of company names or initials, and cases where the company name is the same as one of the initials.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if the list of company names is `["newco","newco","newco","startco","startco","startco"]` and the list of initials is `["n","s","s"]`, the output should be `3` because there are three unique company names that can be chosen.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The initial thought process is to iterate over the list of company names and count the number of unique names that do not match any of the initials.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a set to store unique company names.
  2. Iterate over the list of company names.
  3. For each company name, check if it is not in the set of unique names and does not match any of the initials.
  4. If the company name meets the conditions, add it to the set of unique names.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach comes to mind first because it is a straightforward way to solve the problem by iterating over the list of company names and checking each one against the list of initials.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

int numUniqueNames(vector<string>& names, vector<string>& initials) {
    unordered_set<string> uniqueNames;
    for (string name : names) {
        bool isValid = true;
        for (string initial : initials) {
            if (name == initial) {
                isValid = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isValid && uniqueNames.find(name) == uniqueNames.end()) {
            uniqueNames.insert(name);
        }
    }
    return uniqueNames.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of company names and $m$ is the number of initials. This is because for each company name, we iterate over the list of initials.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of company names. This is because we use a set to store unique company names.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we use a nested loop to iterate over the list of company names and the list of initials, and we use a set to store unique company names.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a set to store unique company names and another set to store initials. This allows us to check if a company name is valid in constant time.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a set to store unique company names.
  2. Initialize a set to store initials.
  3. Iterate over the list of initials and add each one to the set of initials.
  4. Iterate over the list of company names.
  5. For each company name, check if it is not in the set of unique names and does not match any of the initials in the set of initials.
  6. If the company name meets the conditions, add it to the set of unique names.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a set to store unique company names and another set to store initials, allowing us to check if a company name is valid in constant time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

int numUniqueNames(vector<string>& names, vector<string>& initials) {
    unordered_set<string> uniqueNames;
    unordered_set<string> initialsSet;
    for (string initial : initials) {
        initialsSet.insert(initial);
    }
    for (string name : names) {
        if (initialsSet.find(name) == initialsSet.end() && uniqueNames.find(name) == uniqueNames.end()) {
            uniqueNames.insert(name);
        }
    }
    return uniqueNames.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of company names and $m$ is the number of initials. This is because we iterate over the list of company names and the list of initials separately.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of company names and $m$ is the number of initials. This is because we use two sets to store unique company names and initials.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses sets to store unique company names and initials, allowing us to check if a company name is valid in constant time.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem demonstrates the use of sets to store unique elements and check for membership in constant time.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires identifying the key insight that leads to the optimal solution, which is using sets to store unique company names and initials.
- Optimization techniques learned: The problem teaches the importance of using data structures such as sets to optimize the solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Similar problems include finding the number of unique elements in a list, checking for membership in a set, and optimizing solutions using data structures.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Common implementation errors include using a nested loop to iterate over the list of company names and the list of initials, which leads to a time complexity of $O(n \cdot m)$.
- Edge cases to watch for: Edge cases include an empty list of company names or initials, and cases where the company name is the same as one of the initials.
- Performance pitfalls: Performance pitfalls include using a data structure that does not allow for efficient membership checking, such as a list.
- Testing considerations: Testing considerations include testing the solution with different inputs, such as an empty list of company names or initials, and cases where the company name is the same as one of the initials.
