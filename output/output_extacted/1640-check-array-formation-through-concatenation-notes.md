## Check Array Formation Through Concatenation

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-array-formation-through-concatenation/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two arrays `pieces` and `start`.
- Constraints: `1 <= pieces.length <= 100`, `1 <= pieces[i].length <= 100`, `1 <= start.length <= 1000`, `1 <= start[i].length <= 100`.
- Expected Output: `true` if `start` array can be formed by concatenating the arrays in `pieces`, `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling empty arrays, arrays with a single element, arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays with varying lengths.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `pieces = ["the","q","a","there","an","thing","your","do"], start = ["the","there","an","thing","your","do"]` returns `true`.
  - `pieces = ["the","q","a","there","an","thing","your","do"], start = ["the","there","an","q","thing","your","do"]` returns `false`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The simplest approach is to generate all permutations of the `pieces` array and check if any of these permutations, when concatenated, matches the `start` array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of the `pieces` array.
  2. For each permutation, concatenate the strings.
  3. Compare the concatenated string with the `start` array to see if they match.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem by considering all possible arrangements of the `pieces` array.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void permute(vector<string>& pieces, int start, vector<string>& result, string& current) {
    if (start == pieces.size()) {
        result.push_back(current);
        return;
    }
    for (int i = start; i < pieces.size(); ++i) {
        swap(pieces[start], pieces[i]);
        current += pieces[start];
        permute(pieces, start + 1, result, current);
        current.erase(current.size() - pieces[start].size());
        swap(pieces[start], pieces[i]);
    }
}

bool canFormArray(vector<string>& pieces, vector<string>& start) {
    vector<string> permutations;
    string current = "";
    permute(pieces, 0, permutations, current);
    
    for (const auto& perm : permutations) {
        string concatenated = "";
        for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
            concatenated += piece;
        }
        if (concatenated == start[0]) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> pieces = {"the","q","a","there","an","thing","your","do"};
    vector<string> start = {"the","there","an","thing","your","do"};
    cout << boolalpha << canFormArray(pieces, start) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n! \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of pieces and $m$ is the maximum length of a piece. This is because we generate all permutations of the pieces and then concatenate them.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n! \cdot m)$, as we need to store all permutations.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The permutation generation leads to factorial time complexity, and storing all permutations leads to factorial space complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all permutations, we can try to match the `start` array by concatenating the `pieces` in the order they appear in `start`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty string to store the concatenated pieces.
  2. Iterate through the `start` array.
  3. For each string in `start`, check if it matches any of the remaining pieces.
  4. If a match is found, remove the piece from the list of available pieces and concatenate it to the current string.
  5. If no match is found for any string in `start`, return `false`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly constructs the `start` array from the `pieces` without considering unnecessary permutations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

bool canFormArray(vector<string>& pieces, vector<string>& start) {
    unordered_set<string> pieceSet(pieces.begin(), pieces.end());
    string concatenated = "";
    
    for (const auto& s : start) {
        if (pieceSet.find(s) == pieceSet.end()) {
            return false;
        }
        concatenated += s;
        pieceSet.erase(s);
    }
    
    return true;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> pieces = {"the","q","a","there","an","thing","your","do"};
    vector<string> start = {"the","there","an","thing","your","do"};
    cout << boolalpha << canFormArray(pieces, start) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of pieces and $m$ is the maximum length of a piece. This is because we iterate through the `start` array and perform constant time operations for each piece.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we store the pieces in a set.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly constructs the `start` array from the `pieces` without considering unnecessary permutations, leading to linear time complexity.
