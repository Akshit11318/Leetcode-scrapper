## Minimum Levels to Gain More Points
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-levels-to-gain-more-points/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves two arrays `gain` and `points`, where `gain[i]` represents the points gained at the `i-th` level and `points[i]` represents the points required to reach the `i-th` level. The goal is to find the minimum number of levels required to gain more points than the total points required to reach all levels.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of levels required.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where it's impossible to gain more points than required, and optimizing the solution for large inputs.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `gain = [5, -4, -2, 4, 5], points = [3, 4, 2, 5, 1]`. The output should be `3`.
  - Example 2: `gain = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], points = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`. The output should be `-1` if it's impossible to gain more points than required.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of levels to find the minimum number required to gain more points than the total points required.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the total points required to reach all levels.
  2. Iterate through each level and add the points required to reach that level to the total.
  3. Initialize another variable to store the total points gained.
  4. Iterate through each level again, and for each level, add the points gained at that level to the total points gained.
  5. Check if the total points gained is greater than the total points required. If it is, return the current level as the minimum number of levels required.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that tries all possible combinations of levels.

```cpp
#include <vector>

int minimumLevels(std::vector<int>& gain, std::vector<int>& points) {
    int totalPointsRequired = 0;
    for (int point : points) {
        totalPointsRequired += point;
    }
    
    int totalPointsGained = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < gain.size(); i++) {
        totalPointsGained += gain[i];
        if (totalPointsGained > totalPointsRequired) {
            return i + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // Impossible to gain more points than required
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of levels. This is because we're iterating through the levels twice.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're only using a constant amount of space to store the total points required and gained.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we're iterating through the levels twice, and the space complexity is constant because we're not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a single pass through the levels to calculate the total points gained and required, and return the minimum number of levels required as soon as we gain more points than required.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize variables to store the total points gained and required.
  2. Iterate through each level, adding the points gained and required to their respective totals.
  3. Check if the total points gained is greater than the total points required after each level. If it is, return the current level as the minimum number of levels required.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the levels, and it returns the minimum number of levels required as soon as possible.

```cpp
#include <vector>

int minimumLevels(std::vector<int>& gain, std::vector<int>& points) {
    int totalPointsGained = 0;
    int totalPointsRequired = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < gain.size(); i++) {
        totalPointsRequired += points[i];
        totalPointsGained += gain[i];
        if (totalPointsGained > totalPointsRequired) {
            return i + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // Impossible to gain more points than required
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of levels. This is because we're only iterating through the levels once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're only using a constant amount of space to store the total points gained and required.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the levels, and it returns the minimum number of levels required as soon as possible.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Single-pass iteration, early termination.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a single pass to calculate multiple values, returning early to optimize performance.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the number of iterations, using constant space.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to initialize variables, using incorrect indices.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where it's impossible to gain more points than required, optimizing for large inputs.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary iterations or data structures that scale with the input size.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different input sizes, edge cases, and expected outputs.
