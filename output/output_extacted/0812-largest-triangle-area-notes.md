## Largest Triangle Area

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-triangle-area/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of points where each point is represented as an array of two integers, `[x, y]`.
- Constraints: `3 <= points.length <= 50` and `points[i].length == 2`.
- Expected output format: The largest possible area of a triangle that can be formed using the given points.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Ensure that the points form a valid triangle (i.e., the points are not collinear) and handle cases where the input array is empty or contains duplicate points.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0]]` returns `0.5` because the largest triangle area is formed by points `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, and `(1,0)`.
  - `points = [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2]]` returns `0` because the points are collinear.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the area of all possible triangles formed by the given points and find the maximum area.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of three points from the input array.
  2. For each combination, calculate the area of the triangle using the Shoelace formula.
  3. Keep track of the maximum area found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach that ensures all possible triangles are considered.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

double largestTriangleArea(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    double maxArea = 0;
    
    // Generate all possible combinations of three points
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                // Calculate the area of the triangle using the Shoelace formula
                double area = abs((points[i][0] * (points[j][1] - points[k][1]) +
                                   points[j][0] * (points[k][1] - points[i][1]) +
                                   points[k][0] * (points[i][1] - points[j][1])) / 2.0);
                
                // Update the maximum area if necessary
                maxArea = std::max(maxArea, area);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxArea;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of points. This is because we are generating all possible combinations of three points, which has a cubic time complexity.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity due to the nested loops used to generate all possible combinations of points. However, the space complexity is low since we are only using a constant amount of space to store the maximum area.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The Shoelace formula can be used to calculate the area of a triangle in $O(1)$ time, given the coordinates of its vertices.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of three points from the input array.
  2. For each combination, calculate the area of the triangle using the Shoelace formula.
  3. Keep track of the maximum area found.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible triangles that can be formed from the given points, and the Shoelace formula is an efficient way to calculate the area of a triangle.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

double largestTriangleArea(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    double maxArea = 0;
    
    // Generate all possible combinations of three points
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                // Calculate the area of the triangle using the Shoelace formula
                double area = abs((points[i][0] * (points[j][1] - points[k][1]) +
                                   points[j][0] * (points[k][1] - points[i][1]) +
                                   points[k][0] * (points[i][1] - points[j][1])) / 2.0);
                
                // Update the maximum area if necessary
                maxArea = std::max(maxArea, area);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxArea;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
