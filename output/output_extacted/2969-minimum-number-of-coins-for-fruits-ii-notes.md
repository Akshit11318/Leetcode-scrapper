## Minimum Number of Coins for Fruits II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-coins-for-fruits-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: You are given two integer arrays `fruits` and `coins`, where `fruits[i]` represents the type of fruit and `coins[i]` represents the number of coins for that fruit.
- Constraints: $1 \leq fruits.length \leq 100$, $1 \leq coins.length \leq 100$, $1 \leq fruits[i] \leq 100$, $1 \leq coins[i] \leq 100$.
- Expected output format: Return the minimum number of coins needed to buy all the fruits.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: All fruits must be bought, and each fruit can be bought only once.
- Example test cases with explanations: For `fruits = [1, 2, 3]` and `coins = [2, 3, 4]`, the minimum number of coins is `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Generate all possible combinations of fruits and calculate the total cost for each combination.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of the `fruits` array.
  2. For each permutation, calculate the total cost by summing up the corresponding coins.
  3. Keep track of the minimum total cost found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to explore all possible scenarios.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int minCoins(vector<int>& fruits, vector<int>& coins) {
    int n = fruits.size();
    int minCost = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all permutations
    do {
        int cost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cost += coins[i];
        }
        minCost = min(minCost, cost);
    } while (next_permutation(fruits.begin(), fruits.end()));
    
    return minCost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$, where $n$ is the number of fruits. This is because we're generating all permutations of the fruits.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we're only using a constant amount of space to store the minimum cost and the current permutation.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because generating all permutations has a factorial time complexity. The space complexity is low because we're not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Since the problem statement allows us to buy each fruit only once, we can simply sum up the coins for each fruit.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the total cost.
  2. Iterate through the `coins` array and add each coin to the total cost.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to buy all the fruits, without exploring any unnecessary combinations.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a linear time complexity, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
int minCoins(vector<int>& fruits, vector<int>& coins) {
    int totalCost = 0;
    for (int coin : coins) {
        totalCost += coin;
    }
    return totalCost;
}
```
