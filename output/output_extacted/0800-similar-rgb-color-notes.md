## Similar RGB Color

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/similar-rgb-color/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `color` representing the color in hexadecimal format.
- Output: The similar color in the same hexadecimal format.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The input string is in the format `#xxxxxx` where `x` is a hexadecimal digit.
  - The output should be the closest similar color by rounding each component to the nearest multiple of 11.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `color = "#09f166"`: The closest similar color is `#11ff77`.
  - `color = "#4e3fe1"`: The closest similar color is `#55ccdd`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Convert the hexadecimal string to RGB components, then round each component to the nearest multiple of 11.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Convert the hexadecimal string to RGB components.
  2. Round each component to the nearest multiple of 11.
  3. Convert the rounded RGB components back to a hexadecimal string.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string similarRGB(std::string color) {
    int r = stoi(color.substr(1, 2), 0, 16);
    int g = stoi(color.substr(3, 2), 0, 16);
    int b = stoi(color.substr(5, 2), 0, 16);

    r = (r + 5) / 11 * 11;
    g = (g + 5) / 11 * 11;
    b = (b + 5) / 11 * 11;

    char buffer[8];
    sprintf(buffer, "#%02x%02x%02x", r, g, b);
    return std::string(buffer);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we are performing a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we are using a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The number of operations does not depend on the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same as the brute force approach.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same as the brute force approach.
- Proof of optimality: The brute force approach already has a time complexity of $O(1)$, so it is optimal.

```cpp
// The same as the brute force approach
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Conversion between hexadecimal and decimal, rounding numbers.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, since the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving hexadecimal strings and rounding numbers.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking the input format, not handling edge cases.
- Edge cases to watch for: Input strings with invalid format, input strings with invalid hexadecimal digits.
- Performance pitfalls: None, since the optimal approach has a time complexity of $O(1)$.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input strings, including edge cases.
