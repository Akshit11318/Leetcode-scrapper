## Minimum Operations to Make Columns Strictly Increasing
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-columns-strictly-increasing/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a 2D array `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell contains a non-negative integer. The task is to make all columns strictly increasing by changing the value of any cell to any non-negative integer. The goal is to minimize the total number of operations.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations required.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input grid can have any number of rows and columns, and the values in the cells can be any non-negative integer.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `grid = [[3,2],[3,2]]`, the output should be `0` because no operations are needed.
  - For `grid = [[1,2],[2,1]]`, the output should be `1` because one operation is needed to make the columns strictly increasing.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible combinations of values for each cell in the grid and counting the number of operations required to make the columns strictly increasing for each combination.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over all possible combinations of values for each cell in the grid.
  2. For each combination, check if the columns are strictly increasing.
  3. If the columns are strictly increasing, count the number of operations required to achieve this.
  4. Keep track of the minimum number of operations required across all combinations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and ensures that all possible solutions are considered.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << (m * n)); mask++) {
        vector<vector<int>> newGrid = grid;
        int ops = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << (i * n + j))) != 0) {
                    newGrid[i][j] = 0;
                    ops++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        bool valid = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) {
                if (newGrid[i][j] >= newGrid[i + 1][j]) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!valid) break;
        }
        
        if (valid) {
            minOps = min(minOps, ops);
        }
    }
    
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{m \cdot n} \cdot m \cdot n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we are iterating over all possible combinations of values for each cell in the grid, and for each combination, we are checking if the columns are strictly increasing.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we need to store the new grid for each combination.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity because it involves trying all possible combinations of values for each cell in the grid. The space complexity is relatively low because we only need to store the new grid for each combination.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a greedy approach to solve this problem. The idea is to start from the top row and make sure that each column is strictly increasing. We can do this by iterating over each column and updating the values in the column to make it strictly increasing.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Iterate over each column in the grid.
  2. For each column, start from the top row and update the values in the column to make it strictly increasing.
  3. Keep track of the minimum number of operations required to make each column strictly increasing.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures that each column is strictly increasing with the minimum number of operations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int minOps = 0;
    
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        vector<int> col;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            col.push_back(grid[i][j]);
        }
        
        int ops = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            if (col[i] <= col[i - 1]) {
                ops += col[i - 1] - col[i] + 1;
                col[i] = col[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        
        minOps += ops;
    }
    
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we are iterating over each column in the grid and updating the values in the column to make it strictly increasing.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the number of rows in the grid. This is because we need to store the values in each column.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it ensures that each column is strictly increasing with the minimum number of operations. The time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input grid, making it efficient for large inputs.
