## Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-x-to-zero/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: You are given a non-negative integer array `nums` and a target integer `x`. Your goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to reduce `x` to zero. In one operation, you can either add or subtract the first or last element of the array from `x`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations required to reduce `x` to zero.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: If it is not possible to reduce `x` to zero, return `-1`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `nums = [1, 1, 4, 2, 3], x = 5`, Output: `2`
    Explanation: The optimal solution is to subtract the last element of the array from `x` twice.
  - Example 2: `nums = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], x = 4`, Output: `-1`
    Explanation: It is not possible to reduce `x` to zero.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of adding and subtracting the first and last elements of the array from `x`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Define a recursive function that takes the current value of `x` and the current indices of the array as arguments.
  2. In each recursive call, try adding and subtracting the first and last elements of the array from `x`.
  3. If `x` becomes zero, return the current number of operations.
  4. If `x` is not zero and all possible combinations have been tried, return `-1`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and tries all possible solutions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) sum += num;
        sum -= x;
        if (sum < 0) return -1;
        int left = 0, currentSum = 0;
        int maxLength = -1;
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            currentSum += nums[right];
            while (currentSum > sum) {
                currentSum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            if (currentSum == sum) {
                maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
            }
        }
        return maxLength == -1 ? -1 : n - maxLength;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are iterating over the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating over the array once, and the space complexity occurs because we are using a constant amount of space to store the variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a sliding window approach to find the longest subarray with a sum equal to `sum - x`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the sum of the array and subtract `x` from it.
  2. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the array.
  3. Initialize a variable `currentSum` to zero.
  4. Iterate over the array with the `right` pointer.
  5. Add the current element to `currentSum`.
  6. If `currentSum` is greater than `sum - x`, subtract the element at the `left` pointer from `currentSum` and increment the `left` pointer.
  7. If `currentSum` is equal to `sum - x`, update the maximum length of the subarray.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it tries all possible subarrays with a sum equal to `sum - x` in a single pass.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) sum += num;
        sum -= x;
        if (sum < 0) return -1;
        int left = 0, currentSum = 0;
        int maxLength = -1;
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            currentSum += nums[right];
            while (currentSum > sum) {
                currentSum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            if (currentSum == sum) {
                maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
            }
        }
        return maxLength == -1 ? -1 : n - maxLength;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sliding window approach, prefix sum.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a sliding window to find the longest subarray with a given sum.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a single pass to try all possible subarrays.
- Similar problems to practice: Find the longest subarray with a given sum, find the minimum window substring.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for the case where `sum - x` is negative.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `x` is greater than the sum of the array.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a recursive approach, which can lead to a time complexity of $O(2^n)$.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
