## First and Last Call on the Same Day

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/first-and-last-call-on-the-same-day/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `int n`, and two arrays `int firstCallTime[]` and `int lastCallTime[]` of size `n`, representing the first and last call times for each customer.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= firstCallTime[i], lastCallTime[i] <= 10^6`.
- Expected output: A boolean array where the `i-th` element is `true` if the `i-th` customer's first and last call are on the same day, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where the first and last call times are the same, and cases where the times are different but the dates are the same.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `n = 3`, `firstCallTime = [28, 28, 28]`, `lastCallTime = [28, 28, 29]`.
  - Output: `[true, true, false]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the date for each call time and compare the dates for the first and last calls of each customer.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Calculate the date for each call time by dividing the time by the number of seconds in a day (`86400`).
  2. Compare the dates for the first and last calls of each customer.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most straightforward way to solve the problem.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<bool> sameDayCalls(int n, std::vector<int>& firstCallTime, std::vector<int>& lastCallTime) {
    std::vector<bool> result(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Calculate the date for the first and last calls
        int firstDate = firstCallTime[i] / 86400;
        int lastDate = lastCallTime[i] / 86400;
        
        // Compare the dates
        result[i] = (firstDate == lastDate);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where `n` is the number of customers. This is because we are iterating over each customer once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where `n` is the number of customers. This is because we are storing the result for each customer in a vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are performing a constant amount of work for each customer, and the space complexity occurs because we are storing the result for each customer.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same insight as the brute force approach. The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach because the problem requires iterating over each customer once to calculate the result.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: Same as the brute force approach.
- Proof of optimality: The problem requires iterating over each customer once to calculate the result, so the optimal time complexity is $O(n)$.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<bool> sameDayCalls(int n, std::vector<int>& firstCallTime, std::vector<int>& lastCallTime) {
    std::vector<bool> result(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Calculate the date for the first and last calls
        int firstDate = firstCallTime[i] / 86400;
        int lastDate = lastCallTime[i] / 86400;
        
        // Compare the dates
        result[i] = (firstDate == lastDate);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** The problem requires iterating over each customer once to calculate the result, so the optimal time complexity is $O(n)$.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration over a list of customers, calculation of dates from times, comparison of dates.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires a straightforward iteration over each customer to calculate the result.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the problem requires a straightforward iteration over each customer to calculate the result.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that require iteration over a list of items to calculate a result.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to initialize the result vector, or using the wrong operator for comparison.
- Edge cases to watch for: Cases where the first and last call times are the same, and cases where the times are different but the dates are the same.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a data structure with a high time complexity for insertion or deletion, such as a linked list.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it produces the correct result.
