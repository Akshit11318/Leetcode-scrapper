## Clone N-ary Tree
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-n-ary-tree/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A `Node` object representing the root of an N-ary tree, where each `Node` has a `val` (integer value), a `children` list (list of child nodes), and a `clone` method to create a copy of the tree.
- Expected output format: The root of the cloned N-ary tree.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The tree can have any number of nodes, and each node can have any number of children. The cloning process should create a deep copy of the tree, meaning all nodes and their children are new objects.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - Cloning an empty tree should return `nullptr`.
  - Cloning a tree with a single node should return a new node with the same value.
  - Cloning a tree with multiple nodes and children should return a new tree with the same structure and values.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To clone an N-ary tree, we need to create a new node for each node in the original tree and recursively clone its children.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Create a new node with the same value as the current node.
  2. Iterate over the children of the current node and recursively clone each child.
  3. Add the cloned children to the new node's children list.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, recursive approach that mirrors the structure of the N-ary tree.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneTree(Node* root) {
        if (!root) return nullptr; // Base case: empty tree
        
        // Create a new node with the same value
        Node* newNode = new Node(root->val);
        
        // Recursively clone each child
        for (Node* child : root->children) {
            newNode->children.push_back(cloneTree(child));
        }
        
        return newNode;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the tree, since we visit each node once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$, since we create a new node for each node in the original tree.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The recursive approach ensures we visit each node once, resulting in linear time complexity. The space complexity is also linear because we create a new tree with the same number of nodes as the original tree.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal because it visits each node once and creates a new tree with the same structure.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same as the brute force approach, since it's already optimal.
- Proof of optimality: We cannot do better than visiting each node once, so the time complexity is optimal. The space complexity is also optimal because we must create a new tree with the same number of nodes.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We cannot avoid visiting each node at least once, and we must create a new tree with the same structure, so the time and space complexities are already optimal.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneTree(Node* root) {
        if (!root) return nullptr; // Base case: empty tree
        
        // Create a new node with the same value
        Node* newNode = new Node(root->val);
        
        // Recursively clone each child
        for (Node* child : root->children) {
            newNode->children.push_back(cloneTree(child));
        }
        
        return newNode;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Recursive tree traversal, node cloning.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Visiting each node once, creating a new tree with the same structure.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, since the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Cloning binary trees, graphs.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to handle the base case (empty tree), not recursively cloning each child.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty trees, trees with a single node.
- Performance pitfalls: None, since the optimal approach has linear time and space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test with empty trees, trees with a single node, and trees with multiple nodes and children.
