## The Category of Each Member in the Store

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/the-category-of-each-member-in-the-store/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes in two tables, `Members` and `Visits`. The `Members` table contains two columns, `member_id` and `name`. The `Visits` table contains three columns, `member_id`, `store_id`, and `visit_date`.
- Expected output format: The output should be a table with three columns, `member_id`, `store_id`, and `category`. The `category` column should be one of `'first time'`, `'returning'`, or `'regular'`, based on the visit history of each member.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - A member is considered `first time` if they have only one visit to a store.
  - A member is considered `returning` if they have two visits to a store.
  - A member is considered `regular` if they have three or more visits to a store.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If a member has one visit to a store, the category should be `first time`.
  - If a member has two visits to a store, the category should be `returning`.
  - If a member has three or more visits to a store, the category should be `regular`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first step is to think about how to calculate the number of visits for each member to each store. We can use a SQL query to group the visits by member and store, and then count the number of visits.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Calculate the number of visits for each member to each store.
  2. Use a `CASE` statement to determine the category based on the number of visits.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand. It directly calculates the number of visits for each member to each store, and then uses a simple `CASE` statement to determine the category.

```cpp
SELECT 
  m.member_id,
  v.store_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(v.visit_date) = 1 THEN 'first time'
    WHEN COUNT(v.visit_date) = 2 THEN 'returning'
    ELSE 'regular'
  END AS category
FROM 
  Members m
JOIN 
  Visits v ON m.member_id = v.member_id
GROUP BY 
  m.member_id, v.store_id
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Visits` table. This is because the query uses a `GROUP BY` clause, which requires sorting the data.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Visits` table. This is because the query requires storing the intermediate results of the `GROUP BY` clause.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The complexities occur because the query uses a `GROUP BY` clause, which requires sorting the data and storing the intermediate results.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a subquery to calculate the number of visits for each member to each store, and then use a `CASE` statement to determine the category.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Use a subquery to calculate the number of visits for each member to each store.
  2. Use a `CASE` statement to determine the category based on the number of visits.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a single query to calculate the number of visits for each member to each store, and then uses a simple `CASE` statement to determine the category.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because the query requires calculating the number of visits for each member to each store, which requires a `GROUP BY` clause. The `CASE` statement is also necessary to determine the category.

```cpp
SELECT 
  member_id,
  store_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN cnt = 1 THEN 'first time'
    WHEN cnt = 2 THEN 'returning'
    ELSE 'regular'
  END AS category
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      member_id,
      store_id,
      COUNT(visit_date) AS cnt
    FROM 
      Visits
    GROUP BY 
      member_id, store_id
  ) v
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem demonstrates the use of a `GROUP BY` clause and a `CASE` statement to calculate the number of visits for each member to each store and determine the category.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires identifying the number of visits for each member to each store and using a `CASE` statement to determine the category.
- Optimization techniques learned: The problem demonstrates the use of a subquery to calculate the number of visits for each member to each store, which can improve performance.
- Similar problems to practice: Similar problems include calculating the number of visits for each member to each store over a certain period of time, or determining the category of each member based on their visit history.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: A common implementation error is to forget to use a `GROUP BY` clause to calculate the number of visits for each member to each store.
- Edge cases to watch for: An edge case to watch for is when a member has no visits to a store, in which case the category should be `NULL`.
- Performance pitfalls: A performance pitfall is to use a `JOIN` clause to calculate the number of visits for each member to each store, which can be slower than using a subquery.
- Testing considerations: Testing considerations include testing the query with different inputs, such as different numbers of members and stores, and verifying that the output is correct.
