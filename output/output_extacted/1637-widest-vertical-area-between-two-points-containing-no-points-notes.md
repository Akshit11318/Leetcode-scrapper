## Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/widest-vertical-area-between-two-points-containing-no-points/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A list of `points` where each point is an array of two integers `[x, y]`.
- Constraints: `2 <= points.length <= 10^5`, `points[i].length == 2`, and `-10^6 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^6`.
- Expected output: The width of the widest vertical area between two points that does not contain any other points.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The area must be between two distinct points, and no other point can lie within this area.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each pair of distinct points, calculate the width of the area between them and check if any other point lies within this area.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all pairs of distinct points.
  2. For each pair, calculate the width of the area between them by finding the difference in their x-coordinates.
  3. Check if any other point lies within this area by iterating through all points and checking if their x-coordinates fall within the calculated range.
  4. If no other point lies within the area, update the maximum width found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by checking all possible pairs of points and verifying the condition for each pair.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    int maxWidth = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < points.size(); j++) {
            int minX = std::min(points[i][0], points[j][0]);
            int maxX = std::max(points[i][0], points[j][0]);
            bool containsOtherPoint = false;
            for (int k = 0; k < points.size(); k++) {
                if (k != i && k != j && points[k][0] > minX && points[k][0] < maxX) {
                    containsOtherPoint = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!containsOtherPoint) {
                maxWidth = std::max(maxWidth, maxX - minX);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxWidth;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of points. This is because for each pair of points (which is $O(n^2)$), we potentially check all other points.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not counting the space required for the input, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum width and temporary variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops to generate pairs of points and then check each point against these pairs, leading to high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be simplified by first sorting the points based on their x-coordinates. Then, we can iterate through the sorted points and check for each point if there's a gap between it and the next point that does not contain any other point.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the points based on their x-coordinates.
  2. Initialize the maximum width to 0.
  3. Iterate through the sorted points, and for each point, calculate the width of the area to the next point.
  4. Update the maximum width if the current width is larger.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it reduces the problem to a single pass through the sorted points, eliminating the need for nested loops and thus significantly reducing the time complexity.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    std::vector<int> xCoords;
    for (const auto& point : points) {
        xCoords.push_back(point[0]);
    }
    std::sort(xCoords.begin(), xCoords.end());
    int maxWidth = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < xCoords.size(); i++) {
        maxWidth = std::max(maxWidth, xCoords[i] - xCoords[i-1]);
    }
    return maxWidth;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting operation, where $n$ is the number of points.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the x-coordinates of the points.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to find the maximum width by leveraging the efficiency of sorting and then making a single pass through the sorted data.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, single-pass algorithms.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Simplifying problems through sorting, reducing complexity by eliminating unnecessary comparisons.
- Optimization techniques learned: Leveraging the efficiency of standard library functions for sorting, minimizing the number of iterations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as an empty input list or a list with a single point.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling duplicate x-coordinates, ensuring the solution works for points with negative x-coordinates.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient sorting algorithms or unnecessarily complex data structures.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with various inputs, including edge cases and large datasets.
