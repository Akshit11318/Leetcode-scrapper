## Minimum Number of Valid Strings to Form Target II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-valid-strings-to-form-target-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two arrays of strings `words` and a target string `target`.
- Constraints: `1 <= words.length <= 100`, `1 <= words[i].length <= 5`, `1 <= target.length <= 5`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of valid strings to form the target.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The target can be formed by concatenating any number of valid strings in any order.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - Input: `words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"], target = "cars"` 
      Output: `2`
      Explanation: We can form the target "cars" by concatenating "car" and "s", where "s" is a substring of "racecar".
    - Input: `words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"` 
      Output: `6`
      Explanation: We can form the target "aba" by concatenating "a", "b", "a", where "a" and "b" are substrings of "acca" and "bbbb" respectively.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of valid strings to form the target.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of valid strings.
  2. Check each combination to see if it forms the target.
  3. Keep track of the minimum number of valid strings needed to form the target.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that tries all possible solutions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(vector<string>& words, string target) {
        int n = words.size();
        int m = target.size();
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        
        // Function to check if a string can be formed by concatenating valid strings
        function<void(int, string)> dfs = [&](int index, string curr) {
            if (index == m) {
                ans = min(ans, (int)curr.size());
                return;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (target.substr(index, words[i].size()) == words[i]) {
                    dfs(index + words[i].size(), curr + words[i]);
                }
            }
        };
        
        dfs(0, "");
        return ans == INT_MAX ? -1 : ans;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^m \cdot n \cdot m)$, where $m$ is the length of the target and $n$ is the number of words.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the length of the target.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are trying all possible combinations of valid strings, and for each combination, we are checking if it forms the target. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the current combination of valid strings.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to store the minimum number of valid strings needed to form each prefix of the target.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the minimum number of valid strings needed to form the first `i` characters of the target.
  2. Initialize `dp[0] = 0`, because we need 0 valid strings to form an empty string.
  3. For each `i` from 1 to `m`, try all possible valid strings that end at `i`.
  4. For each valid string, update `dp[i]` if we can form the first `i` characters of the target using fewer valid strings.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we are considering all possible valid strings and storing the minimum number of valid strings needed to form each prefix of the target.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(vector<string>& words, string target) {
        int n = words.size();
        int m = target.size();
        vector<int> dp(m + 1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i >= words[j].size() && target.substr(i - words[j].size(), words[j].size()) == words[j]) {
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - words[j].size()] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m] == INT_MAX ? -1 : dp[m];
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n \cdot k)$, where $m$ is the length of the target, $n$ is the number of words, and $k$ is the maximum length of a word.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the length of the target.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we are considering all possible valid strings and storing the minimum number of valid strings needed to form each prefix of the target.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, string matching.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computation.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using dynamic programming to store the minimum number of valid strings needed to form each prefix of the target.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the Fibonacci sequence or the longest common subsequence problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the dynamic programming table correctly, not considering all possible valid strings.
- Edge cases to watch for: The target string is empty, the target string is longer than the sum of the lengths of all valid strings.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using dynamic programming to store the minimum number of valid strings needed to form each prefix of the target, resulting in redundant computation.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it is working correctly.
