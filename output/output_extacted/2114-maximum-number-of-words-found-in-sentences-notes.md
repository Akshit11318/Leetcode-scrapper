## Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-found-in-sentences/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of sentences, find the sentence with the most number of words.
- Expected output format: The sentence with the most number of words.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - Handle empty sentences or sentences with no words.
  - Handle sentences with punctuation.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so", "this is great thanks very much"]`
  - Output: `"alice and bob love leetcode"`

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Count the number of words in each sentence and keep track of the sentence with the most words.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize variables to store the sentence with the most words and the maximum word count.
  2. Iterate through each sentence in the list of sentences.
  3. For each sentence, split the sentence into words and count the number of words.
  4. If the current sentence has more words than the previous maximum, update the maximum word count and the sentence with the most words.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward solution that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mostWordsFound(vector<string>& sentences) {
        string maxWordsSentence;
        int maxWords = 0;
        for (string sentence : sentences) {
            int wordCount = 0;
            for (char c : sentence) {
                if (c == ' ') wordCount++;
            }
            wordCount++; // Count the last word
            if (wordCount > maxWords) {
                maxWords = wordCount;
                maxWordsSentence = sentence;
            }
        }
        return maxWordsSentence;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of sentences and $m$ is the maximum length of a sentence. This is because we iterate through each sentence and each character in the sentence.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not counting the space required for the input and output. This is because we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum word count and the sentence with the most words.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we iterate through each sentence and each character in the sentence. The space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum word count and the sentence with the most words.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use the `split` function or a similar method to split the sentence into words and count the number of words.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize variables to store the sentence with the most words and the maximum word count.
  2. Iterate through each sentence in the list of sentences.
  3. For each sentence, split the sentence into words and count the number of words using the `split` function or a similar method.
  4. If the current sentence has more words than the previous maximum, update the maximum word count and the sentence with the most words.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it directly addresses the problem statement and uses the most efficient method to count the number of words in each sentence.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mostWordsFound(vector<string>& sentences) {
        string maxWordsSentence;
        int maxWords = 0;
        for (string sentence : sentences) {
            int wordCount = 0;
            size_t start = 0;
            while ((start = sentence.find(' ', start)) != string::npos) {
                wordCount++;
                start++;
            }
            wordCount++; // Count the last word
            if (wordCount > maxWords) {
                maxWords = wordCount;
                maxWordsSentence = sentence;
            }
        }
        return maxWordsSentence;
    }
};
```
