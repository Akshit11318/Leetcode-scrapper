## Maximum Segment Sum After Removals
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-segment-sum-after-removals/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `nums`, an integer `removeQueries`, and a `length` of the segment.
- Constraints: `1 <= length <= nums.size()`, `1 <= removeQueries <= nums.size() - length + 1`.
- Expected Output: The maximum segment sum that can be achieved after removing `removeQueries` numbers from the array.
- Key Requirements: 
    - The removals must be done before calculating the segment sum.
    - The segment must be of `length` size.
- Edge Cases: 
    - When `removeQueries` is equal to `nums.size() - length + 1`, the maximum segment sum will be the sum of the remaining numbers in the array after removals.
    - When `removeQueries` is 0, the maximum segment sum will be the maximum sum of a subarray of size `length` in the array.
- Example Test Cases:
    - `nums = [1, 2, 5, 6, 1], removeQueries = 1, length = 3`, the maximum segment sum after removals is `12` (by removing `1` and taking the segment `[2, 5, 6]`).
    - `nums = [1, 2, 5, 6, 1], removeQueries = 2, length = 3`, the maximum segment sum after removals is `8` (by removing `1` and `1` and taking the segment `[2, 5, 1]` or `[2, 6, 1]` or `[5, 6, 1]`).

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of removing `removeQueries` numbers from the array.
- Then, for each combination, calculate the maximum segment sum of the remaining numbers.
- The maximum segment sum among all combinations is the answer.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int maximumSegmentSum(std::vector<int>& nums, int removeQueries, int length) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxSum = 0;

    // Generate all combinations of removing removeQueries numbers
    std::vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    std::function<void(int, int)> generateCombinations = [&](int start, int count) {
        if (count == removeQueries) {
            int currentSum = 0;
            // Calculate the maximum segment sum for the current combination
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
                int segmentSum = 0;
                for (int j = i; j < i + length; j++) {
                    if (!visited[j]) {
                        segmentSum += nums[j];
                    }
                }
                maxSum = std::max(maxSum, segmentSum);
            }
            return;
        }

        for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {
            visited[i] = true;
            generateCombinations(i + 1, count + 1);
            visited[i] = false;
        }
    };

    generateCombinations(0, 0);
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n \cdot length)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array `nums`. This is because we are generating all possible combinations of removing `removeQueries` numbers and calculating the maximum segment sum for each combination.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array `nums`. This is because we are using a recursive function to generate all combinations and we need to store the current combination.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are using a brute force approach to try all possible combinations of removing `removeQueries` numbers from the array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum segment sum.
- We can use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any segment.
- We can then use a sliding window of size `length` to calculate the maximum segment sum.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int maximumSegmentSum(std::vector<int>& nums, int removeQueries, int length) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + nums[i];
    }

    int maxSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
        int segmentSum = prefixSum[i + length] - prefixSum[i];
        maxSum = std::max(maxSum, segmentSum);
    }

    // Remove the smallest numbers from the array
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < removeQueries; i++) {
        nums[i] = 0;
    }

    // Calculate the maximum segment sum after removals
    maxSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
        int segmentSum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < i + length; j++) {
            segmentSum += nums[j];
        }
        maxSum = std::max(maxSum, segmentSum);
    }

    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + n \cdot length)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array `nums`. This is because we are sorting the array and then using a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum segment sum.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array `nums`. This is because we are using a prefix sum array and sorting the input array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we are using a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any segment and a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum segment sum. We are also removing the smallest numbers from the array to maximize the segment sum.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: sliding window approach, prefix sum array, sorting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any segment, using a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum segment sum.
- Optimization techniques learned: removing the smallest numbers from the array to maximize the segment sum.
- Similar problems to practice: maximum subarray sum, minimum window subarray.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not using a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any segment, not using a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum segment sum.
- Edge cases to watch for: when `removeQueries` is equal to `nums.size() - length + 1`, when `removeQueries` is 0.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach to try all possible combinations of removing `removeQueries` numbers from the array.
- Testing considerations: testing the solution with different inputs, testing the solution with edge cases.
