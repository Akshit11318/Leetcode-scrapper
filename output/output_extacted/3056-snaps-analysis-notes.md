## Snaps Analysis
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/snaps-analysis/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A table `Snaps` with columns `id`, `user_id`, `time`, and `action`.
- Constraints: The table `Snaps` contains information about user interactions with snaps.
- Expected output format: A result set containing the number of snaps for each user.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - Handle duplicate snaps.
    - Consider snaps with the same `time` and `user_id`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - A user with multiple snaps at the same time should be counted as one snap.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can iterate through each row in the table and count the number of snaps for each user.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize a dictionary to store the count of snaps for each user.
    2. Iterate through each row in the table.
    3. For each row, check if the user is already in the dictionary.
    4. If the user is already in the dictionary, increment the count.
    5. If the user is not in the dictionary, add the user to the dictionary with a count of 1.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that involves iterating through each row in the table.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

void snapsAnalysis() {
    // Initialize variables
    unordered_map<int, int> userSnaps;

    // Iterate through each row in the table
    for (auto &snap : snaps) {
        // Check if the user is already in the dictionary
        if (userSnaps.find(snap.user_id) != userSnaps.end()) {
            // Increment the count
            userSnaps[snap.user_id]++;
        } else {
            // Add the user to the dictionary with a count of 1
            userSnaps[snap.user_id] = 1;
        }
    }

    // Print the result
    for (auto &userSnap : userSnaps) {
        cout << "User ID: " << userSnap.first << ", Snaps: " << userSnap.second << endl;
    }
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of rows in the table, because we iterate through each row once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of unique users, because we store the count of snaps for each user in a dictionary.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we iterate through each row in the table, and the space complexity occurs because we store the count of snaps for each user in a dictionary.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a SQL query to count the number of snaps for each user.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Use a SQL query to count the number of snaps for each user.
    2. Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the rows by user.
    3. Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of snaps for each user.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a single SQL query to count the number of snaps for each user, which is more efficient than iterating through each row in the table.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it uses a single SQL query to count the number of snaps for each user.

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as snaps
FROM Snaps
GROUP BY user_id
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of rows in the table, because the SQL query iterates through each row once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of unique users, because the SQL query stores the count of snaps for each user in a temporary result set.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a single SQL query to count the number of snaps for each user, which is more efficient than iterating through each row in the table.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, dictionary usage, and SQL queries.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a SQL query to count the number of snaps for each user.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a single SQL query to count the number of snaps for each user.
- Similar problems to practice: Counting the number of occurrences of each element in a list.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking if a user is already in the dictionary before incrementing the count.
- Edge cases to watch for: Duplicate snaps and snaps with the same `time` and `user_id`.
- Performance pitfalls: Iterating through each row in the table multiple times.
- Testing considerations: Testing the SQL query with different inputs and edge cases.
