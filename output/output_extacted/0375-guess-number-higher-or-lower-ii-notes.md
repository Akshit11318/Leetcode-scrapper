## Guess Number Higher or Lower II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `n`, representing the maximum possible number that can be guessed.
- Output: The minimum cost to guess the number in the worst-case scenario.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The minimum cost should be calculated considering all possible numbers from 1 to `n`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `n = 1`, the minimum cost is 0, as there is only one possible number.
  - For `n = 2`, the minimum cost is 1, as we can guess the number in one attempt.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can start by trying all possible numbers from 1 to `n` and calculate the cost for each number.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `min_cost` to store the minimum cost.
  2. Iterate over all possible numbers from 1 to `n`.
  3. For each number, calculate the cost by guessing the number and updating the `min_cost` if necessary.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach to try all possible numbers and calculate the cost for each number.

```cpp
int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
    int min_cost = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int cost = 0;
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (mid == i) {
                cost += mid;
                break;
            } else if (mid < i) {
                cost += mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                cost += mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        min_cost = max(min_cost, cost);
    }
    return min_cost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because we have a nested loop that iterates over all possible numbers from 1 to `n`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `min_cost` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we have a nested loop, and the space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to store the minimum cost for each subproblem and avoid redundant calculations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the minimum cost for each subproblem.
  2. Iterate over all possible subproblems and calculate the minimum cost using dynamic programming.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach ensures that we calculate the minimum cost for each subproblem only once, resulting in an optimal solution.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n - len + 1; i++) {
            int j = i + len - 1;
            dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
            for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                int cost = k + max((k - 1 >= i) ? dp[i][k - 1] : 0, (k + 1 <= j) ? dp[k + 1][j] : 0);
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], cost);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[1][n];
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, memoization, and optimization.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and optimize the solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using memoization to store the minimum cost for each subproblem and avoid redundant calculations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the `0/1 Knapsack Problem` and the `Longest Common Subsequence Problem`.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the `dp` array correctly, not using memoization correctly, and not handling edge cases correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling the case where `n` is 1, and handling the case where `n` is 2.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using dynamic programming, not using memoization, and not optimizing the solution correctly.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different inputs, including edge cases, and testing the solution with large inputs to ensure that it scales correctly.
