## Minimize Product Sum of Two Arrays
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-product-sum-of-two-arrays/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively.
- Constraints: $1 \leq m \leq n \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq nums1[i], nums2[i] \leq 10^5$.
- Expected Output: The minimum product sum of two arrays, which is achieved by pairing the `i-th` smallest element of `nums1` with the `i-th` largest element of `nums2`, and summing these products.
- Key Requirements: Find a way to efficiently sort both arrays and then pair elements from `nums1` with elements from `nums2` to minimize the product sum.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Sort both arrays and then pair the smallest element from `nums1` with the largest element from `nums2`, the next smallest from `nums1` with the next largest from `nums2`, and so on.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Sort `nums1` in ascending order.
  2. Sort `nums2` in descending order.
  3. Initialize a variable `productSum` to 0.
  4. Iterate through both sorted arrays simultaneously, multiplying corresponding elements and adding the product to `productSum`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the requirement to minimize the product sum by ensuring that the smallest numbers are multiplied by the largest numbers.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>

int minProductSum(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    // Sort nums1 in ascending order
    sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    
    // Sort nums2 in descending order
    sort(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());
    
    int productSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
        // For each pair, multiply the elements and add to productSum
        productSum += nums1[i] * nums2[i];
    }
    
    return productSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \log m + n \log n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. This is due to the sorting operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ if we consider the sorting to be done in-place, otherwise $O(m + n)$ for sorting algorithms that require extra space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operations, which are necessary to pair the elements correctly. The space complexity depends on the sorting algorithm used.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The same approach as the brute force is actually optimal because it directly addresses the problem's requirement. There's no need for a more complex algorithm since sorting and pairing are sufficient.
- Detailed breakdown: The explanation is the same as the brute force approach since it's already optimal.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures the smallest numbers in `nums1` are multiplied by the largest numbers in `nums2`, which is the definition of minimizing the product sum.

```cpp
// The code remains the same as the brute force approach
int minProductSum(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    sort(nums2.rbegin(), nums2.rend()); // Use reverse iterators for descending order
    int productSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
        productSum += nums1[i] * nums2[i];
    }
    return productSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \log m + n \log n)$
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ for in-place sorting
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most straightforward and efficient way to minimize the product sum, as it directly implements the problem's definition without any unnecessary steps or complexity.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Sorting is a fundamental operation in many algorithms.
- Understanding the problem's constraints and requirements is key to finding an optimal solution.
- Sometimes, the brute force approach can be optimal if it directly addresses the problem's needs.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the problem's constraints and how they impact the solution.
- Overcomplicating the solution by introducing unnecessary complexity.
- Not validating the input or handling edge cases properly.

This problem demonstrates the importance of understanding the problem statement and applying the most straightforward yet efficient solution. The optimal approach directly addresses the requirement to minimize the product sum by sorting and pairing elements from the two arrays, making it both efficient and easy to implement.
