## Beautiful Towers I
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-towers-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of integers `heights` representing the heights of towers, where `heights[i]` is the height of the `i-th` tower.
- Expected output format: The number of beautiful towers.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: A tower is beautiful if its height is greater than or equal to the height of the tower to its left and less than or equal to the height of the tower to its right.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `heights = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]`: The beautiful towers are the towers with heights 3, 4, and 5.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check every tower to see if it is beautiful by comparing its height with the heights of the towers to its left and right.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate through the list of tower heights.
  2. For each tower, check if it is beautiful by comparing its height with the heights of the towers to its left and right.
  3. Count the number of beautiful towers.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach that checks every tower individually.

```cpp
int beautifulTowers(vector<int>& heights) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < heights.size(); i++) {
        bool isBeautiful = true;
        if (i > 0 && heights[i] < heights[i - 1]) {
            isBeautiful = false;
        }
        if (i < heights.size() - 1 && heights[i] > heights[i + 1]) {
            isBeautiful = false;
        }
        if (isBeautiful) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of towers, because we iterate through the list of tower heights once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the count of beautiful towers.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we check every tower once, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the count.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal because we must check every tower to determine if it is beautiful.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The same as the brute force approach.
- Proof of optimality: We must check every tower to determine if it is beautiful, so the time complexity cannot be improved.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The time complexity is already linear, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
int beautifulTowers(vector<int>& heights) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < heights.size(); i++) {
        bool isBeautiful = true;
        if (i > 0 && heights[i] < heights[i - 1]) {
            isBeautiful = false;
        }
        if (i < heights.size() - 1 && heights[i] > heights[i + 1]) {
            isBeautiful = false;
        }
        if (isBeautiful) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional statements, and counting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking every element in a list to determine if it meets a certain condition.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the brute force approach is already optimal.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve checking every element in a list to determine if it meets a certain condition.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Off-by-one errors when checking the boundaries of the list.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where the list is empty, and the case where the list has only one element.
- Performance pitfalls: None, because the time complexity is already optimal.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with lists of different lengths and with different combinations of tower heights.
