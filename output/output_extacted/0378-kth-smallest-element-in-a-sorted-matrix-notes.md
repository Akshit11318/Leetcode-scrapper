## Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A sorted `n x n` matrix and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 30`, `1 <= k <= n^2`.
- Expected output: The `k`th smallest element in the matrix.
- Key requirements: The input matrix is sorted in ascending order from left to right and top to bottom.
- Example test cases: 
    - Input: `matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8`
    - Output: `13`
    - Explanation: The elements in the matrix in ascending order are `[1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15]`, and the `8`th smallest element is `13`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One straightforward way to find the `k`th smallest element is to flatten the matrix into a single array and then sort this array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize an empty vector to store the elements of the matrix.
    2. Iterate over each row of the matrix and append its elements to the vector.
    3. Sort the vector in ascending order.
    4. Return the `k-1`th element of the sorted vector (since indices start at 0).
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the requirement of finding the `k`th smallest element without considering the sorted nature of the matrix.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        vector<int> nums;
        for (auto& row : matrix) {
            for (int num : row) {
                nums.push_back(num);
            }
        }
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        return nums[k - 1];
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \log(n^2))$ due to the sorting of the flattened matrix, where $n$ is the size of the matrix.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ for storing the flattened matrix.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves sorting all elements of the matrix, leading to the time complexity. The space complexity arises from storing all elements in a new data structure.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Utilize a min-heap data structure to efficiently find the `k`th smallest element without sorting the entire matrix.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Initialize a min-heap with the first element of each row in the matrix, along with its row and column index.
    2. Remove the smallest element from the heap `k` times, and each time, add the next element from the same row to the heap if it exists.
    3. The `k`th removed element is the `k`th smallest element in the matrix.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that we only consider the smallest elements at each step, reducing unnecessary comparisons and achieving a better time complexity than the brute force approach.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            minHeap.push(matrix[i][0]);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            int val = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[j][0] == val) {
                    if (j + 1 < n) {
                        minHeap.push(matrix[j][j + 1]);
                        matrix[j][0] = INT_MAX; // Mark as visited
                    }
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minHeap.top();
    }
};
```

However, the optimal solution involves a more sophisticated approach that doesn't require pushing elements from the matrix into the heap in a way that considers the structure of the matrix more directly:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        priority_queue<tuple<int, int, int>, vector<tuple<int, int, int>>, greater<tuple<int, int, int>>> minHeap;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            minHeap.emplace(matrix[0][i], 0, i);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            auto [val, row, col] = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            if (row + 1 < n) {
                minHeap.emplace(matrix[row + 1][col], row + 1, col);
            }
        }
        
        return get<0>(minHeap.top());
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \log(n))$, where $n$ is the size of the matrix. This is because we perform a heap operation $k$ times, and each heap operation takes $O(\log(n))$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the elements in the min-heap.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it leverages the structure of the matrix and the properties of the min-heap to find the $k$th smallest element in the most efficient manner possible, avoiding unnecessary comparisons and minimizing the number of elements that need to be stored and processed.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of leveraging the structure of the input data (in this case, the sorted matrix) to optimize the solution.
- The utility of min-heap data structures in finding the smallest elements in a dataset.
- The trade-off between time and space complexity in algorithm design.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Failing to consider the sorted nature of the input matrix, leading to inefficient solutions.
- Incorrectly implementing the min-heap operations, which can lead to incorrect results or performance issues.
- Not optimizing the solution for the specific constraints of the problem, potentially resulting in inefficient use of resources.
