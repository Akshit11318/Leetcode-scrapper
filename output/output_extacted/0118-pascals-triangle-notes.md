## Pascal's Triangle

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an integer `numRows` as input, representing the number of rows in Pascal's triangle to generate. The input is constrained to `1 <= numRows <= 30`.
- Expected output format: The function should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in Pascal's triangle.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The first and last elements of each row are always `1`, and the sum of the two elements directly above a given element is equal to the value of that element.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `numRows = 5`, the output should be `[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]`.
  - For `numRows = 1`, the output should be `[[1]]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One might start by manually calculating the values for each row based on the properties of Pascal's triangle, where each element is the sum of the two directly above it.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize the first row as `[1]`.
  2. For each subsequent row, start and end with `1`.
  3. For the middle elements, calculate the value as the sum of the two elements directly above it from the previous row.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly implements the mathematical definition of Pascal's triangle, making it intuitive but potentially inefficient for large inputs.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
    vector<vector<int>> triangle;
    triangle.push_back({1});
    for (int i = 1; i < numRows; i++) {
        vector<int> row = {1};
        vector<int> prevRow = triangle[i - 1];
        for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
            row.push_back(prevRow[j - 1] + prevRow[j]);
        }
        row.push_back(1);
        triangle.push_back(row);
    }
    return triangle;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of rows. This is because for each row, we potentially calculate up to $n-1$ elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, as we store all elements of the triangle. In the worst case, the number of elements stored is the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers, which simplifies to $O(n^2)$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity arises from the nested loop structure, where the outer loop runs $n$ times and the inner loop runs up to $n-1$ times. The space complexity comes from storing all elements of the triangle.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Recognizing that each row in Pascal's triangle can be generated using the properties of binomial coefficients, specifically that the $k^{th}$ element in the $n^{th}$ row is given by the formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the result with the first row `[1]`.
  2. For each subsequent row up to `numRows`, calculate each element using the formula $\binom{n}{k}$.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates each element without unnecessary computations, leveraging the mathematical properties of Pascal's triangle.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The nature of the problem requires calculating each element, and the formula used is the most direct method to do so.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
    vector<vector<int>> triangle;
    for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
        vector<int> row;
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            if (j == 0 || j == i) {
                row.push_back(1);
            } else {
                row.push_back(triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]);
            }
        }
        triangle.push_back(row);
    }
    return triangle;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of rows. Each element in the triangle is calculated once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, as all elements of the triangle are stored.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because we must calculate each element at least once. The space complexity is also optimal since we must store all elements to return the result.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming and the use of mathematical formulas to optimize calculations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Recognizing patterns in sequences and applying mathematical principles to simplify computations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using formulas to directly calculate values instead of relying on iterative methods.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving sequences and series, such as Fibonacci numbers or calculating binomial coefficients.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to handle edge cases, such as the first and last row, or incorrectly calculating the middle elements.
- Edge cases to watch for: The first and last elements of each row are always `1`, and the input `numRows` must be handled correctly.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms that result in higher than necessary time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Ensure that the solution works correctly for the minimum and maximum input values, as well as average cases.
