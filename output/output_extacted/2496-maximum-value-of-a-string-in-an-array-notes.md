## Maximum Value of a String in an Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-of-a-string-in-an-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a list of strings `words` and a string `s`, find the maximum value of a string in `words` based on the frequency of characters in `s`. Each character in `s` has a frequency score, and the value of a string in `words` is calculated as the sum of the frequency scores of its characters.
- Expected output format: Return the maximum value of a string in `words`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where `words` or `s` is empty, and ensure the function is case-sensitive.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `words = ["hello", "world"], s = "hello world"`: The function should return the maximum value based on the frequency of characters in `s`.
  - `words = ["aaa", "bbb", "ccc"], s = "aaa bbb ccc"`: The function should return the maximum value based on the frequency of characters in `s`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the frequency of each character in `s` and then iterate over each string in `words` to calculate its value based on the frequency of its characters.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a frequency map of characters in `s`.
  2. Iterate over each string in `words`.
  3. For each string, calculate its value by summing the frequency scores of its characters.
  4. Keep track of the maximum value encountered.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by calculating the frequency of characters in `s` and then using this frequency map to evaluate the value of each string in `words`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

int maximumValue(std::vector<std::string>& words, std::string s) {
    // Create a frequency map of characters in s
    std::unordered_map<char, int> freqMap;
    for (char c : s) {
        if (freqMap.find(c) != freqMap.end()) {
            freqMap[c]++;
        } else {
            freqMap[c] = 1;
        }
    }

    int maxValue = 0;
    // Iterate over each string in words
    for (const std::string& word : words) {
        int wordValue = 0;
        // Calculate the value of the current string
        for (char c : word) {
            if (freqMap.find(c) != freqMap.end()) {
                wordValue += freqMap[c];
            }
        }
        // Update the maximum value
        maxValue = std::max(maxValue, wordValue);
    }

    return maxValue;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m + k)$, where $n$ is the number of strings in `words`, $m$ is the maximum length of a string in `words`, and $k$ is the length of string `s`. This is because we first iterate over `s` to create the frequency map, and then we iterate over each string in `words` to calculate its value.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, as in the worst case, the frequency map will contain an entry for each unique character in `s`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the iteration over `s` to create the frequency map and the iteration over each string in `words`. The space complexity is determined by the size of the frequency map.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The same approach as the brute force is already optimal because it involves a single pass over `s` to create the frequency map and then a single pass over each string in `words` to calculate its value. There are no unnecessary operations or data structures used that could be optimized further.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: The optimal approach remains the same as the brute force approach because it is already efficient and directly addresses the problem statement.
- Proof of optimality: The time complexity of $O(n \cdot m + k)$ is optimal because we must at least read the input strings once to calculate their values. The space complexity of $O(k)$ is also optimal because we need to store the frequency of characters in `s` to calculate the values of strings in `words`.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is not possible because the current approach already has the minimum required time and space complexity to solve the problem.

```cpp
// The code remains the same as in the brute force approach
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m + k)$
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$
> - **Optimality proof:** The approach is optimal because it involves the minimum necessary operations to solve the problem, and no further reduction in time or space complexity is achievable without altering the problem's constraints.
