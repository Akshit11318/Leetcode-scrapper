## Palindrome Removal

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-removal/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: a list of integers `nums` and a target integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`, `1 <= k <= 10^5`.
- Expected output: the minimum number of operations to remove all occurrences of `k` from `nums`, considering that an operation can remove either a single element or a palindrome with at least one occurrence of `k`.
- Key requirements: consider all possible operations to minimize the count of operations.
- Example test cases:
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3`, the answer is `1` because we can remove the palindrome `[2, 3, 4]` in one operation.
  - `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], k = 3`, the answer is `2` because we can remove the palindrome `[2, 2]` and then the palindrome `[3, 4, 4]` in two operations.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves considering all possible subsequences of `nums` that contain `k`.
- We then determine which of these subsequences are palindromes or single elements.
- For each subsequence that is a palindrome or a single element containing `k`, we consider removing it as an operation.
- We aim to minimize the total count of such operations.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int operations = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] == k) {
            operations++;
            // Attempt to find a palindrome centered around i
            for (int j = 0; i - j >= 0 && i + j < n; ++j) {
                if (nums[i - j] != nums[i + j]) break;
                // Found a palindrome, remove it
                if (j > 0) {
                    operations--;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return operations;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the size of `nums`. This is because for each element, we potentially scan the entire array to find palindromes.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops to find palindromes, leading to quadratic time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use dynamic programming to track the minimum operations required up to each position in the array.
- We maintain two arrays: `dp` to track the minimum operations if we remove the current element (or the palindrome it's part of) and `extend` to track if we can extend a palindrome from a previous position to the current one.
- We iterate through `nums`, updating `dp` and `extend` based on whether the current element is `k` and whether it can be part of a palindrome.

```cpp
#include <vector>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
    std::vector<bool> extend(n + 1, false);
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i - 1] == k) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
            extend[i] = true;
        } else {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
            extend[i] = false;
        }
        
        // Check for palindrome opportunities
        for (int j = 1; i - j >= 0; ++j) {
            if (nums[i - 1] == nums[i - j - 1] && (j == 1 || extend[i - j - 1])) {
                if (nums[i - 1] == k || nums[i - j - 1] == k) {
                    dp[i] = std::min(dp[i], dp[i - j - 1] + 1);
                } else {
                    dp[i] = std::min(dp[i], dp[i - j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the size of `nums`. This is because we potentially compare each element with every previous element to find palindromes.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we use dynamic programming arrays of size $n + 1$.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it considers all possible palindromes and single elements that can be removed in one operation, ensuring the minimum count of operations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The problem demonstrates the use of dynamic programming to solve complex optimization problems.
- It highlights the importance of considering all possible operations (in this case, removing palindromes or single elements) to minimize the total count.
- The optimal solution shows how to efficiently track and update the minimum operations required as we iterate through the input array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering all possible palindromes that can be removed in one operation.
- Failing to update the dynamic programming state correctly based on the current element and its potential to be part of a palindrome.
- Not optimizing the solution to minimize unnecessary computations and comparisons.
