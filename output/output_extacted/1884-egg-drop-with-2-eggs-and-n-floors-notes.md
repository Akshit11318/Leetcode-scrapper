## Egg Drop with 2 Eggs and N Floors

**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/egg-drop-with-2-eggs-and-n-floors/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/egg-drop-with-2-eggs-and-n-floors/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer `n` representing the number of floors.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of moves required to determine the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The optimal approach should consider the worst-case scenario for each possible move.
  - Edge cases include `n = 1` (only one floor to check) and `n = 2` (two floors to check).
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `n = 1`, the minimum number of moves is `1` (check the only floor).
  - For `n = 2`, the minimum number of moves is `2` (check each floor individually).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of drops to find the minimum number of moves.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Start from the first floor.
  2. Try dropping the egg from each floor.
  3. If the egg breaks, start from the first floor again with the remaining egg.
  4. If the egg doesn't break, move to the next floor and repeat steps 2-3.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive approach that considers all possibilities.

```cpp
int twoEggDropBruteForce(int n) {
    int minMoves = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int moves = 0;
        for (int j = i; j <= n; j += i) {
            moves++;
            if (j == n) break;
        }
        minMoves = min(minMoves, moves);
    }
    return minMoves;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, because for each floor, we potentially check every other floor.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops over the floors, leading to quadratic time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a mathematical formula to calculate the minimum number of moves required.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. The minimum number of moves can be calculated using the formula $\lceil \log_2{n} \rceil$.
  2. This formula is derived from the fact that with two eggs, we can divide the search space in half with each move.
- Proof of optimality: The formula represents the minimum number of moves required to find the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking, given that we have two eggs.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach already considers the optimal strategy for using two eggs.

```cpp
int twoEggDropOptimal(int n) {
    return (int)ceil((double)log(n) / log(2));
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only perform a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The formula represents the minimum number of moves required to find the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking, given that we have two eggs.
