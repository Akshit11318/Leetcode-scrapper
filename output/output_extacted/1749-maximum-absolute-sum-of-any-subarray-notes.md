## Maximum Absolute Sum of Any Subarray
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-absolute-sum-of-any-subarray/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an array of integers, and the task is to find the maximum absolute sum of any subarray within this array.
- Expected output format: The output should be the maximum absolute sum.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The array can contain both positive and negative integers, and the maximum absolute sum can be achieved by either a subarray with all positive elements or a subarray with all negative elements.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
  - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output should be `10` because the subarray `[1, 2, 3, 4]` has an absolute sum of `10`.
  - For the input `[-1, -2, -3, -4]`, the output should be `10` because the subarray `[-1, -2, -3, -4]` has an absolute sum of `10`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to calculate the sum of every possible subarray and keep track of the maximum absolute sum found.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize a variable `maxSum` to negative infinity.
  2. Iterate over the array to generate all possible subarrays.
  3. For each subarray, calculate its sum.
  4. Update `maxSum` if the absolute sum of the current subarray is greater.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward, exhaustive approach that considers all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int maxAbsoluteSum(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                sum += nums[k];
            }
            maxSum = std::max(maxSum, std::abs(sum));
        }
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is because for each element (first loop), we potentially generate all subarrays starting from that element (second loop), and for each subarray, we sum its elements (third loop).
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input and output, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the `maxSum` variable and loop counters.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inherently inefficient due to its exhaustive nature, leading to high time complexity. However, it uses minimal extra space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The maximum absolute sum of any subarray can be found by maintaining a running sum and updating the maximum absolute sum whenever a new subarray is considered.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize `maxSum` to the first element of the array (or 0 if the array is empty).
  2. Initialize `currentSum` to the first element.
  3. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
  4. For each element, update `currentSum` to be the maximum of the current element and the sum of `currentSum` and the current element. This effectively decides whether to start a new subarray or extend the existing one.
  5. Update `maxSum` if the absolute value of `currentSum` is greater.
- Proof of optimality: This approach considers all possible subarrays efficiently by maintaining a running sum, and it does so in a single pass through the array, leading to a significant reduction in time complexity compared to the brute force approach.

```cpp
int maxAbsoluteSum(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return 0;
    int maxSum = std::abs(nums[0]);
    int currentSum = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        currentSum = std::max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);
        maxSum = std::max(maxSum, std::abs(currentSum));
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we make a single pass through the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input and output, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the `maxSum`, `currentSum`, and loop counters.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it achieves the best possible time complexity for this problem, considering that we must at least examine each element once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The importance of maintaining a running sum and making decisions based on whether to extend or start a new subarray.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The use of dynamic programming principles to efficiently solve problems that have overlapping subproblems.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations and using a single pass through the data.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving subarrays, such as finding the maximum sum of a subarray or the longest increasing subsequence.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly updating the running sum or maximum sum.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling empty arrays or arrays with a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms that result in high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with various inputs, including edge cases.
