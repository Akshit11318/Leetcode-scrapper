## Calculate Digit Sum of a String
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-digit-sum-of-a-string/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` containing only digits and the character '#', and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq s.length \leq 10^4$, $1 \leq k \leq 10^4$, and `s` contains only digits and the character '#'.
- Expected output: The digit sum of the resulting string after `k` operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - The string `s` can be very large.
    - The integer `k` can be very large.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - For `s = "1111122222333334444455555"` and `k = 4`, the output should be `30`.
    - For `s = "00000000"` and `k = 1`, the output should be `0`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One way to solve this problem is to simulate the process `k` times.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize a variable `result` to store the resulting string.
    2. Initialize a variable `current` to store the current string.
    3. Set `current` to `s`.
    4. For `k` times:
        - For each character in `current`, calculate the sum of digits and append the sum to `result`.
        - Update `current` to `result`.
        - Reset `result`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement.

```cpp
int digitSum(string s, int k) {
    while (k--) {
        string result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            while (i < s.size() && s[i] != '#') {
                sum += s[i] - '0';
                i++;
            }
            result += to_string(sum);
        }
        s = result;
    }
    int sum = 0;
    for (char c : s) {
        sum += c - '0';
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times k)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are simulating the process `k` times, and each time we are iterating over the string `s`. The space complexity occurs because we are storing the resulting string in `result`.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved by observing the pattern that the digit sum of the resulting string after `k` operations will be the same as the digit sum of the original string.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Calculate the digit sum of the original string.
    2. Return the digit sum.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the string, and it does not require any extra space.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it only requires a single pass over the string, and it does not require any extra space.

```cpp
int digitSum(string s, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c != '#') {
            sum += c - '0';
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the length of the string `s`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the string, and it does not require any extra space.

- Similar problems to practice: Similar problems to practice include problems that require observing patterns and using them to optimize the solution.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: A common implementation error is to simulate the process `k` times, which can lead to a time complexity of $O(n \times k)$.
- Edge cases to watch for: An edge case to watch for is when the string `s` is empty or when `k` is 0.
- Performance pitfalls: A performance pitfall is to use a brute force approach, which can lead to a time complexity of $O(n \times k)$.
- Testing considerations: A testing consideration is to test the solution with different inputs, including edge cases.
