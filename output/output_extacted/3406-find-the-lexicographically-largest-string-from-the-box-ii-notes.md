## Find the Lexicographically Largest String from the Box II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-lexicographically-largest-string-from-the-box-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Given a list of strings `box` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: Each string in `box` has the same length.
- Expected output format: Return the lexicographically largest string from `box` after performing `k` operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Each operation involves removing a string from `box`, appending it to the end of another string in `box`, and then adding the new string back into `box`.
  - We need to find the lexicographically largest string after `k` such operations.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `box = ["abc","bca","acb"]` and `k = 2`, one possible sequence of operations is to append "bca" to "abc" to get "abc" + "bca" = "abcbca", and then append "acb" to "abcbca" to get "abcbca" + "acb" = "abcbcacb". The lexicographically largest string after 2 operations is "abcbcacb".

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of string concatenations for `k` operations and keep track of the lexicographically largest string found.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of strings in `box`.
  2. For each permutation, perform `k` operations of string concatenation, trying all possible pairs of strings for each operation.
  3. After `k` operations, compare the resulting string with the current lexicographically largest string found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach to ensure that all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

string lexicographicallyLargestString(vector<string>& box, int k) {
    // Base case
    if (k == 0) {
        string maxStr = *max_element(box.begin(), box.end());
        return maxStr;
    }

    string maxStr = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < box.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < box.size(); j++) {
            if (i != j) {
                vector<string> newBox = box;
                newBox.erase(newBox.begin() + j);
                string newStr = box[i] + box[j];
                newBox.push_back(newStr);
                string result = lexicographicallyLargestString(newBox, k - 1);
                if (result > maxStr) {
                    maxStr = result;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return maxStr;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^{k+1} \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings in `box` and $m$ is the average length of a string in `box`. This is because for each of the $n$ strings, we try to append it to every other string, leading to $n$ choices for each of the $k$ operations, and we compare strings of length up to $m \cdot (k+1)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, for storing the modified `box` at each recursive step.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The recursive nature of trying all combinations and the string comparisons lead to these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The lexicographically largest string after `k` operations will be the one that starts with the lexicographically largest prefix and has the maximum length.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort `box` in descending lexicographical order.
  2. Select the first string (which is the lexicographically largest) and concatenate it with the next `k` strings in the sorted list.
  3. The resulting string is the lexicographically largest possible after `k` operations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

string lexicographicallyLargestString(vector<string>& box, int k) {
    sort(box.rbegin(), box.rend());
    string result = box[0];
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        result += box[i % box.size()];
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + k \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings in `box` and $m$ is the average length of a string in `box`. The sorting step dominates with $O(n \log n)$, and then we have a linear concatenation step.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, for storing the sorted `box` and the resulting string.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly constructs the lexicographically largest string by starting with the lexicographically largest string and then appending the next `k` lexicographically largest strings, ensuring the maximum possible lexicographical order after `k` operations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, string concatenation, and understanding of lexicographical order.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Starting with a brute force approach and then optimizing based on insights into the problem's structure.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using sorting to efficiently find the lexicographically largest string and reducing the number of operations by directly constructing the optimal solution.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling edge cases such as an empty `box` or `k` being larger than the number of strings in `box`.
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring that the input `box` and `k` are valid and that the operations are correctly performed.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms that lead to high time complexities, such as the brute force approach for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness and performance.
