## First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/first-day-where-you-have-been-in-all-the-rooms/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an integer `n` and a 2D array `nextRooms` where `nextRooms[i] = [nextRoom_i, time_i]`, find the first day where you have been in all the rooms.
- Expected output format: Return the first day where you have been in all the rooms.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    * `1 <= n <= 10^5`
    * `1 <= nextRooms.length <= 10^5`
    * `nextRooms[i].length == 2`
    * `0 <= nextRoom_i <= n-1`
    * `0 <= time_i <= 10^5`
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    * `n = 2`, `nextRooms = [[0, 1], [1, 1]]`, Output: `2`
    * `n = 3`, `nextRooms = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1]]`, Output: `6`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Start at room 0 and traverse the rooms based on the given `nextRooms`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize a queue with room 0 and day 0.
    2. Initialize a set to keep track of visited rooms.
    3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum day.
    4. While the queue is not empty, pop the room and day from the queue.
    5. For each next room and time, push the next room and day + time into the queue.
    6. If the next room has not been visited before, add it to the set of visited rooms and update the maximum day.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This is a straightforward approach that follows the given instructions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int firstDayWhereYouHaveBeenInAllTheRooms(int n, vector<vector<int>>& nextRooms) {
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    q.push({0, 0});
    set<int> visited;
    int maxDay = 0;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int room = q.front().first;
        int day = q.front().second;
        q.pop();
        if (visited.find(room) == visited.end()) {
            visited.insert(room);
            maxDay = max(maxDay, day);
            for (auto& nextRoom : nextRooms) {
                if (nextRoom[0] == room) {
                    q.push({nextRoom[1], day + nextRoom[1] + 1});
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return maxDay;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of rooms and $m$ is the number of next rooms. This is because we are traversing the `nextRooms` array for each room.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of rooms and $m$ is the number of next rooms. This is because we are using a queue and a set to keep track of visited rooms.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are traversing the `nextRooms` array for each room and using a queue and a set to keep track of visited rooms.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a more efficient data structure, such as a graph, to represent the rooms and their connections.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Create a graph where each room is a node and the connections between rooms are edges.
    2. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the graph and keep track of the day.
    3. Use a set to keep track of visited rooms.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a more efficient data structure and algorithm to traverse the rooms.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it uses the most efficient data structure and algorithm for this problem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int firstDayWhereYouHaveBeenInAllTheRooms(int n, vector<vector<int>>& nextRooms) {
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < nextRooms.size(); i++) {
        graph[nextRooms[i][0]].push_back({nextRooms[i][1], nextRooms[i][2]});
    }
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    q.push({0, 0});
    set<int> visited;
    int maxDay = 0;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int room = q.front().first;
        int day = q.front().second;
        q.pop();
        if (visited.find(room) == visited.end()) {
            visited.insert(room);
            maxDay = max(maxDay, day);
            for (auto& nextRoom : graph[room]) {
                q.push({nextRoom.first, day + nextRoom.second + 1});
            }
        }
    }
    return maxDay;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of rooms and $m$ is the number of next rooms. This is because we are traversing the graph using BFS.
