## Restaurant Growth
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/restaurant-growth/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input will be an array of integers representing the satisfaction values of customers.
- Expected output format: The output should be an integer representing the maximum satisfaction that can be achieved.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The growth rate is 1 for the first day, and it doubles for each subsequent day. The satisfaction values can be negative, zero, or positive. The number of customers is at least 1.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For input [4, 3, 2, 1], the output should be 10 because the maximum satisfaction is achieved when the growth rate is applied to the largest satisfaction values first.
    - For input [-1, -8, 0, 2, -7, -4, -2, 9, 4, 7, 3, 1, 10, -5, 7, 4, 3], the output should be 16.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To solve this problem, we can try all possible combinations of applying the growth rate to the satisfaction values.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
    1. Generate all permutations of the satisfaction values.
    2. For each permutation, calculate the total satisfaction by applying the growth rate to each value.
    3. Keep track of the maximum satisfaction achieved.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and ensures that we consider all possible scenarios.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int maxSatisfaction(std::vector<int>& satisfaction) {
    int n = satisfaction.size();
    int maxSatisfaction = INT_MIN;
    
    // Generate all permutations
    std::sort(satisfaction.begin(), satisfaction.end(), std::greater<int>());
    
    do {
        int currentSatisfaction = 0;
        int growthRate = 1;
        
        // Calculate the total satisfaction for the current permutation
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            currentSatisfaction += growthRate * satisfaction[i];
            growthRate *= 2;
        }
        
        // Update the maximum satisfaction
        maxSatisfaction = std::max(maxSatisfaction, currentSatisfaction);
    } while (std::next_permutation(satisfaction.begin(), satisfaction.end()));
    
    return maxSatisfaction;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n! \cdot n)$ because we generate all permutations of the satisfaction values and calculate the total satisfaction for each permutation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum satisfaction and the current permutation.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we try all possible combinations of satisfaction values, and the space complexity is low because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The growth rate doubles for each day, so we should apply the growth rate to the largest satisfaction values first to maximize the total satisfaction.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
    1. Sort the satisfaction values in descending order.
    2. Initialize the total satisfaction and the growth rate.
    3. Iterate over the sorted satisfaction values and calculate the total satisfaction by applying the growth rate to each value.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures that the growth rate is applied to the largest satisfaction values first, maximizing the total satisfaction.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int maxSatisfaction(std::vector<int>& satisfaction) {
    int n = satisfaction.size();
    int maxSatisfaction = 0;
    int growthRate = 1;
    
    // Sort the satisfaction values in descending order
    std::sort(satisfaction.begin(), satisfaction.end(), std::greater<int>());
    
    // Calculate the total satisfaction
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        maxSatisfaction += growthRate * satisfaction[i];
        growthRate *= 2;
    }
    
    return maxSatisfaction;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ because we sort the satisfaction values and then calculate the total satisfaction.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum satisfaction and the growth rate.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it ensures that the growth rate is applied to the largest satisfaction values first, maximizing the total satisfaction.
