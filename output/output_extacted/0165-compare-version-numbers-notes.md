## Compare Version Numbers

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two version numbers (`version1` and `version2`) as strings.
- Constraints: Version numbers are non-empty strings of digits separated by dots, e.g., "0.0.1" or "1.0.0".
- Expected Output: An integer indicating whether `version1` is less than (`-1`), equal to (`0`), or greater than (`1`) `version2`.
- Key Requirements:
  - Compare versions based on their numerical values, ignoring leading zeros.
  - Handle versions of different lengths by considering missing parts as zeros.
- Edge Cases:
  - Versions with leading zeros, e.g., "01.1" vs. "1.1".
  - Versions of different lengths, e.g., "1.1" vs. "1.1.0".
- Example Test Cases:
  - "0.1" vs. "1.1" should return `-1`.
  - "1.0.1" vs. "1" should return `1`.
  - "7.5.2.4" vs. "7.5.3" should return `-1`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought might be to compare the versions character by character, considering each dot as a separator for version parts.
- This approach involves splitting the version strings into parts, converting each part to an integer (ignoring leading zeros), and then comparing these integers part by part.
- However, this approach quickly becomes cumbersome due to the need to handle versions of different lengths and to ignore leading zeros.

```cpp
int compareVersion(string version1, string version2) {
    // Split the version strings into parts
    istringstream iss1(version1), iss2(version2);
    string part1, part2;
    while (getline(iss1, part1, '.') || getline(iss2, part2, '.')) {
        // Convert each part to an integer, ignoring leading zeros
        int num1 = part1.empty() ? 0 : stoi(part1);
        int num2 = part2.empty() ? 0 : stoi(part2);
        
        // Compare the integers
        if (num1 < num2) return -1;
        else if (num1 > num2) return 1;
    }
    // If all parts are equal, the versions are equal
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the total number of parts in `version1` and `version2`, respectively. This is because in the worst case, we might need to split and compare every part of both versions.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, for storing the parts of the versions.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The splitting and comparison of each part contribute to the time complexity. The space complexity is due to the storage of version parts.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- A more efficient approach involves using two pointers to iterate through both version strings simultaneously, parsing the version parts as we go.
- This method avoids the need for explicit splitting and storage of version parts, reducing memory usage.
- By comparing the version parts as soon as they are parsed, we can return the comparison result as soon as a difference is found, potentially reducing the number of comparisons needed.

```cpp
int compareVersion(string version1, string version2) {
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < version1.size() || j < version2.size()) {
        int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
        // Parse the next version part from version1
        while (i < version1.size() && version1[i] != '.') {
            num1 = num1 * 10 + (version1[i++] - '0');
        }
        i++; // Skip the dot if present
        // Parse the next version part from version2
        while (j < version2.size() && version2[j] != '.') {
            num2 = num2 * 10 + (version2[j++] - '0');
        }
        j++; // Skip the dot if present
        
        // Compare the version parts
        if (num1 < num2) return -1;
        else if (num1 > num2) return 1;
    }
    // If all parts are equal, the versions are equal
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `version1` and `version2`, respectively. This is because we iterate through each character of both version strings once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the current version parts being compared.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through each version string, and it minimizes memory usage by avoiding the storage of version parts.
