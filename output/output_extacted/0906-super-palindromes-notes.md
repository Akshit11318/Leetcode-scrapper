## Super Palindromes
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/super-palindromes/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a number `left` and `right`, find all integers `x` with `left <= x <= right` such that the square of `x` is a palindrome.
- Expected output format: Return an array of integers that meet the condition.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling large numbers, checking for palindromes, and considering the range of `left` to `right`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `left = 4` and `right = 1000`, some integers `x` where `x^2` is a palindrome include `4` (since `4^2 = 16` is not a palindrome), `9` (since `9^2 = 81` is a palindrome), and `121` (since `11^2 = 121` is a palindrome).

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to iterate through all integers in the range from `left` to `right`, square each number, and check if the squared result is a palindrome.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Loop through each integer `x` in the range from `left` to `right`.
  2. For each `x`, calculate `x^2`.
  3. Convert `x^2` into a string to easily check if it's a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
  4. If `x^2` is a palindrome, add `x` to the result list.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> superpalindromesInRange(string left, string right) {
        long long leftVal = stoll(left);
        long long rightVal = stoll(right);
        vector<int> result;
        
        for (long long x = 1; x <= 100000; x++) {
            string strX = to_string(x);
            string reversedStrX = strX;
            reverse(reversedStrX.begin(), reversedStrX.end());
            string palindromeStr = strX + reversedStrX;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < strX.size(); i++) {
                string halfPalindromeStr = strX.substr(0, strX.size() - i) + strX.substr(0, i);
                long long palindromeVal = stoll(halfPalindromeStr);
                long long squaredVal = palindromeVal * palindromeVal;
                
                if (squaredVal >= leftVal && squaredVal <= rightVal) {
                    string squaredStr = to_string(squaredVal);
                    string reversedSquaredStr = squaredStr;
                    reverse(reversedSquaredStr.begin(), reversedSquaredStr.end());
                    
                    if (squaredStr == reversedSquaredStr) {
                        result.push_back(palindromeVal);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        sort(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the number of integers in the range and $m$ is the average number of digits in the squared integers. This is due to the nested loop structure and string reversal operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the result list.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves iterating through a large range of numbers, squaring each, converting to strings, and checking for palindromes, leading to high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of checking all integers in the range, generate all possible palindromes that could be squares and check if their square roots fall within the range.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Determine the maximum possible length of a palindrome that could be a square within the given range.
  2. Generate all possible palindromes of that length.
  3. For each palindrome, calculate its square root and check if it falls within the given range.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> superpalindromesInRange(string left, string right) {
        long long leftVal = stoll(left);
        long long rightVal = stoll(right);
        vector<int> result;
        
        for (int len = 1; len <= 10; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < (1 << (len / 2)); i++) {
                string halfStr = "";
                for (int j = 0; j < len / 2; j++) {
                    halfStr += (i >> j & 1) ? '1' : '0';
                }
                string palindromeStr = halfStr;
                if (len % 2 == 1) {
                    palindromeStr += '0' + palindromeStr;
                } else {
                    palindromeStr += palindromeStr;
                }
                
                long long palindromeVal = stoll(palindromeStr);
                long long squaredVal = palindromeVal * palindromeVal;
                
                if (squaredVal >= leftVal && squaredVal <= rightVal) {
                    string squaredStr = to_string(squaredVal);
                    string reversedSquaredStr = squaredStr;
                    reverse(reversedSquaredStr.begin(), reversedSquaredStr.end());
                    
                    if (squaredStr == reversedSquaredStr) {
                        result.push_back(palindromeVal);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        sort(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{len/2} \cdot len)$ where $len$ is the maximum length of a palindrome that could be a square within the given range. This is due to generating all possible palindromes and checking if their squares are within the range.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the result list.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only generates and checks palindromes that could potentially be squares within the given range, avoiding unnecessary checks.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Generating palindromes, checking for palindromes, and optimizing the search space.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Reducing the search space by generating potential solutions instead of checking all possibilities.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using bitwise operations to generate palindromes efficiently.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding all palindromic numbers within a range, checking if a number is a palindrome, and generating all possible palindromic strings.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly handling the case where the length of the palindrome is odd or even, and not properly checking if a number is within the given range.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling large numbers and ensuring that the generated palindromes do not exceed the maximum limit.
- Performance pitfalls: Not optimizing the search space and generating unnecessary palindromes.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with different ranges and edge cases to ensure correctness.
