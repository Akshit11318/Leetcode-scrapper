## Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes a string array `operations` of size `n`, where each `operations[i]` is a string that starts with either `"--X"` or `"X++"`, where `X` is a variable name.
- Expected output format: The final value of variable `X` after all operations are performed.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: We only care about the variable `X`, and we need to count the number of increment and decrement operations.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `operations = ["--X", "X++", "X++"]`, the output should be `1`, because `X` is decremented once and incremented twice.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Count the number of increment and decrement operations for variable `X`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: Iterate through each operation, check if it's an increment or decrement operation, and update the count accordingly.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward and intuitive way to solve the problem.

```cpp
int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
    int x = 0;
    for (const string& operation : operations) {
        if (operation[1] == '+') {
            x++;
        } else {
            x--;
        }
    }
    return x;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of operations, because we iterate through each operation once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the count of `X`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we need to check each operation, and the space complexity is constant because we only need to store a single variable.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can simplify the problem by just counting the difference between the number of increment and decrement operations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: Initialize a count variable to 0, then iterate through each operation. If the operation is an increment, increment the count. If the operation is a decrement, decrement the count.
- Proof of optimality: This solution has the same time and space complexity as the brute force approach, but it's more concise and efficient.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We need to check each operation at least once, so the time complexity cannot be improved.

```cpp
int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const string& operation : operations) {
        if (operation[1] == '+') {
            count++;
        } else {
            count--;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of operations, because we iterate through each operation once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the count.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it has the same time and space complexity as the brute force approach, but it's more concise and efficient.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Counting and comparing the number of increment and decrement operations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Simplifying the problem by counting the difference between increment and decrement operations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve counting and comparing operations, such as `FizzBuzz` or `Counting Elements`.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking the type of operation correctly, or not initializing the count variable correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Operations that are not increment or decrement operations, or operations that are not valid.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary data structures or algorithms that have high time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases and invalid operations.
