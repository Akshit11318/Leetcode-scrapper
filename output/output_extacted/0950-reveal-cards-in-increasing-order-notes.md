## Reveal Cards in Increasing Order

**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/description](https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/description)

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `deck` of size `n`.
- Constraints: `1 <= deck.length <= 1000`, `1 <= deck[i] <= 1000`.
- Expected output: An array of integers representing the deck of cards in the order they are revealed.
- Key requirements: The deck is revealed in increasing order, and the revealed cards are removed from the deck.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `[17,13,11,2,3,5,7]`
  - Output: `[2,13,3,11,5,17,7]`
  - Explanation: The deck is revealed in increasing order, and the revealed cards are removed from the deck.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Sort the deck in increasing order, then remove the smallest card from the deck and add it to the result.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a copy of the input deck.
  2. Sort the copied deck in increasing order.
  3. Initialize an empty result array.
  4. While the copied deck is not empty:
    - Remove the smallest card from the copied deck and add it to the result.
    - If the original deck is not empty, remove the smallest card from the original deck.
  5. Return the result array.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> deckRevealedIncreasing(std::vector<int>& deck) {
    int n = deck.size();
    std::vector<int> index(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        index[i] = i;
    }
    std::vector<int> ans(n);
    std::sort(deck.begin(), deck.end());
    int i = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        ans[index[i]] = deck[i];
        index.erase(index.begin() + i);
        i++;
    }
    return ans;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting of the deck.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the result and the sorted deck.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The sorting operation dominates the time complexity, and the space complexity is due to the additional space required for the result and the sorted deck.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Use a queue to simulate the deck and a vector to store the result.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a queue to store the indices of the deck.
  2. Initialize an empty result array.
  3. Sort the input deck in increasing order.
  4. Iterate over the sorted deck:
    - Dequeue an index from the queue and add the current card to the result at that index.
    - If the queue is not empty, dequeue an index and enqueue it again to simulate the "reveal" operation.
  5. Return the result array.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> deckRevealedIncreasing(std::vector<int>& deck) {
    int n = deck.size();
    std::vector<int> ans(n);
    std::queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        q.push(i);
    }
    std::sort(deck.begin(), deck.end());
    for (int card : deck) {
        ans[q.front()] = card;
        q.pop();
        if (!q.empty()) {
            q.push(q.front());
            q.pop();
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting of the deck.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the result and the queue.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a queue to simulate the deck and a vector to store the result, which are the most efficient data structures for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: sorting, queue operations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using a queue to simulate a deck of cards.
- Optimization techniques learned: using a queue to reduce the number of operations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: incorrect queue operations, incorrect indexing.
- Edge cases to watch for: empty input deck, duplicate cards.
- Performance pitfalls: using inefficient data structures or algorithms.
- Testing considerations: test the function with different input sizes and edge cases.
