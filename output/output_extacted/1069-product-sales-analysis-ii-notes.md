## Product Sales Analysis II

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/product-sales-analysis-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem provides two tables, `Sales` and `Product`. The `Sales` table contains information about sales, including `product_id`, `period_start`, and `period_end`. The `Product` table contains information about products, including `product_id` and `product_name`. The task is to write a SQL query to find the total sales for each product in each period.
- Expected output format: The output should include `product_name`, `period_start`, and `period_end`, along with the total sales for each product in each period.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The query should handle cases where there are no sales for a particular product in a particular period. It should also handle cases where there are multiple sales for a particular product in a particular period.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if the `Sales` table contains the following data:
  | product_id | period_start | period_end | average_daily_sales |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | 2020-01-01 | 2020-01-31 | 100 |
  | 1 | 2020-02-01 | 2020-02-28 | 200 |
  | 2 | 2020-01-01 | 2020-01-31 | 50 |
  The `Product` table contains the following data:
  | product_id | product_name |
  | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Product A |
  | 2 | Product B |
  The query should return the following result:
  | product_name | period_start | period_end | total_sales |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Product A | 2020-01-01 | 2020-01-31 | 3100 |
  | Product A | 2020-02-01 | 2020-02-28 | 5600 |
  | Product B | 2020-01-01 | 2020-01-31 | 1550 |

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach would involve calculating the total sales for each product in each period by summing up the `average_daily_sales` for each product in each period.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Calculate the number of days in each period.
  2. Calculate the total sales for each product in each period by multiplying the `average_daily_sales` by the number of days in the period.
  3. Sum up the total sales for each product in each period.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand. It involves simple arithmetic operations and does not require any complex logic.

```cpp
SELECT 
  p.product_name, 
  s.period_start, 
  s.period_end, 
  SUM(s.average_daily_sales * (DATEDIFF(s.period_end, s.period_start) + 1)) AS total_sales
FROM 
  Sales s
JOIN 
  Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 
  p.product_name, 
  s.period_start, 
  s.period_end
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Sales` table. This is because we are performing a simple aggregation operation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Sales` table. This is because we are storing the intermediate results in memory.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating over each row in the `Sales` table to perform the aggregation operation. The space complexity occurs because we are storing the intermediate results in memory.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach. This is because the problem requires a simple aggregation operation, and there is no way to optimize it further.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the number of days in each period.
  2. Calculate the total sales for each product in each period by multiplying the `average_daily_sales` by the number of days in the period.
  3. Sum up the total sales for each product in each period.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity of $O(n)$ and a space complexity of $O(n)$, which is the best possible complexity for this problem.

```cpp
SELECT 
  p.product_name, 
  s.period_start, 
  s.period_end, 
  SUM(s.average_daily_sales * (DATEDIFF(s.period_end, s.period_start) + 1)) AS total_sales
FROM 
  Sales s
JOIN 
  Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 
  p.product_name, 
  s.period_start, 
  s.period_end
```

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has the best possible time and space complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Simple aggregation operations, joining tables, and calculating dates.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller steps and solving each step individually.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the problem does not require any optimization.
- Similar problems to practice: Other SQL problems that involve aggregation operations and joining tables.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to include the `+ 1` in the `DATEDIFF` function to account for the inclusive end date.
- Edge cases to watch for: Cases where there are no sales for a particular product in a particular period.
- Performance pitfalls: None, because the problem does not require any complex operations.
- Testing considerations: Testing the query with different input data to ensure that it produces the correct results.
