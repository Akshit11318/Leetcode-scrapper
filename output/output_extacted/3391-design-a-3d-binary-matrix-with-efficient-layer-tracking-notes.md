**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-3d-binary-matrix-with-efficient-layer-tracking/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem requires designing a class `ThreeDMatrix` with methods to set and get values in a 3D binary matrix, as well as to change the current layer.
- Expected output format: The methods should return the values or the current layer as specified.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling invalid layer or cell indices, and ensuring efficient tracking of the current layer.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Creating a 3D matrix with a specified size and setting values.
  - Getting values from the matrix.
  - Changing the current layer and verifying its effect on subsequent operations.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: A straightforward approach is to use a 3D array to represent the matrix and implement the required methods directly.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a 3D array with the given dimensions.
  2. Implement the `set` method by directly accessing and modifying the corresponding cell in the 3D array.
  3. Implement the `get` method by returning the value of the corresponding cell in the 3D array.
  4. Implement the `changeLayer` method by updating the current layer index.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement without considering optimizations.

```cpp
class ThreeDMatrix {
private:
    int*** matrix;
    int rows, cols, depth;
    int currentLayer;

public:
    ThreeDMatrix(int rows, int cols, int depth) : rows(rows), cols(cols), depth(depth), currentLayer(0) {
        matrix = new int**[depth];
        for (int i = 0; i < depth; ++i) {
            matrix[i] = new int*[rows];
            for (int j = 0; j < rows; ++j) {
                matrix[i][j] = new int[cols];
                for (int k = 0; k < cols; ++k) {
                    matrix[i][j][k] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    void set(int row, int col, int val) {
        matrix[currentLayer][row][col] = val;
    }

    int get(int row, int col) {
        return matrix[currentLayer][row][col];
    }

    void changeLayer(int layer) {
        if (layer >= 0 && layer < depth) {
            currentLayer = layer;
        }
    }

    ~ThreeDMatrix() {
        for (int i = 0; i < depth; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < rows; ++j) {
                delete[] matrix[i][j];
            }
            delete[] matrix[i];
        }
        delete[] matrix;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ for all operations since they involve direct access or simple updates.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(rows \times cols \times depth)$ due to the 3D array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** Direct access and modification operations are constant time, and the space is dominated by the storage required for the 3D matrix.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The brute force approach is already optimal in terms of time complexity for the given operations. However, we can improve the implementation by using a more modern and safer C++ approach, such as using vectors instead of manual memory management.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use a 3D vector to represent the matrix, ensuring dynamic memory management and avoiding manual memory deallocation.
  2. Implement the `set`, `get`, and `changeLayer` methods similarly to the brute force approach but using vector indexing.
- Proof of optimality: The operations remain $O(1)$, and the space complexity is still $O(rows \times cols \times depth)$, but with improved safety and less chance of memory leaks.

```cpp
#include <vector>

class ThreeDMatrix {
private:
    std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>> matrix;
    int rows, cols, depth;
    int currentLayer;

public:
    ThreeDMatrix(int rows, int cols, int depth) : rows(rows), cols(cols), depth(depth), currentLayer(0) {
        matrix.resize(depth, std::vector<std::vector<int>>(rows, std::vector<int>(cols, 0)));
    }

    void set(int row, int col, int val) {
        matrix[currentLayer][row][col] = val;
    }

    int get(int row, int col) {
        return matrix[currentLayer][row][col];
    }

    void changeLayer(int layer) {
        if (layer >= 0 && layer < depth) {
            currentLayer = layer;
        }
    }
};
```
