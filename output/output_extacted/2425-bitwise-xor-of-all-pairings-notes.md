## Bitwise XOR of All Pairings
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-xor-of-all-pairings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 100`, `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`.
- Expected output: The XOR of all pairings of numbers in the array.
- Key requirements: The XOR operation has a property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`.
- Example test cases: 
  - Input: `nums = [1, 2]`
    - Output: `3` because `(1 XOR 2) = 3`.
  - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
    - Output: `2` because `(1 XOR 2) XOR (1 XOR 3) XOR (2 XOR 3) = 3 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 0 XOR 2 = 2`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves generating all possible pairs of numbers in the array and then computing the XOR of each pair.
- We then XOR all these results together to get the final answer.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement without considering any optimizations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int xorAllPairings(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int result = 0;
        
        // Generate all pairs and XOR them
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                result ^= (nums[i] ^ nums[j]);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we generate all pairs of numbers, resulting in a quadratic number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not counting the space needed for the input and output. We only use a constant amount of space to store the result and loop indices.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops to generate all pairs, leading to the quadratic time complexity. The space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight leading to the optimal solution is recognizing that XOR is commutative and associative, and that `a ^ a = 0`.
- For any pair of numbers `(a, b)`, the XOR of the pair is `a ^ b`. Since XOR is commutative, `a ^ b = b ^ a`.
- When considering all pairs, each number will be paired with every other number exactly once. Thus, for any given number `a`, it will appear in the XOR operation with every other number exactly once.
- Given the properties of XOR, if a number `a` appears an even number of times in the XOR operations across all pairs, its contribution to the final result will be `0` (because `a ^ a = 0`).
- However, if `a` appears an odd number of times, its contribution will be `a` itself.
- Since each number is paired with every other number exactly once, and considering the XOR of all these pairs, we can simplify the problem by observing the pattern of XOR operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int xorAllPairings(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int result = 0;
        
        // Simplified approach considering XOR properties
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            for (int num : nums) {
                result ^= num;
            }
        } else {
            // For even number of elements, we can directly compute the XOR of all elements
            for (int num : nums) {
                result ^= num;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we only need to iterate through the array once to compute the XOR of all elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, not counting the space needed for the input and output. We only use a constant amount of space to store the result and loop indices.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to compute the XOR of all pairings. By leveraging the properties of the XOR operation, we avoid the need for generating all pairs explicitly, reducing the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.
