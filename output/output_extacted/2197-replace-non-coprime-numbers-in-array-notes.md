## Replace Non-Coprime Numbers in Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-non-coprime-numbers-in-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of integers `nums` where each element is in the range $[1, 10^5]$, replace every element with the least common multiple (LCM) of the element and its index (1-indexed). If an element is coprime with its index, do not replace it.
- Expected output format: The modified array after replacing non-coprime numbers with their LCM.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - The array can be empty.
    - The array can contain duplicate elements.
    - The index is 1-indexed.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - For `nums = [2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output should be `[6, 3, 12, 5]` because:
        - For `nums[0] = 2` (at index 1), the LCM of 2 and 1 is 2, which is coprime, so it remains 2.
        - For `nums[1] = 3` (at index 2), the LCM of 3 and 2 is 6, which is not coprime, so it becomes 6.
        - For `nums[2] = 4` (at index 3), the LCM of 4 and 3 is 12, which is not coprime, so it becomes 12.
        - For `nums[3] = 5` (at index 4), the LCM of 5 and 4 is 20, which is not coprime, so it becomes 20.

However, upon closer inspection of the example given, the initial interpretation seems incorrect based on the standard definition of coprime numbers and LCM. Let's correct the approach based on the actual requirement to replace numbers that are not coprime with their index with the LCM of the number and its index.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To solve this problem, we first need to understand what it means for two numbers to be coprime. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Iterate through the array.
    2. For each element, calculate its GCD with its index (1-indexed).
    3. If the GCD is not 1 (meaning they are not coprime), calculate the LCM of the element and its index.
    4. Replace the element with the calculated LCM if it's not coprime with its index.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
}

std::vector<int> replaceNonCoprimes(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int index = i + 1; // 1-indexed
        if (gcd(nums[i], index) != 1) {
            nums[i] = lcm(nums[i], index);
        }
    }
    return nums;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot log(min(a, b)))$ where $n$ is the size of the input array and $log(min(a, b))$ comes from the GCD calculation using the Euclidean algorithm for each element.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ if we consider the space required for the output as part of the input space, otherwise $O(n)$ for storing the result.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the GCD calculation for each element, and the space complexity depends on whether we count the output array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The current brute force approach is already quite efficient, leveraging the Euclidean algorithm for GCD and then calculating LCM based on GCD. However, we can slightly optimize it by using a more efficient method for calculating GCD, such as using the `__gcd` function provided by the C++ standard library if available, or ensuring our recursive GCD function is optimized.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Same as the brute force, but with an optimized GCD calculation if possible.
- Proof of optimality: The problem requires checking each element against its index, making the time complexity at least $O(n)$. The additional $log(min(a, b))$ factor from the GCD calculation is necessary for determining coprimality and calculating LCM.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // For std::gcd

std::vector<int> replaceNonCoprimesOptimal(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int index = i + 1; // 1-indexed
        if (std::gcd(nums[i], index) != 1) {
            nums[i] = (nums[i] * index) / std::gcd(nums[i], index);
        }
    }
    return nums;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot log(min(a, b)))$ where $n$ is the size of the input array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ or $O(n)$ depending on the output consideration.
> - **Optimality proof:** The solution is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to solve the problem, leveraging the most efficient GCD calculation available.
