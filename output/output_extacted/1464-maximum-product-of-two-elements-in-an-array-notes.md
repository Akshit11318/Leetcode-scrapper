## Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-two-elements-in-an-array/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `nums`.
- Constraints: The length of `nums` is `n`, where `2 <= n <= 1000`, and `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`.
- Expected output format: The maximum product of two elements in the array.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input array contains at least two elements, and all elements are positive integers.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = [1, 20, 3]`, the output should be `60`, which is the product of `20` and `3`.
  - For `nums = [10, 10, 10]`, the output should be `100`, which is the product of `10` and `10`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the maximum product of two elements in the array, we can compare each pair of elements and calculate their product.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `maxProduct` to store the maximum product found so far.
  2. Iterate over the array using two nested loops to consider each pair of elements.
  3. For each pair, calculate the product and update `maxProduct` if the current product is larger.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive solution that considers all possible pairs of elements.

```cpp
int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxProduct = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            maxProduct = max(maxProduct, nums[i] * nums[j]);
        }
    }
    return maxProduct;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array, because we are using two nested loops to iterate over the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `maxProduct` variable.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is quadratic because we are considering each pair of elements in the array, resulting in $n \cdot (n-1) / 2$ comparisons. The space complexity is constant because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The maximum product of two elements in the array will be the product of the two largest elements.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize variables `max1` and `max2` to store the two largest elements in the array.
  2. Iterate over the array to find the two largest elements.
  3. Calculate the product of `max1` and `max2` and return it as the result.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the array, resulting in a linear time complexity.

```cpp
int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
    int max1 = INT_MIN, max2 = INT_MIN;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num > max1) {
            max2 = max1;
            max1 = num;
        } else if (num > max2) {
            max2 = num;
        }
    }
    return max1 * max2;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array, because we are only iterating over the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `max1` and `max2` variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has a linear time complexity, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem. We must at least read the input array once to find the two largest elements.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Finding the maximum product of two elements in an array can be solved by finding the two largest elements in the array.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a single pass over the array to find the two largest elements is an efficient approach.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary comparisons by only considering each element once.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the maximum sum of two elements in an array, finding the minimum product of two elements in an array.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing variables correctly, not handling edge cases properly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input array, input array with a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach with a quadratic time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input arrays, including edge cases and large input arrays.
