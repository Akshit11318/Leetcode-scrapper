## Minimum Absolute Sum Difference
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-sum-difference/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, find the minimum absolute sum difference between the sums of any subarray from `nums1` and any subarray from `nums2`.
- Input format: Two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
- Expected output format: The minimum absolute sum difference.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - Both arrays can be empty.
  - Subarrays can be of any length.
  - The sum of a subarray can exceed the maximum limit of an integer.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `nums1 = [1, 7, 5]`, `nums2 = [2, 3, 5]`, the minimum absolute sum difference is `3` (`1 + 7` vs `2 + 3`).
  - `nums1 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, `nums2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, the minimum absolute sum difference is `0` (identical arrays).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves generating all possible subarrays from both `nums1` and `nums2`, then comparing the sums of these subarrays to find the minimum absolute difference.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Generate all possible subarrays from `nums1` and `nums2`.
  2. For each subarray from `nums1`, calculate its sum.
  3. For each subarray from `nums2`, calculate its sum.
  4. Compare each sum from `nums1` with each sum from `nums2`, calculating the absolute difference.
  5. Keep track of the minimum absolute difference found.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

int minAbsoluteSumDiff(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j = i; j < nums1.size(); ++j) {
            int sum1 = 0;
            for (int k = i; k <= j; ++k) {
                sum1 += nums1[k];
            }
            for (int p = 0; p < nums2.size(); ++p) {
                for (int q = p; q < nums2.size(); ++q) {
                    int sum2 = 0;
                    for (int r = p; r <= q; ++r) {
                        sum2 += nums2[r];
                    }
                    minDiff = std::min(minDiff, std::abs(sum1 - sum2));
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return minDiff;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^4)$ where $n$ is the size of the larger array, because for each subarray in `nums1`, we're potentially comparing with every subarray in `nums2`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the input arrays, since we're not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves nested loops to generate all possible subarrays and compare their sums, leading to a high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a single pass through both arrays to calculate prefix sums, then use these prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Calculate prefix sums for both `nums1` and `nums2`.
  2. Iterate through all possible start and end indices for subarrays in `nums1` and `nums2`.
  3. For each subarray in `nums1`, calculate its sum using the prefix sums.
  4. For each subarray in `nums2`, calculate its sum using the prefix sums.
  5. Compare the sums and update the minimum absolute difference.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

int minAbsoluteSumDiff(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
    int n = nums1.size();
    int m = nums2.size();
    std::vector<int> prefixSum1(n + 1, 0);
    std::vector<int> prefixSum2(m + 1, 0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefixSum1[i + 1] = prefixSum1[i] + nums1[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        prefixSum2[i + 1] = prefixSum2[i] + nums2[i];
    }
    
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
            int sum1 = prefixSum1[j + 1] - prefixSum1[i];
            for (int p = 0; p < m; ++p) {
                for (int q = p; q < m; ++q) {
                    int sum2 = prefixSum2[q + 1] - prefixSum2[p];
                    minDiff = std::min(minDiff, std::abs(sum1 - sum2));
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return minDiff;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 * m^2)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively, because we're still comparing all possible subarrays from both arrays.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ for storing the prefix sums of `nums1` and `nums2`.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is more efficient than the brute force in terms of calculating subarray sums but still has a high time complexity due to comparing all subarrays. Further optimization is possible by considering the properties of subarray sums and their differences.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of prefix sums in efficiently calculating subarray sums.
- The need to consider all possible subarrays for a comprehensive comparison.
- The potential for optimization by leveraging properties of the data or the problem constraints.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the prefix sum approach for calculating subarray sums efficiently.
- Not accounting for all possible subarrays in the comparison.
- Overlooking potential optimizations based on the problem's constraints or properties.
