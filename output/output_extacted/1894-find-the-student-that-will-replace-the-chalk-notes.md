## Find the Student That Will Replace the Chalk
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-student-that-will-replace-the-chalk/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a `chalk` array representing the amount of chalk each student has, and an integer `k` representing the amount of chalk the teacher has.
- Expected output format: The index of the student who will replace the chalk.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - If a student's chalk is less than the teacher's chalk, they cannot replace it.
    - If multiple students can replace the chalk, return the one with the smallest index.
- Example test cases with explanations:
    - `chalk = [5,1,5,7]`, `k = 5`, output: `2`
    - `chalk = [3,4,4]`, `k = 2`, output: `0`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through the `chalk` array and check each student's chalk against the teacher's chalk `k`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize the minimum index and chalk difference.
    2. Iterate through the `chalk` array.
    3. For each student, check if their chalk is greater than or equal to the teacher's chalk.
    4. If it is, update the minimum index and chalk difference if necessary.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a simple, straightforward solution that checks each student's chalk against the teacher's chalk.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int chalkReplacer(vector<int>& chalk, int k) {
        int n = chalk.size();
        long long sum = 0;
        for (int c : chalk) sum += c;
        k %= sum;
        int i = 0;
        while (k >= chalk[i]) {
            k -= chalk[i];
            i = (i + 1) % n;
        }
        return i;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of students. We iterate through the `chalk` array once to calculate the sum, and then again to find the student who will replace the chalk.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and the index of the student who will replace the chalk.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we iterate through the `chalk` array twice, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the modulo operator to reduce the number of iterations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Calculate the sum of the `chalk` array.
    2. Use the modulo operator to reduce `k` to a value between 0 and the sum of the `chalk` array.
    3. Iterate through the `chalk` array, subtracting each student's chalk from `k` until we find the student who will replace the chalk.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses the modulo operator to reduce the number of iterations, and it only iterates through the `chalk` array once.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We must iterate through the `chalk` array at least once to find the student who will replace the chalk, so this approach is already optimal.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int chalkReplacer(vector<int>& chalk, int k) {
        int n = chalk.size();
        long long sum = 0;
        for (int c : chalk) sum += c;
        k %= sum;
        int i = 0;
        while (k >= chalk[i]) {
            k -= chalk[i];
            i = (i + 1) % n;
        }
        return i;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Using the modulo operator to reduce the number of iterations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Iterating through an array to find a specific element.
