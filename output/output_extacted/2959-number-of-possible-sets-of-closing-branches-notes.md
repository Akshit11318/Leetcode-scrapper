## Number of Possible Sets of Closing Branches

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-possible-sets-of-closing-branches/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `a` where each element represents the number of closing branches at each node.
- Constraints: The input array `a` is guaranteed to be non-empty.
- Expected Output: The number of possible sets of closing branches.
- Key Requirements:
  - A set of closing branches is valid if the number of closing branches at each node is less than or equal to the number of closing branches at its parent node.
  - The number of possible sets of closing branches should be calculated for each node in the tree.
- Edge Cases:
  - The input array `a` may contain duplicate values.
  - The input array `a` may be sorted or unsorted.
- Example Test Cases:
  - For the input `a = [1, 2, 3]`, the output should be `3` because there are three possible sets of closing branches: `{1}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The brute force approach involves generating all possible subsets of the input array `a` and checking each subset to see if it represents a valid set of closing branches.
- This approach comes to mind first because it is a straightforward way to generate all possible sets of closing branches.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int numberOfPossibleSets(std::vector<int>& a) {
    int n = a.size();
    int count = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        bool isValid = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    if ((mask & (1 << j)) != 0 && a[j] > a[i]) {
                        isValid = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!isValid) break;
            }
        }
        if (isValid) count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array `a`. This is because we generate all possible subsets of `a` and check each subset in $O(n^2)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the input array `a` and the subset mask.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we generate all possible subsets of `a`, which takes $O(2^n)$ time. The space complexity occurs because we only use a constant amount of space to store the input array `a` and the subset mask.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach involves using dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible sets of closing branches.
- We use a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of possible sets of closing branches for the subtree rooted at node `i`.
- We calculate `dp[i]` by iterating over all children of node `i` and calculating the number of possible sets of closing branches for each child.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int numberOfPossibleSets(std::vector<int>& a) {
    int n = a.size();
    std::vector<int> dp(n, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (a[j] >= a[i]) {
                dp[i] += dp[j];
            }
        }
        if (dp[i] == 0) dp[i] = 1;
    }
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        count += dp[i];
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array `a`. This is because we iterate over all elements in `a` and calculate the number of possible sets of closing branches for each element in $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we use a dynamic programming table `dp` of size $n$ to store the number of possible sets of closing branches for each node.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach is optimal because it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible sets of closing branches for each node in the tree. This approach avoids the overhead of generating all possible subsets of `a` and checking each subset, which reduces the time complexity from $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$ to $O(n^2)$.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The problem requires calculating the number of possible sets of closing branches for each node in the tree.
- The brute force approach involves generating all possible subsets of the input array `a` and checking each subset to see if it represents a valid set of closing branches.
- The optimal approach involves using dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible sets of closing branches for each node in the tree.
- The optimal approach has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ and a space complexity of $O(n)$.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Generating all possible subsets of the input array `a` and checking each subset to see if it represents a valid set of closing branches. This approach has a high time complexity of $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$.
- Not using dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible sets of closing branches for each node in the tree. This approach can reduce the time complexity from $O(2^n \cdot n^2)$ to $O(n^2)$.
