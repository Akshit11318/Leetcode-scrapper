## Maximum Value Sum by Placing Three Rooks I
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-sum-by-placing-three-rooks-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A 3x3 grid where each cell contains an integer.
- Constraints: The grid is guaranteed to be 3x3.
- Expected Output: The maximum sum of values that can be obtained by selecting three cells, one from each row and column, without selecting more than one cell from the same row or column.
- Key Requirements and Edge Cases: Since the grid is fixed at 3x3, the main focus is on finding the optimal combination of cells that maximizes the sum.

**Example Test Cases:**
- For the grid `[[5,1,0],[3,0,9],[1,2,4]]`, the maximum sum is obtained by selecting the cells at positions (0,0), (1,2), and (2,1), resulting in a sum of `5 + 9 + 2 = 16`.
- For the grid `[[8,1,3],[2,7,6],[5,4,9]]`, the maximum sum is obtained by selecting the cells at positions (0,0), (1,1), and (2,2), resulting in a sum of `8 + 7 + 9 = 24`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves trying all possible combinations of cells from different rows and columns to find the maximum sum.
- This approach involves generating all permutations of 3 cells from the 3x3 grid, ensuring each cell is from a different row and column.
- The brute force approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the requirement without considering optimizations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
                for (int l = 0; l < 3; l++) {
                    for (int m = 0; m < 3; m++) {
                        if (i != k && i != m && k != m && j != l && j != m && l != m) {
                            maxSum = max(maxSum, grid[0][i] + grid[1][j] + grid[2][k] + grid[1][l] + grid[2][m]);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(3^6)$ because we have six nested loops, each iterating over 3 possibilities. However, this initial analysis simplifies to considering the actual permutations of selecting 3 cells from different rows and columns, which still results in a high time complexity due to the brute force nature.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum sum and loop variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach generates all possible combinations without any optimization, leading to high time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight to the optimal solution involves recognizing that we are dealing with a permutation problem where we need to select one cell from each row and column exactly once.
- We can use a more systematic approach to generate these permutations and calculate the sum for each permutation.
- The optimal solution involves iterating through all possible permutations of selecting one cell from each row and calculating the sum for each permutation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;
    vector<int> permutation = {0, 1, 2}; // Represents the columns to select from each row
    
    do {
        int currentSum = grid[0][permutation[0]] + grid[1][permutation[1]] + grid[2][permutation[2]];
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum);
    } while (next_permutation(permutation.begin(), permutation.end()));
    
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(3!)$ or $O(6)$ because we generate all permutations of selecting one cell from each row and column. This is significantly better than the brute force approach.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the permutation and the maximum sum.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it systematically explores all possible combinations of selecting one cell from each row and column without repetition, ensuring that the maximum sum is found with minimal computational effort.
