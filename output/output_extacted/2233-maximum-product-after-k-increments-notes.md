## Maximum Product After K Increments
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-after-k-increments/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Output: The maximum product of `nums` after incrementing `k` elements.
- Key Requirements:
  - Each element in `nums` can be incremented by 1.
  - The goal is to maximize the product of all elements in `nums` after at most `k` increments.
- Edge Cases:
  - `nums` can contain zeros or negative numbers.
  - `k` can be zero or greater than the length of `nums`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of increments to find the maximum product.
- This involves generating all subsets of `nums` of size up to `k`, incrementing the elements in each subset, and calculating the product of the resulting array.
- However, this approach quickly becomes infeasible due to its exponential time complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int maxProductAfterKIncrements(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxProduct = 0;
    
    // Generate all subsets of nums of size up to k
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        int subsetSize = 0;
        std::vector<int> subset(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                subset[i] = nums[i] + 1;
                subsetSize++;
            } else {
                subset[i] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Check if the subset size is within the limit k
        if (subsetSize <= k) {
            int product = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                product *= subset[i];
            }
            maxProduct = std::max(maxProduct, product);
        }
    }
    
    return maxProduct;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. This is because we generate all subsets of `nums` and calculate the product for each subset.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. This is because we create a subset array of size $n$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible subsets of `nums`, which leads to exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear because we only need to store a subset array of size $n$.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to sort `nums` in ascending order and increment the smallest elements first.
- This approach is optimal because incrementing the smallest elements has the greatest impact on the overall product.
- We can use a priority queue or sorting to find the smallest elements efficiently.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxProductAfterKIncrements(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n && i < k; i++) {
        nums[i]++;
    }
    
    int product = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        product *= nums[i];
    }
    
    return product;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. This is because we sort `nums` using a comparison-based sorting algorithm.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums`. This is because we only modify the input array in place.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because incrementing the smallest elements has the greatest impact on the overall product. By sorting `nums` and incrementing the smallest elements first, we maximize the product in the fewest number of increments.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of sorting and priority queues in finding the smallest or largest elements efficiently.
- The concept of incrementing the smallest elements first to maximize the overall product.
- The trade-off between time and space complexity in different approaches.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Generating all possible subsets of the input array, which leads to exponential time complexity.
- Not considering the impact of incrementing the smallest elements on the overall product.
- Not optimizing the approach to minimize the number of increments needed to achieve the maximum product.
