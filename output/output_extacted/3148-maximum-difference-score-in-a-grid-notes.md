## Maximum Difference Score in a Grid

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-score-in-a-grid/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D grid of integers `grid` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: The grid has dimensions `m x n`, and `k` is a positive integer.
- Expected output format: The maximum possible difference score.
- Key requirements: To find the maximum possible difference score, we need to consider all possible ways to divide the grid into two groups and calculate the sum of each group.
- Edge cases to consider: The grid can be empty, or `k` can be larger than the number of elements in the grid.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Example 1: `grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 2`, the output should be `10`.
- Example 2: `grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], k = 3`, the output should be `0`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can try all possible ways to divide the grid into two groups and calculate the sum of each group.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of the grid.
  2. For each subset, calculate the sum of the elements in the subset and the sum of the elements not in the subset.
  3. Calculate the difference score for each subset and keep track of the maximum difference score.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and guarantees the correct answer, but it is inefficient for large grids.

```cpp
int maxDifferenceScore(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int k) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int maxScore = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << (m * n)); mask++) {
        int sum1 = 0;
        int sum2 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << (i * n + j))) != 0) {
                    sum1 += grid[i][j];
                } else {
                    sum2 += grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        if (sum1 > sum2) {
            maxScore = max(maxScore, sum1 - sum2);
        }
    }
    return maxScore;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{m \cdot n} \cdot m \cdot n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the grid. This is because we generate all possible subsets of the grid and calculate the sum of each subset.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum difference score and the sums of the subsets.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we try all possible subsets of the grid, and the space complexity is low because we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The maximum difference score can be obtained by finding the maximum sum of a subset of the grid and the minimum sum of the remaining elements.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the elements of the grid in descending order.
  2. Calculate the sum of the first $k$ elements, which is the maximum sum of a subset of size $k$.
  3. Calculate the sum of the remaining elements, which is the minimum sum of the remaining elements.
  4. Return the difference between the two sums.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it guarantees the maximum difference score by finding the maximum sum of a subset of size $k$ and the minimum sum of the remaining elements.

```cpp
int maxDifferenceScore(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int k) {
    vector<int> elements;
    for (auto& row : grid) {
        for (int element : row) {
            elements.push_back(element);
        }
    }
    sort(elements.rbegin(), elements.rend());
    int sum1 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        sum1 += elements[i];
    }
    int sum2 = 0;
    for (int i = k; i < elements.size(); i++) {
        sum2 += elements[i];
    }
    return sum1 - sum2;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, subset sum, and difference score calculation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Finding the maximum sum of a subset and the minimum sum of the remaining elements.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using sorting to find the maximum sum of a subset and the minimum sum of the remaining elements.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not sorting the elements of the grid, not calculating the sum of the first $k$ elements correctly, and not calculating the sum of the remaining elements correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: The grid can be empty, or $k$ can be larger than the number of elements in the grid.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that tries all possible subsets of the grid.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including empty grids and grids with different dimensions.
