## Is Object Empty
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/is-object-empty/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an object `s`.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if the object `s` is empty, otherwise return `false`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The object can contain any type of values, including strings, integers, floats, etc. It can also be `null` or `undefined`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - `s = {"a": 1, "b": 2}`: Returns `false` because the object is not empty.
  - `s = {}`: Returns `true` because the object is empty.
  - `s = null`: Returns `true` because the object is `null`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can simply check if the object is `null` or if it has any keys.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Check if the object is `null`.
  2. If it's not `null`, check if it has any keys.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This is the most straightforward way to check if an object is empty.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool is_empty(unordered_map<int, int> s) {
        // Check if the object is null
        if (s.empty()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // If it's not null, check if it has any keys
        return s.size() == 0;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we're just checking the size of the object.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we're not using any extra space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we're not iterating over the object or using any extra space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can simply check if the object is empty using the `empty()` function.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Check if the object is empty using the `empty()` function.
- Proof of optimality: This is the most efficient way to check if an object is empty because it doesn't require iterating over the object.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This is already the most efficient way to check if an object is empty.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool is_empty(unordered_map<int, int> s) {
        // Check if the object is empty
        return s.empty();
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we're just checking the size of the object.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we're not using any extra space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the most efficient way to check if an object is empty because it doesn't require iterating over the object.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Checking if an object is empty.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using the `empty()` function to check if an object is empty.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using the most efficient way to check if an object is empty.
- Similar problems to practice: Checking if a string is empty, checking if a list is empty, etc.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking if the object is `null` before checking if it's empty.
- Edge cases to watch for: The object being `null` or `undefined`.
- Performance pitfalls: Iterating over the object to check if it's empty.
- Testing considerations: Testing with different types of objects, including `null` and `undefined`.
