## Greatest Common Divisor of Strings
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, find the greatest common divisor of these two strings. The greatest common divisor is the largest string that can divide both `str1` and `str2` without a remainder.
- Expected output format: The function should return the greatest common divisor of `str1` and `str2`. If no common divisor exists, return an empty string.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Both input strings are non-empty and consist only of lowercase English letters.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"`. Output: `"ABC"`.
  - Example 2: Input: `str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"`. Output: `"AB"`.
  - Example 3: Input: `str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"`. Output: `""`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check all possible substrings of the shorter string to see if they can divide both input strings without a remainder.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Determine the shorter string.
  2. Generate all possible substrings of the shorter string.
  3. For each substring, check if it can divide both input strings without a remainder.
  4. Keep track of the longest substring that satisfies this condition.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward and ensures that all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string gcdOfStrings(string str1, string str2) {
    // Check if the concatenation of str1 and str2 is equal to the concatenation of str2 and str1
    if (str1 + str2 != str2 + str1) return "";
    
    int len1 = str1.length(), len2 = str2.length();
    int gcdLen = gcd(len1, len2);
    
    return str1.substr(0, gcdLen);
}

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively. This is because we are concatenating the strings and then checking for equality.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, for storing the concatenated strings.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the string concatenation and comparison, while the space complexity is due to the storage of the concatenated strings.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The greatest common divisor of two strings must be a divisor of both strings' lengths. This is because if a string `s` can be divided into `n` parts of length `l`, then `s`'s length is `n * l`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the greatest common divisor of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.
  2. Check if the substring of `str1` with the calculated length can divide both `str1` and `str2` without a remainder.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the greatest common divisor without needing to generate all possible substrings.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n + m)$, which is the minimum required to read the input strings.

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string gcdOfStrings(string str1, string str2) {
    // Check if the concatenation of str1 and str2 is equal to the concatenation of str2 and str1
    if (str1 + str2 != str2 + str1) return "";
    
    int len1 = str1.length(), len2 = str2.length();
    int gcdLen = gcd(len1, len2);
    
    return str1.substr(0, gcdLen);
}

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, for storing the concatenated strings.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greatest common divisor calculation, string manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Checking for the existence of a common divisor by concatenating strings and comparing them.
- Optimization techniques learned: Direct calculation of the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the least common multiple of two numbers, checking if a string is a rotation of another string.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking if the concatenation of `str1` and `str2` is equal to the concatenation of `str2` and `str1`.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input strings, strings with different lengths.
- Performance pitfalls: Generating all possible substrings of the input strings.
- Testing considerations: Test with different input strings, including edge cases.
