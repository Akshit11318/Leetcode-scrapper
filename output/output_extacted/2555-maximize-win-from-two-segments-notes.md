## Maximize Win From Two Segments

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-win-from-two-segments/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two arrays `num1` and `num2` representing scores in two segments, and an integer `k` representing the number of operations allowed.
- Expected output: The maximum score that can be achieved after `k` operations.
- Key requirements: Each operation involves choosing a segment and increasing its score by 1.
- Edge cases: Consider when `k` is larger than the sum of the lengths of the two segments, or when one segment is significantly longer than the other.

**Example Test Cases:**
- `num1 = [1, 2, 3]`, `num2 = [4, 5, 6]`, `k = 3`. The maximum score can be achieved by adding 1 to each segment three times.
- `num1 = [1, 1, 1]`, `num2 = [1, 1, 1]`, `k = 3`. The maximum score is achieved by adding 1 to one segment three times.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves trying all possible combinations of operations on the two segments.
- Step-by-step breakdown: For each segment, try adding 1 to it `i` times, where `i` ranges from 0 to `k`. Then, try adding 1 to the other segment `k - i` times.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward application of the problem statement, trying all possible ways to distribute the `k` operations between the two segments.

```cpp
int maximizeWinFromTwoSegments(vector<int>& num1, vector<int>& num2, int k) {
    int maxScore = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
        int score1 = 0, score2 = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < num1.size(); j++) score1 += num1[j];
        for (int j = 0; j < num2.size(); j++) score2 += num2[j];
        score1 += i; score2 += k - i;
        maxScore = max(maxScore, score1 + score2);
    }
    return maxScore;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k)$, where $k$ is the number of operations. This is because we have a loop that runs from 0 to $k$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the scores and the maximum score.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the loop that tries all possible distributions of operations, and the space complexity is due to the fact that we only need a constant amount of space to store the relevant information.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The optimal strategy is to add 1 to the segment with the higher score until the scores are equal, and then add 1 to both segments equally.
- Detailed breakdown: First, calculate the initial total score by summing up all elements in both segments. Then, calculate the difference in lengths between the two segments. If the difference is greater than `k`, we can only add 1 to the longer segment until the difference is `k`. Otherwise, we add 1 to the longer segment until the scores are equal, and then add 1 to both segments equally.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures that the scores are as high as possible after `k` operations. By adding 1 to the segment with the higher score, we maximize the increase in the total score.

```cpp
int maximizeWinFromTwoSegments(vector<int>& num1, vector<int>& num2, int k) {
    int score1 = 0, score2 = 0;
    for (int num : num1) score1 += num;
    for (int num : num2) score2 += num;
    int diff = abs(num1.size() - num2.size());
    if (diff > k) {
        if (num1.size() > num2.size()) {
            score1 += k;
        } else {
            score2 += k;
        }
    } else {
        if (score1 > score2) {
            score1 += k;
        } else if (score2 > score1) {
            score2 += k;
        } else {
            score1 += k / 2;
            score2 += k / 2;
            if (k % 2 == 1) {
                if (num1.size() > num2.size()) {
                    score1 += 1;
                } else {
                    score2 += 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return score1 + score2;
}
```
