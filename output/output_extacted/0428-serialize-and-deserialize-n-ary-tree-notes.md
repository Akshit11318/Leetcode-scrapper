## Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-n-ary-tree/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An N-ary tree represented as a `Node` object, where each node has a unique value and a list of child nodes.
- Constraints: The input tree is guaranteed to be non-empty, and each node has a unique value between 1 and 10^5.
- Expected output format: A serialized string representation of the input tree, and a deserialized `Node` object from the serialized string.
- Key requirements: Implement a `Codec` class with `serialize` and `deserialize` methods to convert the N-ary tree to and from a string representation.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `Node(1, [Node(3), Node(2), Node(4)])`
  - Output: `"1,3,,2,4,,,"`
  - Explanation: The serialized string represents the tree structure, where each node is separated by a comma, and child nodes are represented by a comma-separated list.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and build the serialized string.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Start at the root node and append its value to the serialized string.
  2. Recursively traverse each child node and append its value to the serialized string, separated by commas.
  3. Use a comma-separated list to represent child nodes.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The DFS approach is a natural fit for tree traversals, and the comma-separated list is a simple way to represent the tree structure.

```cpp
class Codec {
public:
    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    string serialize(Node* root) {
        string result;
        serializeHelper(root, result);
        return result;
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    Node* deserialize(string data) {
        istringstream iss(data);
        string token;
        vector<string> tokens;
        while (getline(iss, token, ',')) {
            tokens.push_back(token);
        }
        return deserializeHelper(tokens);
    }

    void serializeHelper(Node* node, string& result) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            result += ",,";
            return;
        }
        result += to_string(node->val) + ",";
        for (auto child : node->children) {
            serializeHelper(child, result);
        }
        result += ",";
    }

    Node* deserializeHelper(vector<string>& tokens, int& index) {
        if (tokens[index] == "") {
            index++;
            return nullptr;
        }
        Node* node = new Node(stoi(tokens[index]));
        index++;
        for (auto& token : tokens) {
            if (token == "") break;
            node->children.push_back(deserializeHelper(tokens, index));
        }
        return node;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree, since we visit each node once during serialization and deserialization.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, since we store the serialized string and the deserialized tree in memory.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we visit each node once, and the space complexity is linear because we store the entire tree in memory.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: We can use a more efficient serialization format, such as prefix notation, to reduce the number of commas and improve performance.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Use a recursive DFS approach to traverse the tree and build the serialized string.
  2. Use prefix notation to represent the tree structure, where each node is followed by its children.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of commas and reduces the overall length of the serialized string.

```cpp
class Codec {
public:
    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    string serialize(Node* root) {
        string result;
        serializeHelper(root, result);
        return result;
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    Node* deserialize(string data) {
        istringstream iss(data);
        string token;
        vector<string> tokens;
        while (getline(iss, token, ',')) {
            tokens.push_back(token);
        }
        int index = 0;
        return deserializeHelper(tokens, index);
    }

    void serializeHelper(Node* node, string& result) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            result += "#,";
            return;
        }
        result += to_string(node->val) + ",";
        for (auto child : node->children) {
            serializeHelper(child, result);
        }
    }

    Node* deserializeHelper(vector<string>& tokens, int& index) {
        if (index >= tokens.size() || tokens[index] == "#") {
            index++;
            return nullptr;
        }
        Node* node = new Node(stoi(tokens[index]));
        index++;
        for (auto& token : tokens) {
            if (index >= tokens.size()) break;
            node->children.push_back(deserializeHelper(tokens, index));
        }
        return node;
    }
};
```
