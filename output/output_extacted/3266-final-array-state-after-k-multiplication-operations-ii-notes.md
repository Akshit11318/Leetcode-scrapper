## Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/final-array-state-after-k-multiplication-operations-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `initialArray` and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= initialArray.length <= 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^6`.
- Expected output format: The state of the array after `k` multiplication operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling large inputs, avoiding overflow, and optimizing the solution for performance.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `initialArray = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 2`. The output should be `[1, 4, 9, 16]`.
  - Example 2: `initialArray = [1, 10, 100, 1000]`, `k = 3`. The output should be `[1, 1000, 1000000, 1000000000]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Simply multiply each element in the array `k` times.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over each element in the array.
  2. For each element, multiply it by itself `k` times.
  3. Store the result back in the array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly implements the problem statement without considering performance optimizations.

```cpp
vector<int> finalArrayState(vector<int>& initialArray, int k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < initialArray.size(); i++) {
        long long temp = initialArray[i];
        for (int j = 0; j < k - 1; j++) {
            temp *= initialArray[i];
            if (temp > INT_MAX) {
                initialArray[i] = INT_MAX;
                break;
            }
        }
        initialArray[i] = (int)temp;
    }
    return initialArray;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because for each element in the array, we perform `k` multiplications.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the output, as we modify the input array in-place.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach directly follows the problem statement without optimizing for performance, leading to a time complexity that is linear in both the size of the input array and the number of operations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Recognize that the multiplication operation is independent for each element in the array, and we can use the property of exponentiation to simplify the calculation.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. For each element in the array, calculate its `k`-th power directly using exponentiation.
  2. Handle overflow by checking if the result exceeds the maximum integer value.
- Proof of optimality: This approach optimizes the calculation for each element by directly computing the result of the `k` multiplication operations, reducing the time complexity to linear in the size of the input array.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The problem requires at least reading the input array and writing the result, which already implies a linear time complexity.

```cpp
vector<int> finalArrayState(vector<int>& initialArray, int k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < initialArray.size(); i++) {
        long long result = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            if (result > INT_MAX / initialArray[i]) {
                initialArray[i] = INT_MAX;
                break;
            }
            result *= initialArray[i];
        }
        initialArray[i] = (int)result;
    }
    return initialArray;
}
```

However, a more efficient approach can utilize the property of exponentiation to directly calculate the `k`-th power of each element, which can be more efficient than iterative multiplication, especially for large values of `k`.

```cpp
vector<int> finalArrayState(vector<int>& initialArray, int k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < initialArray.size(); i++) {
        long long result = pow(initialArray[i], k);
        initialArray[i] = (result > INT_MAX) ? INT_MAX : (int)result;
    }
    return initialArray;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot log(k))$, considering the use of `pow` function which typically has a time complexity related to the logarithm of the exponent due to its implementation using exponentiation by squaring or similar algorithms.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space needed for the output, as we modify the input array in-place.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to calculate the `k`-th power of each element, leveraging the efficiency of the `pow` function for exponentiation.
