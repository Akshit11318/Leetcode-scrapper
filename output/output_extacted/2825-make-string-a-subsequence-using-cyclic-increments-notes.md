## Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/make-string-a-subsequence-using-cyclic-increments/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` and a target string `target`.
- Constraints: $1 \leq \text{length of } s \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq \text{length of } target \leq 10^5$.
- Expected Output: Find the minimum number of cyclic increments needed to make `s` a subsequence of `target`.
- Key Requirements: The string `s` can be cyclically incremented, meaning the last character can be incremented to the first character, and the string can be checked as a subsequence in `target` at each increment.
- Example Test Cases: 
  - Input: `s = "abc"`, `target = "abcd"`, Output: `0`
  - Input: `s = "abc"`, `target = "bac"`, Output: `1`

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each possible cyclic increment of `s`, check if it is a subsequence of `target`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all cyclic increments of `s`.
  2. For each increment, check if it is a subsequence of `target`.
  3. Keep track of the minimum number of increments needed.

```cpp
int minIncrements(string s, string target) {
    int n = s.size();
    int minIncrements = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        string cyclicS = s.substr(i) + s.substr(0, i);
        int j = 0, k = 0;
        while (j < target.size() && k < cyclicS.size()) {
            if (target[j] == cyclicS[k]) {
                ++k;
            }
            ++j;
        }
        if (k == cyclicS.size()) {
            minIncrements = min(minIncrements, i);
        }
    }
    return minIncrements == INT_MAX ? -1 : minIncrements;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of `s` and $m$ is the length of `target`, because we generate all cyclic increments of `s` and check each one against `target`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we need to store each cyclic increment of `s`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking all possible cyclic increments of `s` against `target`, resulting in a time complexity that is linear in the lengths of both strings.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use two pointers to track the current position in `s` and `target`, and use a single pass through `s` to find the minimum number of increments needed.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start of `s` and `target`, respectively.
  2. Initialize a variable `minIncrements` to store the minimum number of increments needed.
  3. Iterate through `s` and `target` using the two pointers.
  4. If the current characters match, increment both pointers.
  5. If the current characters do not match, increment the pointer for `s` and update `minIncrements` if necessary.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a time complexity of $O(n + m)$, which is optimal because we must at least read the input strings once.

```cpp
int minIncrements(string s, string target) {
    int n = s.size();
    int m = target.size();
    int minIncrements = 0;
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (j < m) {
        if (i == n) {
            i = 0;
            ++minIncrements;
        }
        if (s[i] == target[j]) {
            ++i;
            ++j;
        } else {
            ++i;
        }
    }
    return minIncrements;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the length of `s` and $m$ is the length of `target`, because we make a single pass through both strings.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the minimum number of increments.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it has a time complexity that is linear in the lengths of the input strings, and we must at least read the input strings once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Two-pointer technique, cyclic increments.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a single pass through the input to find the minimum number of increments needed.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity by using a single pass through the input.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving cyclic increments or two-pointer techniques.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not updating the pointers correctly, not handling the case where `s` is not a subsequence of `target`.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where `s` is empty, the case where `target` is empty.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that has a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases.
