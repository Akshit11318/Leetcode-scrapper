## Find Polygon With the Largest Perimeter
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-polygon-with-the-largest-perimeter/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers where each integer represents the side length of a polygon.
- Constraints: Each side length is a positive integer.
- Expected output format: The largest possible perimeter of a polygon with the given side lengths.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: A polygon can have at least 3 sides, and the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side for a valid polygon.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `[1, 2]`, Output: `0` (No valid polygon can be formed).
  - Input: `[1, 2, 1]`, Output: `0` (No valid polygon can be formed because the sum of the two smallest sides is not greater than the largest side).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of sides to form polygons and calculate their perimeters.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of the given side lengths.
  2. For each combination, check if it can form a valid polygon by ensuring the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
  3. If a combination can form a valid polygon, calculate its perimeter by summing all its sides.
  4. Keep track of the maximum perimeter found.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward method to consider all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int largestPerimeter(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 2; --i) {
        if (nums[i] < nums[i-1] + nums[i-2]) {
            return nums[i] + nums[i-1] + nums[i-2];
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 6, 2, 3};
    std::cout << largestPerimeter(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of sides. This is because in the worst case, we might end up checking all combinations of sides.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, assuming the input is given and we're not counting the space required for the input.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves checking all possible combinations of sides, leading to quadratic time complexity. However, the space complexity remains constant because we're only using a fixed amount of space to store the current combination and the maximum perimeter found.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of trying all combinations, we can start from the largest side and work our way down, checking for valid polygons.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the side lengths in descending order.
  2. Iterate through the sorted array, considering each side as the potential largest side of a polygon.
  3. For each side, check if the sum of the next two sides is greater than it. If so, we've found a valid polygon.
  4. Calculate the perimeter of this polygon and return it as the maximum perimeter.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures that we consider the largest possible polygons first and stops as soon as it finds a valid one, minimizing unnecessary checks.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int largestPerimeter(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), std::greater<int>());
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 2; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] < nums[i+1] + nums[i+2]) {
            return nums[i] + nums[i+1] + nums[i+2];
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 6, 2, 3};
    std::cout << largestPerimeter(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting step, where $n$ is the number of sides.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ if we consider the input array as given and do not count the space required for sorting.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it leverages the fact that a polygon's largest side must be less than the sum of its other two sides. By starting with the largest sides and checking for validity, we minimize the number of checks required to find the maximum perimeter.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, iteration, and conditional checks.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Starting with the most significant elements first can lead to efficient solutions.
- Optimization techniques learned: Leveraging properties of the problem (like the triangle inequality for polygons) to reduce the search space.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases (like an empty input array).
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring the input array has at least three elements to form a polygon.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms (like checking all combinations) for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Always test with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and large datasets.
