## Apple Redistribution into Boxes

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/apple-redistribution-into-boxes/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer array `apples` representing the number of apples in each box and an integer `k` representing the maximum number of apples that can be put in a box.
- Constraints: `1 <= apples.length <= 10^5`, `0 <= apples[i] <= 10^9`, and `0 <= k <= 10^9`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of boxes needed to redistribute the apples.
- Key requirements: Each box must not exceed `k` apples, and all apples must be redistributed.
- Example test cases:
  - `apples = [3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`, `k = 3`: Output `2`.
  - `apples = [6, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 4]`, `k = 4`: Output `4`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate over all possible combinations of redistributing apples into boxes.
- However, this approach quickly becomes infeasible due to the large number of possible combinations.
- A step-by-step breakdown involves calculating the total number of apples, then attempting to distribute them into boxes one by one, ensuring not to exceed `k` apples per box.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement, but it's inefficient due to its combinatorial nature.

```cpp
int minimumBoxes(vector<int>& apples, int k) {
    // Calculate total apples
    long long totalApples = 0;
    for (int apple : apples) {
        totalApples += apple;
    }

    // Initialize boxes count
    int boxes = 0;

    // Attempt distribution
    while (totalApples > 0) {
        int currentBox = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < apples.size(); i++) {
            if (apples[i] > 0) {
                // Try to fill the current box
                if (currentBox + 1 <= k) {
                    currentBox++;
                    apples[i]--;
                    totalApples--;
                }
            }
        }
        // If we filled a box, increment boxes count
        if (currentBox > 0) {
            boxes++;
        } else {
            // If no apples were moved, it's impossible to redistribute
            break;
        }
    }

    return boxes;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot totalApples)$, where $n$ is the number of boxes and $totalApples$ is the total number of apples. This is because in the worst case, we might need to iterate over all apples for each box.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the total apples and the boxes count.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves iterating over the apples for each potential box, leading to high time complexity. The space complexity is low because we only need to keep track of a few variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use a greedy approach to fill the boxes as much as possible without exceeding `k` apples per box.
- We calculate the total number of apples and then divide it by `k` to get the minimum number of boxes needed to hold all the apples without exceeding `k` per box.
- We then consider the remainder of this division, which represents the apples that need to be distributed into additional boxes.
- This approach is optimal because it ensures that we use the minimum number of boxes necessary to hold all the apples without exceeding the limit `k`.

```cpp
int minimumBoxes(vector<int>& apples, int k) {
    long long totalApples = 0;
    for (int apple : apples) {
        totalApples += apple;
    }

    // Calculate minimum boxes needed
    long long minBoxes = (totalApples + k - 1) / k; // Ceiling division

    return minBoxes;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of boxes, because we simply sum up all the apples.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses the minimum number of boxes necessary to hold all the apples without exceeding `k` per box, as proven by the division and ceiling function.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy algorithm, division, and ceiling function.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using division to find the minimum number of groups (boxes) that can hold a certain quantity (apples) without exceeding a limit.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary iterations and using mathematical operations to directly calculate the result.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving distribution or grouping, such as scheduling tasks or allocating resources.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not considering the remainder of the division or not using ceiling division.
- Edge cases to watch for: Zero apples or zero boxes, and ensuring that the division is correctly handled for large numbers.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient algorithms that involve unnecessary iterations.
- Testing considerations: Testing with various inputs, including edge cases and large numbers, to ensure the solution works correctly and efficiently.
