## Minimize XOR of Remaining Elements Using Operations

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-or-of-remaining-elements-using-operations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.
- Expected output: The minimum possible bitwise OR of the remaining elements after applying the operations.
- Key requirements: We can perform the operation of removing any element from the array any number of times.
- Edge cases: The array can contain duplicate elements, and the array can be empty.

**Example Test Cases:**
- For `nums = [1, 0, 3]`, the output should be `0` because we can remove the elements `1` and `3` to get `0`.
- For `nums = [1, 2, 4]`, the output should be `2` because we can remove the elements `1` and `4` to get `2`.
- For `nums = [0, 0, 0]`, the output should be `0` because we can keep any of the elements `0` to get `0`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to try all possible combinations of elements in the array and calculate the bitwise OR for each combination.
- We can use a bitmask to generate all possible subsets of the array.
- For each subset, we calculate the bitwise OR of the elements in the subset.

```cpp
int minimizeOr(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int minOr = INT_MAX;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        int orVal = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                orVal |= nums[i];
            }
        }
        minOr = min(minOr, orVal);
    }
    return minOr;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we are generating all possible subsets of the array, and for each subset, we are calculating the bitwise OR of its elements.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, which means the space required does not change with the size of the input array, making it constant.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are using a bitmask to generate all possible subsets of the array, and for each subset, we are calculating the bitwise OR of its elements. The space complexity is constant because we are only using a fixed amount of space to store the minimum OR value and the current OR value.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is to realize that the bitwise OR operation has a property where `a | b` is greater than or equal to `a` and `b`.
- We can use this property to reduce the problem to finding the minimum element in the array.
- We can sort the array and then find the minimum element.

```cpp
int minimizeOr(vector<int>& nums) {
    int minVal = INT_MAX;
    for (int num : nums) {
        minVal = min(minVal, num);
    }
    return minVal;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we are iterating over the array once to find the minimum element.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, which means the space required does not change with the size of the input array, making it constant.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we are only iterating over the array once to find the minimum element, which is the minimum possible bitwise OR of the remaining elements.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The key algorithmic concept demonstrated is the use of the property of the bitwise OR operation to reduce the problem to finding the minimum element in the array.
- The problem-solving pattern identified is to look for properties of the operations involved in the problem that can be used to simplify the problem.
- The optimization technique learned is to use the property of the bitwise OR operation to reduce the time complexity of the solution.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- A common implementation error is to forget to initialize the minimum OR value to a large value, such as `INT_MAX`.
- An edge case to watch for is when the array is empty, in which case the function should return `0`.
- A performance pitfall is to use a brute force approach that generates all possible subsets of the array, which can lead to a high time complexity.
- A testing consideration is to test the function with arrays of different sizes and with different values to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.
