## Delay the Resolution of Each Promise
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/delay-the-resolution-of-each-promise/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers representing the time delays for each promise.
- Constraints: The input array will contain non-negative integers.
- Expected output format: An array of integers representing the resolution times of each promise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The resolution time of each promise is the time delay plus the resolution time of the previous promise, or 0 if it's the first promise.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the output should be `[1, 3, 6]`, because the resolution time of the first promise is 1, the resolution time of the second promise is 1 + 2 = 3, and the resolution time of the third promise is 3 + 3 = 6.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the resolution time of each promise by adding its time delay to the resolution time of the previous promise.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty array to store the resolution times.
  2. Iterate through the input array, and for each promise, calculate its resolution time by adding its time delay to the resolution time of the previous promise (or 0 if it's the first promise).
  3. Append the calculated resolution time to the result array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it may not be the most efficient solution.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> delayTheResolutionOfEachPromise(std::vector<int>& promises) {
    std::vector<int> resolutionTimes;
    int previousResolutionTime = 0;
    for (int timeDelay : promises) {
        int resolutionTime = previousResolutionTime + timeDelay;
        resolutionTimes.push_back(resolutionTime);
        previousResolutionTime = resolutionTime;
    }
    return resolutionTimes;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of promises, because we iterate through the input array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we create a new array to store the resolution times.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we perform a constant amount of work for each promise, and the space complexity is linear because we store the resolution time of each promise in a new array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be solved using a simple iterative approach, and the optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty array to store the resolution times.
  2. Iterate through the input array, and for each promise, calculate its resolution time by adding its time delay to the resolution time of the previous promise (or 0 if it's the first promise).
  3. Append the calculated resolution time to the result array.
- Proof of optimality: The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$, which is the best possible time complexity because we must iterate through the input array at least once to calculate the resolution times.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The space complexity is $O(n)$, which is the best possible space complexity because we must store the resolution time of each promise in a new array.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> delayTheResolutionOfEachPromise(std::vector<int>& promises) {
    std::vector<int> resolutionTimes;
    int previousResolutionTime = 0;
    for (int timeDelay : promises) {
        int resolutionTime = previousResolutionTime + timeDelay;
        resolutionTimes.push_back(resolutionTime);
        previousResolutionTime = resolutionTime;
    }
    return resolutionTimes;
}
```

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we create a new array to store the resolution times.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iterative approach, simple arithmetic calculations.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be solved using a simple iterative approach.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve iterative approaches and simple arithmetic calculations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to initialize the `previousResolutionTime` variable to 0.
- Edge cases to watch for: None, because the problem statement does not mention any edge cases.
- Performance pitfalls: None, because the optimal solution has a time complexity of $O(n)$.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different input arrays to ensure that it produces the correct output.
