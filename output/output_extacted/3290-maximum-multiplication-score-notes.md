## Maximum Multiplication Score
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-multiplication-score/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem provides an array of integers `nums` and two integers `k` and `p`. The constraints include the size of `nums`, the range of `k`, and the range of `p`.
- Expected output format: The goal is to find the maximum score that can be achieved by multiplying `k` numbers from `nums` and then adding `p` to the result.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The problem requires handling cases where `k` is 0, `p` is 0, or `nums` is empty. Additionally, the problem involves finding the maximum score, which implies considering all possible combinations of `k` numbers from `nums`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For instance, given `nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 2, p = 1`, the maximum score can be achieved by multiplying 2 and 3, then adding 1, resulting in a score of 7.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to generate all possible combinations of `k` numbers from `nums`, calculate the product of each combination, and then find the maximum score by adding `p` to each product.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all combinations of `k` numbers from `nums`.
  2. For each combination, calculate the product of its numbers.
  3. Add `p` to each product to get the score.
  4. Find the maximum score among all combinations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward method that considers all possibilities, ensuring that the maximum score is found.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int maximumScore(std::vector<int>& nums, int k, int p) {
    // Initialize maximum score
    int maxScore = INT_MIN;

    // Generate all combinations of k numbers from nums
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << nums.size()); ++i) {
        std::vector<int> combination;
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
            if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                combination.push_back(nums[j]);
            }
        }

        // Check if the combination has k numbers
        if (combination.size() == k) {
            // Calculate the product of the combination
            int product = 1;
            for (int num : combination) {
                product *= num;
            }

            // Calculate the score by adding p to the product
            int score = product + p;

            // Update the maximum score
            maxScore = std::max(maxScore, score);
        }
    }

    return maxScore;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the size of `nums`. This is because we generate all combinations of `nums` and for each combination of size `k`, we calculate the product.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, as we need to store the current combination of `k` numbers.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high due to generating all combinations, and the space complexity is relatively low since we only store one combination at a time.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves using a priority queue to efficiently find the maximum score. However, given the nature of this problem, the optimal approach actually aligns closely with the brute force in terms of complexity due to the necessity of considering all combinations for the maximum score. The optimization in the optimal approach would typically involve more efficient algorithms for generating combinations or calculating products, but such optimizations are limited in this context.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: Since the problem inherently requires examining all combinations of `k` elements from `nums`, the optimal approach in terms of algorithmic complexity (time and space) does not significantly differ from the brute force for this specific problem statement. However, in practice, optimizations could involve using more efficient data structures or algorithms for combination generation and product calculation.
- Proof of optimality: The optimality in this context is proven by the fact that any algorithm must at least consider all combinations of `k` numbers from `nums` to find the maximum score, leading to a similar time complexity as the brute force approach.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int maximumScore(std::vector<int>& nums, int k, int p) {
    // Initialize maximum score
    int maxScore = INT_MIN;

    // Generate all combinations of k numbers from nums
    std::vector<bool> used(nums.size(), false);
    std::function<void(int, std::vector<int>&)> backtrack = [&](int start, std::vector<int>& current) {
        if (current.size() == k) {
            // Calculate the product of the current combination
            int product = 1;
            for (int num : current) {
                product *= num;
            }

            // Calculate the score by adding p to the product
            int score = product + p;

            // Update the maximum score
            maxScore = std::max(maxScore, score);
        } else {
            for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
                if (!used[i]) {
                    used[i] = true;
                    current.push_back(nums[i]);
                    backtrack(i + 1, current);
                    current.pop_back();
                    used[i] = false;
                }
            }
        }
    };

    std::vector<int> current;
    backtrack(0, current);

    return maxScore;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(C(n, k) \cdot k)$, where $C(n, k)$ is the number of combinations of `n` items taken `k` at a time, and $k$ accounts for the time to calculate the product of each combination. This simplifies to $O(2^n \cdot k)$ in the worst case when $k = n/2$, but for specific values of $k$ and $n$, the actual time complexity can be lower.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, for storing the current combination of `k` numbers.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because any algorithm must consider all combinations of `k` numbers from `nums` to find the maximum score. The space complexity is also optimal as we only need to store one combination at a time.
