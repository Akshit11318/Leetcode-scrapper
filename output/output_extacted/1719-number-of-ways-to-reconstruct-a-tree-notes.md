## Number of Ways to Reconstruct a Tree
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reconstruct-a-tree/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `n`, the number of nodes in the tree, and `edges`, a list of edges in the tree.
- Expected output: The number of ways to reconstruct the tree.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The tree is a connected, undirected graph.
  - The tree has no cycles.
  - The tree has `n` nodes.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `n = 3` and `edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]`, the output should be `2`.
  - For `n =4` and `edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]`, the output should be `6`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can generate all possible trees with `n` nodes and check if they are isomorphic to the given tree.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible trees with `n` nodes.
  2. Check if each tree is isomorphic to the given tree.
  3. Count the number of isomorphic trees.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that checks all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to check if two trees are isomorphic
bool isIsomorphic(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& tree1, const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& tree2) {
    // Check if the trees have the same number of nodes
    if (tree1.size() != tree2.size()) return false;

    // Check if the trees have the same edges
    for (int i = 0; i < tree1.size(); i++) {
        if (tree1[i].size() != tree2[i].size()) return false;
        for (int j = 0; j < tree1[i].size(); j++) {
            if (tree1[i][j] != tree2[i][j]) return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

// Function to generate all possible trees with n nodes
void generateTrees(int n, std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>>& trees) {
    if (n == 1) {
        trees.push_back({{0}});
        return;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>> leftTrees;
        generateTrees(i - 1, leftTrees);

        std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>> rightTrees;
        generateTrees(n - i, rightTrees);

        for (const auto& leftTree : leftTrees) {
            for (const auto& rightTree : rightTrees) {
                std::vector<std::vector<int>> tree(n);
                for (int j = 0; j < i - 1; j++) {
                    tree[j] = leftTree[j];
                }

                for (int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {
                    tree[i + j] = rightTree[j];
                }

                tree[i - 1].push_back(n - 1);
                trees.push_back(tree);
            }
        }
    }
}

int numWaysToReconstructTree(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& edges) {
    std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>> trees;
    generateTrees(n, trees);

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> tree(n);
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        tree[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        tree[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }

    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& t : trees) {
        if (isIsomorphic(t, tree)) count++;
    }

    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n!)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we generate all possible trees with $n$ nodes and check if each tree is isomorphic to the given tree.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we store all possible trees with $n$ nodes.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we generate all possible trees with $n$ nodes and check if each tree is isomorphic to the given tree.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the concept of `Prüfer sequences` to count the number of ways to reconstruct the tree.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Generate the `Prüfer sequence` for the given tree.
  2. Count the number of ways to reconstruct the tree using the `Prüfer sequence`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a one-to-one correspondence between the tree and its `Prüfer sequence`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Function to generate the Prüfer sequence for a tree
std::vector<int> pruferSequence(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& tree) {
    std::vector<int> sequence;
    std::vector<bool> visited(tree.size(), false);

    for (int i = 0; i < tree.size() - 2; i++) {
        int minLeaf = -1;
        for (int j = 0; j < tree.size(); j++) {
            if (!visited[j] && tree[j].size() == 1) {
                if (minLeaf == -1 || j < minLeaf) minLeaf = j;
            }
        }

        sequence.push_back(tree[minLeaf][0]);
        visited[minLeaf] = true;
    }

    return sequence;
}

// Function to count the number of ways to reconstruct a tree using a Prüfer sequence
int numWaysToReconstructTree(const std::vector<int>& sequence) {
    int n = sequence.size() + 2;
    return 1;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: `Prüfer sequences`, tree reconstruction.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a one-to-one correspondence between a tree and its `Prüfer sequence`.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a `Prüfer sequence` to count the number of ways to reconstruct a tree.
- Similar problems to practice: Tree reconstruction problems, `Prüfer sequence` problems.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly generating the `Prüfer sequence`, incorrectly counting the number of ways to reconstruct the tree.
- Edge cases to watch for: Trees with a single node, trees with two nodes.
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient algorithm to generate the `Prüfer sequence` or count the number of ways to reconstruct the tree.
- Testing considerations: Test the implementation with different tree sizes, test the implementation with different tree structures.
