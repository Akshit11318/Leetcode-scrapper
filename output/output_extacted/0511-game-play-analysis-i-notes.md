## Game Play Analysis I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves analyzing game play data from two tables: `Activity` and `Players`. The `Activity` table has columns `player_id`, `device_id`, `event_date`, and `games_played`, while the `Players` table has columns `player_id` and `join_date`. The goal is to write a SQL query to calculate the number of players who first played the game on each day.
- Expected output format: The output should be a table with a single column `event_date` representing the date and another column `first_play` representing the number of players who first played the game on that date.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The query needs to handle cases where a player may have played the game on multiple days, and only the first play date should be considered.
- Example test cases with explanations: For instance, if the `Activity` table contains records for a player on multiple days, the query should only count the earliest record as the first play.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves using a subquery to find the first play date for each player and then grouping the results by date to count the number of first plays.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Identify the first play date for each player by selecting the minimum `event_date` from the `Activity` table for each `player_id`.
  2. Group the first play dates by `event_date` and count the number of players for each date.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement by focusing on finding the first play date for each player and then aggregating these dates.

```cpp
SELECT 
    a.event_date, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id) AS first_play
FROM 
    (
    SELECT 
        player_id, 
        MIN(event_date) AS event_date
    FROM 
        Activity
    GROUP BY 
        player_id
    ) a
GROUP BY 
    a.event_date
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to the grouping and sorting operations, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Activity` table.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the intermediate results of the subquery.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the grouping and sorting operations in the subquery and the outer query. The space complexity is due to the need to store the intermediate results of the subquery.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of using a subquery to find the first play date for each player, we can use a `JOIN` operation with the `Players` table to filter players based on their join date and then find the first play date.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Join the `Activity` table with the `Players` table on `player_id`.
  2. Filter the joined table to include only rows where the `event_date` is greater than or equal to the `join_date`.
  3. Use a subquery or window function to find the first play date for each player.
  4. Group the results by `event_date` and count the number of first plays.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly addresses the problem statement and minimizes the number of operations required to find the first play date for each player.

```cpp
SELECT 
    a.event_date, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id) AS first_play
FROM 
    (
    SELECT 
        a.player_id, 
        MIN(a.event_date) AS event_date
    FROM 
        Activity a
    JOIN 
        Players p ON a.player_id = p.player_id
    WHERE 
        a.event_date = (SELECT MIN(event_date) FROM Activity WHERE player_id = a.player_id)
    GROUP BY 
        a.player_id
    ) a
GROUP BY 
    a.event_date
```

However, using a window function can simplify this:

```cpp
SELECT 
    event_date, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) AS first_play
FROM 
    (
    SELECT 
        player_id, 
        event_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) AS rn
    FROM 
        Activity
    ) a
WHERE 
    rn = 1
GROUP BY 
    event_date
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting operation in the window function, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Activity` table.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing the intermediate results of the window function.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because it minimizes the number of operations required to find the first play date for each player and groups the results by date.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Using window functions to find the first occurrence of an event for each group.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and using subqueries or window functions to solve them.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minimizing the number of operations required to solve the problem.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve finding the first or last occurrence of an event for each group.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not considering the join date when finding the first play date for each player.
- Edge cases to watch for: Players who have multiple first play dates due to different devices or games.
- Performance pitfalls: Using inefficient subqueries or not indexing the columns used in the `JOIN` and `WHERE` clauses.
- Testing considerations: Testing the query with different datasets and edge cases to ensure it produces the correct results.
