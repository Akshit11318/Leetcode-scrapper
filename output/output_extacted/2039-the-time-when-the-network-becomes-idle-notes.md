## The Time When the Network Becomes Idle
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/the-time-when-the-network-becomes-idle/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer `edges` representing the number of edges in the network and an integer `patience` representing the patience of each data packet.
- Constraints: `1 <= edges.length <= 5 * 10^4`, `1 <= patience.length == edges.length`.
- Expected output format: The earliest time when the network becomes idle.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The network is initially idle.
  - Each data packet is sent at time `0` and has a patience level.
  - Each edge represents a connection between two nodes and has a travel time.
  - The network becomes idle when all data packets have been sent and have not been sent again.

Example test cases with explanations:
- `edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1]]`, `patience = [0,2,1]`. The earliest time when the network becomes idle is `8`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Simulate the network and its data packets over time.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a queue with all nodes that have data packets.
  2. For each time unit, process all nodes in the queue:
     - Send the data packet if its patience level allows it.
     - Add the neighboring nodes to the queue if the data packet is sent.
  3. Continue until the queue is empty and all data packets have been sent.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int networkBecomesIdle(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& patience) {
    int n = patience.size();
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }

    int time = 0;
    queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (patience[i] != 0) {
            q.push(i);
        }
    }

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (patience[node] != 0) {
                patience[node]--;
                for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                    if (patience[neighbor] != 0) {
                        patience[neighbor]--;
                    } else {
                        q.push(neighbor);
                        patience[neighbor] = patience[node];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        time++;
    }

    return time;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot p)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes, $m$ is the maximum number of neighbors for a node, and $p$ is the maximum patience level. This is because in the worst case, we need to process each node and its neighbors for each time unit until the network becomes idle.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of edges. This is because we need to store the graph and the queue.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach simulates the network over time, which leads to high time complexity. The space complexity is relatively low because we only need to store the graph and the queue.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of simulating the network over time, we can calculate the time when each node will become idle based on its patience level and the travel time of its edges.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the shortest distance from each node to the source node (node 0) using a BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm.
  2. For each node, calculate the time when it will become idle based on its patience level and the shortest distance to the source node.
  3. The earliest time when the network becomes idle is the maximum of the times calculated in step 2.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int networkBecomesIdle(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& patience) {
    int n = patience.size();
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n);
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        graph[edge[0]].push_back({edge[1], edge[2]});
        graph[edge[1]].push_back({edge[0], edge[2]});
    }

    vector<int> distance(n, INT_MAX);
    distance[0] = 0;
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(0);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for (auto& neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (distance[neighbor.first] > distance[node] + neighbor.second) {
                distance[neighbor.first] = distance[node] + neighbor.second;
                q.push(neighbor.first);
            }
        }
    }

    int maxTime = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (patience[i] != 0) {
            int time = (patience[i] - 1) / patience[i] * 2 * distance[i] + distance[i];
            maxTime = max(maxTime, time);
        }
    }

    return maxTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of edges. This is because we need to perform a BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distances.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of edges. This is because we need to store the graph and the distances.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it calculates the time when each node will become idle based on its patience level and the shortest distance to the source node, which is the minimum time required for the network to become idle.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and graph traversal.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: calculating the time when a system becomes idle based on its components' patience levels and travel times.
- Optimization techniques learned: using BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distances and reducing the time complexity from $O(n \cdot m \cdot p)$ to $O(n + m)$.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not handling the case where a node has no patience level or not calculating the shortest distances correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: nodes with zero patience level or nodes with no edges.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach that simulates the network over time, leading to high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: testing the algorithm with different inputs and edge cases to ensure correctness and efficiency.
