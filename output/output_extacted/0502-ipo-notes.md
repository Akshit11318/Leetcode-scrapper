## Initial Public Offering (IPO)
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves finding the maximum capital that can be achieved by investing in a list of projects, each with a capital requirement and a profit. The input includes the number of projects (`k`), the maximum capital (`W`), and the list of projects (`profits` and `capital`).
- Expected output format: The function should return the maximum capital that can be achieved.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The function should handle cases where the number of projects is 0 or the maximum capital is 0.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if there are two projects with capital requirements of 0 and 1, and profits of 1 and 2, respectively, and the maximum capital is 0, the function should return 0.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves trying all possible combinations of projects and calculating the maximum capital that can be achieved.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of projects.
  2. For each combination, calculate the total capital required and the total profit.
  3. If the total capital required is less than or equal to the maximum capital, update the maximum capital that can be achieved.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and involves trying all possible solutions.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int W, std::vector<int>& profits, std::vector<int>& capital) {
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> projects;
    for (int i = 0; i < profits.size(); i++) {
        projects.push_back({capital[i], profits[i]});
    }
    std::sort(projects.begin(), projects.end());
    
    int maxCapital = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << profits.size()); i++) {
        int totalCapital = 0;
        int totalProfit = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < profits.size(); j++) {
            if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                totalCapital += projects[j].first;
                totalProfit += projects[j].second;
            }
        }
        if (totalCapital <= W && totalProfit > maxCapital && k >= countBits(i)) {
            maxCapital = totalProfit;
        }
    }
    return maxCapital;
}

int countBits(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n) {
        count += n & 1;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of projects. This is because we are generating all possible combinations of projects and calculating the total capital required and the total profit for each combination.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of projects. This is because we are storing the projects in a vector.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are trying all possible combinations of projects, which results in exponential time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a priority queue to store the projects that can be invested in, sorted by their profits in descending order.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a priority queue to store the projects that can be invested in.
  2. Iterate over the projects and add them to the priority queue if their capital requirement is less than or equal to the maximum capital.
  3. While the priority queue is not empty and we can still invest in projects, remove the project with the highest profit from the priority queue and add its profit to the maximum capital.
  4. Update the maximum capital and repeat steps 2-3 until we have invested in all possible projects.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we are always investing in the project with the highest profit that we can afford, which maximizes the total profit.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int W, std::vector<int>& profits, std::vector<int>& capital) {
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> projects;
    for (int i = 0; i < profits.size(); i++) {
        projects.push_back({capital[i], profits[i]});
    }
    std::sort(projects.begin(), projects.end());
    
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;
    int i = 0;
    int maxCapital = 0;
    
    for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
        while (i < projects.size() && projects[i].first <= W) {
            pq.push(projects[i].second);
            i++;
        }
        if (pq.empty()) break;
        maxCapital += pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        W += maxCapital;
    }
    return maxCapital;
}
```

> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + k \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of projects. This is because we are sorting the projects and using a priority queue to store the projects that can be invested in.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy algorithm, priority queue, sorting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a priority queue to store the projects that can be invested in, sorted by their profits in descending order.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a priority queue to optimize the solution, sorting the projects to reduce the time complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve investing in projects with different capital requirements and profits.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not handling the case where the number of projects is 0 or the maximum capital is 0.
- Edge cases to watch for: The case where the number of projects is 0 or the maximum capital is 0.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that tries all possible combinations of projects, which results in exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
