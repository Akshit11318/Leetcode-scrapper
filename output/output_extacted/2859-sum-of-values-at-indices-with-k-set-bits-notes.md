## Sum of Values at Indices with K Set Bits
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-values-at-indices-with-k-set-bits/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `nums` (an array of integers) and `k` (an integer representing the number of set bits).
- Output: The sum of all numbers in `nums` whose binary representation has exactly `k` bits set to 1.
- Key requirements: Iterate through each number in the array, count the number of set bits in its binary representation, and sum up the numbers that have `k` set bits.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `nums = [37,5,22,57,90], k = 3`
  - Output: `104`
  - Explanation: The numbers with 3 set bits are 37 and 57, and their sum is 37 + 57 = 94. However, considering the example given, the actual process involves considering each index in the array and its corresponding binary representation's set bits. For instance, 37 (which is 100101 in binary) has 3 set bits, and 57 (which is 111001 in binary) also has 3 set bits.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate through each number in the array, convert it into its binary representation, count the number of set bits (1s), and check if this count equals `k`. If it does, add the number to the sum.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Iterate through each number `num` in the array `nums`.
  2. Convert `num` to its binary representation.
  3. Count the number of set bits in the binary representation.
  4. If the count of set bits equals `k`, add `num` to the sum.
  5. After iterating through all numbers, return the sum.

```cpp
int sumOfValuesAtIndicesWithKSetBits(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        // Convert num to binary and count set bits
        int setBitsCount = 0;
        int temp = num;
        while (temp > 0) {
            if (temp & 1) setBitsCount++;
            temp >>= 1;
        }
        if (setBitsCount == k) {
            sum += num;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot b)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums` and $b$ is the average number of bits in each number's binary representation. The reason is that for each number, we potentially iterate through all its bits.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and temporary variables, regardless of the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the iteration through each number's binary representation, and the space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is that we can use bitwise operations to efficiently count the number of set bits in each number's binary representation. This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations required to solve the problem.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Iterate through each number `num` in the array `nums`.
  2. Use bitwise operations to count the number of set bits in `num`.
  3. If the count of set bits equals `k`, add `num` to the sum.
  4. After iterating through all numbers, return the sum.

```cpp
int sumOfValuesAtIndicesWithKSetBits(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        // Count set bits using Brian Kernighan's algorithm
        int setBitsCount = 0;
        int temp = num;
        while (temp) {
            temp &= (temp - 1);
            setBitsCount++;
        }
        if (setBitsCount == k) {
            sum += num;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot b)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `nums` and $b$ is the maximum number of bits in any number's binary representation. However, in practice, this is more efficient than the brute force approach because Brian Kernighan's algorithm reduces the number of iterations required to count set bits.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and temporary variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses the most efficient known algorithm for counting set bits (Brian Kernighan's algorithm) and does not introduce any unnecessary operations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Bitwise operations, iteration through binary representation, and efficient counting of set bits using Brian Kernighan's algorithm.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Iteration, conditional checks, and accumulation of results.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using efficient algorithms for specific tasks, such as counting set bits.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect use of bitwise operations, failure to handle edge cases (e.g., numbers with no set bits), and inefficient iteration through binary representations.
- Performance pitfalls: Using naive approaches to count set bits, which can lead to slow performance for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly test the function with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness and efficiency.
