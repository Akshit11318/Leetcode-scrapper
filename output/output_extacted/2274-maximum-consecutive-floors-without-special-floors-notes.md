## Maximum Consecutive Floors Without Special Floors

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-consecutive-floors-without-special-floors/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: We are given two integers `top` and `bottom`, representing the range of floors in a building, and a list of special floors `special`.
- Expected output format: The maximum number of consecutive floors without special floors.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: We need to handle cases where the input range is empty, or the special floors list is empty, or when all floors are special.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `top = 2, bottom = 1, special = [1]`, Output: `1` (The floor `2` is the only non-special floor).
  - Input: `top = 6, bottom = 2, special = [6, 4, 2, 3]`, Output: `0` (All floors in the range are special).
  - Input: `top = 2, bottom = 2, special = []`, Output: `1` (The floor `2` is not special).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We start by iterating over each floor in the range from `bottom` to `top`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable `maxConsecutive` to store the maximum number of consecutive non-special floors found so far.
  2. Initialize another variable `currentConsecutive` to keep track of the current sequence of non-special floors.
  3. Iterate over each floor in the range. For each floor:
    - Check if the floor is special by searching for it in the `special` list.
    - If the floor is not special, increment `currentConsecutive`.
    - If the floor is special, update `maxConsecutive` if `currentConsecutive` is greater, and reset `currentConsecutive`.
  4. After iterating over all floors, perform one final check to update `maxConsecutive` if `currentConsecutive` is greater.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that checks each floor individually and keeps track of sequences of non-special floors.

```cpp
int maxConsecutiveFloors(int top, int bottom, vector<int>& special) {
    int maxConsecutive = 0;
    int currentConsecutive = 0;
    for (int i = bottom; i <= top; ++i) {
        bool isSpecial = false;
        for (int specialFloor : special) {
            if (i == specialFloor) {
                isSpecial = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!isSpecial) {
            currentConsecutive++;
        } else {
            maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive);
            currentConsecutive = 0;
        }
    }
    maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive);
    return maxConsecutive;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the range of floors (`top - bottom + 1`) and $m$ is the number of special floors, because in the worst case, we iterate over each floor and for each floor, we might iterate over all special floors to check if it's special.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space to store our variables, regardless of the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because of the nested loop structure, where the outer loop iterates over all floors, and the inner loop checks if a floor is special by iterating over all special floors.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of checking for each floor if it's special by iterating over the `special` list, we can first sort the `special` list. Then, we can use a single pass through the floors and a binary search to check if a floor is special, significantly reducing the time complexity.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the `special` list in ascending order.
  2. Initialize `maxConsecutive` and `currentConsecutive` as before.
  3. Iterate over each floor in the range. For each floor:
    - Use binary search to check if the floor is in the `special` list.
    - If the floor is not special, increment `currentConsecutive`.
    - If the floor is special, update `maxConsecutive` if `currentConsecutive` is greater, and reset `currentConsecutive`.
  4. Perform the final check to update `maxConsecutive` after iterating over all floors.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it reduces the time complexity of checking if a floor is special from linear to logarithmic, resulting in an overall time complexity that is linear with respect to the range of floors and logarithmic with respect to the number of special floors.

```cpp
int maxConsecutiveFloors(int top, int bottom, vector<int>& special) {
    sort(special.begin(), special.end());
    int maxConsecutive = 0;
    int currentConsecutive = 0;
    for (int i = bottom; i <= top; ++i) {
        if (binary_search(special.begin(), special.end(), i)) {
            maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive);
            currentConsecutive = 0;
        } else {
            currentConsecutive++;
        }
    }
    maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive);
    return maxConsecutive;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \log(m) + m \cdot \log(m))$, where $n$ is the range of floors and $m$ is the number of special floors. The first term accounts for the iteration over all floors and the binary search for each, and the second term accounts for the sorting of the special floors list.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we use a constant amount of space for our variables, and the sorting is done in-place.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because we have reduced the time complexity of checking for special floors from linear to logarithmic, and we only iterate over the range of floors once, making the overall time complexity as low as possible given the constraints of the problem.
