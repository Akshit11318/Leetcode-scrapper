## Maximize Area of Square Hole in Grid

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-area-of-square-hole-in-grid/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A 2D grid of size `m x n` filled with `1`s and `0`s, where `1` represents a solid cell and `0` represents an empty cell.
- Constraints: `1 <= m, n <= 1000`, `m` and `n` are integers.
- Expected Output: The maximum area of a square hole that can be formed in the grid.
- Key Requirements: The square hole must be entirely within the grid and cannot overlap with any solid cells.
- Edge Cases: Grids with no empty cells, grids with only one empty cell, grids where no square hole can be formed.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible position in the grid to see if a square hole can be formed.
- We start by iterating over each cell in the grid.
- For each cell, we check if it's empty and if a square hole can be formed with that cell as the top-left corner.
- We try all possible sizes of squares, from `1x1` to the maximum possible size based on the grid dimensions and the position of the cell.

```cpp
int maxSquareHole(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int maxArea = 0;
    
    // Iterate over each cell in the grid
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // Check if the cell is empty
            if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                // Try all possible sizes of squares
                for (int size = 1; size <= min(m - i, n - j); size++) {
                    // Check if a square hole can be formed
                    bool valid = true;
                    for (int x = i; x < i + size; x++) {
                        for (int y = j; y < j + size; y++) {
                            if (x >= m || y >= n || grid[x][y] == 1) {
                                valid = false;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                        if (!valid) break;
                    }
                    // Update the maximum area if a valid square hole is found
                    if (valid) maxArea = max(maxArea, size * size);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n \cdot \min(m, n)^2)$, because for each cell, we're trying all possible sizes of squares and checking each cell within that square.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we're only using a constant amount of space to store the maximum area and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity due to the nested loops and the fact that we're checking every possible position and size for a square hole.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal solution involves using a more efficient algorithm to check for valid square holes.
- We can use a prefix sum array to keep track of the sum of solid cells in each row and column.
- This allows us to quickly check if a square hole can be formed by checking the sum of solid cells in the corresponding rows and columns.

```cpp
int maxSquareHole(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int maxArea = 0;
    
    // Calculate prefix sum for rows
    vector<vector<int>> rowSum(m, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            rowSum[i][j] = rowSum[i][j - 1] + grid[i][j - 1];
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate prefix sum for columns
    vector<vector<int>> colSum(n, vector<int>(m + 1, 0));
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            colSum[j][i] = colSum[j][i - 1] + grid[i - 1][j];
        }
    }
    
    // Iterate over each cell in the grid
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // Check if the cell is empty
            if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                // Try all possible sizes of squares
                for (int size = 1; size <= min(m - i, n - j); size++) {
                    // Check if a square hole can be formed using prefix sum
                    bool valid = true;
                    for (int x = i; x < i + size; x++) {
                        if (rowSum[x][j + size] - rowSum[x][j] != 0) {
                            valid = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    if (!valid) continue;
                    for (int y = j; y < j + size; y++) {
                        if (colSum[y][i + size] - colSum[y][i] != 0) {
                            valid = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    // Update the maximum area if a valid square hole is found
                    if (valid) maxArea = max(maxArea, size * size);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}
```
