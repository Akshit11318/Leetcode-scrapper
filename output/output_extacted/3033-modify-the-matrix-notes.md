## Modify the Matrix
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/modify-the-matrix/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: `n`, the number of rows and columns in the matrix, and `operations`, a list of operations where each operation is either `"Increment"` or `"Decrement"`.
- Expected output format: The final state of the matrix after applying all operations.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
    - `1 <= n <= 100`
    - `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
    - The operations will only be `"Increment"` or `"Decrement"`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given `n = 3` and `operations = ["Increment","Decrement","Increment"]`, the output should be `[[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]` because we start with a matrix of all zeros, increment all elements, then decrement all elements, and finally increment all elements again.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We can solve this problem by iterating through each operation and applying it to the entire matrix.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Initialize a matrix of zeros with size `n x n`.
    2. For each operation in `operations`, if the operation is `"Increment"`, increment all elements in the matrix by 1. If the operation is `"Decrement"`, decrement all elements in the matrix by 1.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows the problem statement and applies each operation to the entire matrix.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> modifyMatrix(int n, vector<string>& operations) {
    // Initialize the matrix with zeros
    vector<vector<int>> matrix(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    // Apply each operation to the matrix
    for (const string& op : operations) {
        if (op == "Increment") {
            // Increment all elements in the matrix
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    matrix[i][j]++;
                }
            }
        } else if (op == "Decrement") {
            // Decrement all elements in the matrix
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    matrix[i][j]--;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return matrix;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the size of the matrix and $m$ is the number of operations, because for each operation, we potentially update the entire matrix.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, because we need to store the matrix of size $n \times n$.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the nested loops that iterate over the matrix for each operation, and the space complexity is due to the storage of the matrix itself.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Since all operations are either incrementing or decrementing all elements in the matrix, we can simply count the net number of increments and apply this to the matrix once.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Count the number of `"Increment"` operations and subtract the number of `"Decrement"` operations to get the net change.
    2. Apply this net change to the matrix by adding the net change to each element.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of operations performed on the matrix, reducing the time complexity significantly.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> modifyMatrixOptimal(int n, vector<string>& operations) {
    // Count the net number of increments
    int netChange = 0;
    for (const string& op : operations) {
        if (op == "Increment") {
            netChange++;
        } else if (op == "Decrement") {
            netChange--;
        }
    }
    
    // Apply the net change to the matrix
    vector<vector<int>> matrix(n, vector<int>(n, netChange));
    
    return matrix;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m + n^2)$, where $m$ is the number of operations and $n$ is the size of the matrix, because we first count the net change in $O(m)$ time and then fill the matrix in $O(n^2)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, because we need to store the matrix of size $n \times n$.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we have reduced the dependency on the number of operations when applying changes to the matrix, making the solution more efficient for large inputs.
