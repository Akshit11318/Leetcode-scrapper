## Check if There is a Valid Parentheses String Path
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-there-is-a-valid-parentheses-string-path/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a grid of size `m x n`, and a string `s` containing only parentheses `(` and `)`. The goal is to check if there exists a path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell such that the string `s` forms a valid sequence of parentheses when read from left to right, where each cell in the grid can either be `(` or `)`.
- Expected output format: Return `true` if such a path exists; otherwise, return `false`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: A valid sequence of parentheses means that every `(` can be matched with a corresponding `)` that appears after it. Also, consider cases where the grid is empty, or the string `s` is empty, or the length of `s` does not match the number of cells in the grid.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For a grid of size `1x1` with the string `s = "()"`, the function should return `true` because there exists a path (the only path) that forms a valid sequence of parentheses.
  - For a grid of size `2x2` with the string `s = "(()"`, the function should return `false` because there is no path that forms a valid sequence of parentheses.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to try all possible paths from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell and check if any of these paths, when combined with the string `s`, form a valid sequence of parentheses.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Define a recursive function or use backtracking to explore all possible paths in the grid.
  2. For each path, append the corresponding parentheses from `s` as you traverse the grid.
  3. After reaching the end of a path, check if the resulting string of parentheses is valid.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's straightforward to understand and implement, especially for those familiar with backtracking problems.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool isValid(const string& s) {
    int balance = 0;
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '(') balance++;
        else balance--;
        if (balance < 0) return false;
    }
    return balance == 0;
}

bool hasValidPath(vector<vector<char>>& grid, string s) {
    int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
    if (m * n != s.length()) return false;
    
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
    
    function<bool(int, int, int, string)> dfs = 
    [&](int x, int y, int index, string path) {
        if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || visited[x][y] || index >= s.length()) return false;
        path += s[index];
        if (index == s.length() - 1) {
            return isValid(path);
        }
        
        visited[x][y] = true;
        for (auto& dir : directions) {
            if (dfs(x + dir.first, y + dir.second, index + 1, path)) return true;
        }
        visited[x][y] = false;
        return false;
    };
    
    return dfs(0, 0, 0, "");
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(4^{m \cdot n})$, because in the worst case, we might explore all four directions for every cell in the grid.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, due to the recursion stack and the `visited` grid.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The exponential time complexity is due to the brute-force exploration of all paths, and the space complexity is a result of storing the visited cells and the recursion stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of exploring all paths and checking their validity, we can use a more directed approach by leveraging the properties of valid parentheses sequences and the structure of the grid.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Observe that a valid path must end with a sequence of `)` that matches the preceding `(`. This means we can start from the end of the path and work our way backward.
  2. Since we're looking for a path that forms a valid sequence of parentheses, we can use a stack to keep track of the balance of `(` and `)` as we traverse the grid.
  3. Start from the bottom-right corner and explore paths backward. For each cell, if it's a `)`, push it onto the stack. If it's a `(`, check if the stack is empty (indicating an imbalance) or pop the corresponding `)` from the stack.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is optimal because it directly addresses the requirement for a valid sequence of parentheses and does so in a manner that avoids unnecessary explorations.

```cpp
bool hasValidPath(vector<vector<char>>& grid, string s) {
    int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
    if (m * n != s.length()) return false;
    
    function<bool(int, int, int)> dfs = 
    [&](int x, int y, int index) {
        if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || index < 0) return false;
        if (index == 0) return true; // Base case: reached the start of the string
        
        for (auto& dir : {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}}) {
            int nx = x + dir.first, ny = y + dir.second;
            if (nx < 0 || nx >= m || ny < 0 || ny >= n) continue;
            
            if (s[index - 1] == '(') { // If current char is '(', try to move to a ')'
                if (grid[nx][ny] == ')') {
                    if (dfs(nx, ny, index - 1)) return true;
                }
            } else { // If current char is ')', try to move to a '('
                if (grid[nx][ny] == '(') {
                    if (dfs(nx, ny, index - 1)) return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    };
    
    return dfs(m - 1, n - 1, s.length());
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(4^{m \cdot n})$, because in the worst case, we still might explore all four directions for every cell in the grid. However, the approach is more directed and efficient in practice.

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it leverages the properties of valid parentheses sequences and the grid structure to directly find a valid path without unnecessary explorations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Backtracking, depth-first search (DFS), and the use of stacks for tracking balances.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down complex problems into simpler, more manageable parts, and using recursion to explore different paths.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using more directed approaches and leveraging problem-specific properties to reduce unnecessary explorations.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not properly handling edge cases (e.g., empty grid or string), and not correctly implementing the backtracking or DFS logic.
- Edge cases to watch for: Grids or strings of size 0, and paths that do not form valid sequences of parentheses.
- Performance pitfalls: Exploring all possible paths without considering the properties of valid parentheses sequences, leading to inefficient solutions.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the solution with various grid sizes, string lengths, and combinations of `(` and `)` to ensure correctness.
