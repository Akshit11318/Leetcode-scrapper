## Rearrange Products Table
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-products-table/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A table `Products` with columns `product_id`, `store`, and `store_name`.
- Constraints: Each store can have multiple products, but each product can only be in one store.
- Expected output format: A table with columns `product_id`, `store`, and `store_name`, where each product is associated with its corresponding store and store name.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - A product can only be in one store.
  - The output should include all products from the input table.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If a product is not in any store, it should not be included in the output.
  - If a store has no products, it should not be included in the output.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Iterate through each product in the `Products` table and find its corresponding store and store name.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create an empty result table.
  2. Iterate through each row in the `Products` table.
  3. For each product, find its corresponding store and store name.
  4. Add the product, store, and store name to the result table.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that checks each product individually.

```cpp
SELECT 
  p.product_id,
  s.store,
  s.store_name
FROM 
  Products p
JOIN 
  Stores s ON p.store = s.store
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of products and $m$ is the number of stores. This is because in the worst case, we might have to check each product against each store.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of products. This is because we need to store the result table.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we are using a join operation, which can be expensive for large tables. The space complexity is moderate because we need to store the result table.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a `JOIN` operation to combine the `Products` table with the `Stores` table based on the `store` column.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use a `JOIN` operation to combine the `Products` table with the `Stores` table.
  2. Select the `product_id`, `store`, and `store_name` columns from the combined table.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses a single `JOIN` operation to combine the two tables, which is more efficient than iterating through each product individually.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it uses a single `JOIN` operation, which is the most efficient way to combine two tables based on a common column.

```cpp
SELECT 
  p.product_id,
  s.store,
  s.store_name
FROM 
  Products p
JOIN 
  Stores s ON p.store = s.store
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of products. This is because the `JOIN` operation uses a sorting algorithm to combine the two tables.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of products. This is because we need to store the result table.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses a single `JOIN` operation, which is the most efficient way to combine two tables based on a common column.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: `JOIN` operation, table combination.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a `JOIN` operation to combine two tables based on a common column.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a single `JOIN` operation to combine two tables, rather than iterating through each product individually.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve combining two tables based on a common column.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Using a subquery or iterating through each product individually, rather than using a `JOIN` operation.
- Edge cases to watch for: Products that are not in any store, stores that have no products.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a subquery or iterating through each product individually, rather than using a `JOIN` operation.
- Testing considerations: Testing the query with different inputs and edge cases to ensure that it produces the correct results.
