## Market Analysis II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/market-analysis-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A list of `orders` where each order is a list containing `order_id`, `buyer_id`, and `order_date`.
- Input constraints: Each `order_id` is unique, and `order_date` is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
- Expected output format: A list of `buyer_id`s who have placed at least two orders in the database, sorted in ascending order.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling duplicate `buyer_id`s, orders with different dates, and ensuring the output is sorted.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Test case 1: `orders = [[1, 1, '2022-01-01'], [2, 1, '2022-01-02'], [3, 2, '2022-01-03']]`. Expected output: `[1]`.
- Test case 2: `orders = [[1, 1, '2022-01-01'], [2, 2, '2022-01-02'], [3, 3, '2022-01-03']]`. Expected output: `[]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to iterate over each order in the list and keep track of the count of orders for each buyer.
- This approach involves using a dictionary or map to store the count of orders for each buyer.
- For each order, increment the count of the corresponding buyer in the dictionary.
- Finally, iterate over the dictionary and add the buyer to the result list if their count is greater than 1.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>

vector<int> marketAnalysisII(vector<vector<string>>& orders) {
    map<int, int> buyerCount;
    for (auto& order : orders) {
        int buyerId = stoi(order[1]);
        if (buyerCount.find(buyerId) != buyerCount.end()) {
            buyerCount[buyerId]++;
        } else {
            buyerCount[buyerId] = 1;
        }
    }

    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& pair : buyerCount) {
        if (pair.second > 1) {
            result.push_back(pair.first);
        }
    }
    sort(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m \log m)$, where $n$ is the number of orders and $m$ is the number of unique buyers. The first part of the time complexity comes from iterating over the orders, and the second part comes from sorting the result list.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as in the worst case, we might need to store all orders in the dictionary.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are iterating over each order and then sorting the result list. The space complexity occurs because we are storing the count of orders for each buyer in the dictionary.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is to use a `map` or dictionary to store the count of orders for each buyer and then filter out buyers with a count greater than 1.
- This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass over the orders and uses a dictionary to efficiently keep track of the count of orders for each buyer.
- The optimality of this approach comes from the fact that we are only iterating over the orders once and using a dictionary to store the count of orders for each buyer, resulting in a linear time complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>

vector<int> marketAnalysisII(vector<vector<string>>& orders) {
    map<int, int> buyerCount;
    for (auto& order : orders) {
        int buyerId = stoi(order[1]);
        buyerCount[buyerId]++;
    }

    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& pair : buyerCount) {
        if (pair.second > 1) {
            result.push_back(pair.first);
        }
    }
    sort(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Using a dictionary to efficiently keep track of the count of orders for each buyer.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Iterating over the orders and using a dictionary to filter out buyers with a count greater than 1.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a dictionary to reduce the time complexity of the solution.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the count of orders for each buyer to 0.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling duplicate orders and ensuring the output is sorted.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a slow data structure, such as a list, to store the count of orders for each buyer.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it produces the correct output.
