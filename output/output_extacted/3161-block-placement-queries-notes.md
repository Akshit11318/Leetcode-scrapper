## Block Placement Queries
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/block-placement-queries/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a 2D grid representing a floor plan, where each cell represents a 1x1 square meter area. The grid is filled with `0`s and `1`s, where `0` represents an empty space and `1` represents a block. The goal is to answer queries about the number of blocks in a given rectangle.
- Expected output format: For each query, output the number of blocks in the specified rectangle.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The grid size can be up to 1000x1000, and there can be up to 1000 queries. The rectangle specified in each query can be of any size, and it can overlap with other rectangles.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - For a grid like `[[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]`, a query for the rectangle `(0, 0, 2, 2)` should return `5` because there are 5 blocks in the rectangle.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The simplest approach is to iterate over each cell in the specified rectangle and count the number of blocks.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Iterate over each query.
    2. For each query, iterate over each cell in the specified rectangle.
    3. Check if the cell contains a block (`1`).
    4. If it does, increment the count of blocks.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
class BlockPlacementQueries {
public:
    vector<int> executeQueries(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<int> results;
        for (auto& query : queries) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = query[0]; i <= query[2]; i++) {
                for (int j = query[1]; j <= query[3]; j++) {
                    if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            results.push_back(count);
        }
        return results;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(q \cdot m \cdot n)$, where $q$ is the number of queries, $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the rectangle in each query. This is because for each query, we are potentially iterating over all cells in the rectangle.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(q)$, for storing the results of each query.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves iterating over all cells in each query rectangle, leading to the time complexity. The space complexity is due to storing the results of each query.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a prefix sum array to store the cumulative sum of blocks in the grid. This allows us to calculate the number of blocks in any rectangle in constant time.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Create a prefix sum array `prefixSum` of the same size as the grid.
    2. Initialize the first cell of `prefixSum` to the value of the first cell in the grid.
    3. For each cell in the grid (starting from the second cell), calculate the prefix sum by adding the value of the current cell to the prefix sum of the cell above it and to the left, and subtracting the prefix sum of the cell above-left.
    4. For each query, calculate the number of blocks in the rectangle by using the prefix sum array. The formula is `prefixSum[bottom-right] - prefixSum[bottom-left] - prefixSum[top-right] + prefixSum[top-left]`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it reduces the time complexity of answering each query to constant time, and the space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the grid.

```cpp
class BlockPlacementQueries {
public:
    vector<int> executeQueries(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> prefixSum(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        
        // Calculate prefix sum
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                prefixSum[i][j] = prefixSum[i-1][j] + prefixSum[i][j-1] - prefixSum[i-1][j-1] + grid[i-1][j-1];
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> results;
        for (auto& query : queries) {
            int x1 = query[0], y1 = query[1], x2 = query[2], y2 = query[3];
            int count = prefixSum[x2+1][y2+1] - prefixSum[x1][y2+1] - prefixSum[x2+1][y1] + prefixSum[x1][y1];
            results.push_back(count);
        }
        return results;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n + q)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the grid, and $q$ is the number of queries. This is because calculating the prefix sum takes $O(m \cdot n)$ time, and answering each query takes constant time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, for the prefix sum array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it minimizes the time complexity of answering each query to constant time, and the space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the grid.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Prefix sum array, cumulative sum.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a prefix sum array to reduce the time complexity of queries.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the time complexity of queries by pre-processing the data.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve querying a grid or array, such as range sum queries.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating the prefix sum, or incorrectly using the prefix sum to answer queries.
- Edge cases to watch for: Queries that overlap with the edges of the grid, or queries that are empty (i.e., have zero area).
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach to answer queries, which can lead to high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different grid sizes, query sizes, and query positions to ensure correctness and performance.
