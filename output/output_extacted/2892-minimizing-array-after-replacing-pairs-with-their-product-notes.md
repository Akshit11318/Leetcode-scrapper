## Minimizing Array After Replacing Pairs With Their Product

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimizing-array-after-replacing-pairs-with-their-product/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is an array of integers `nums`, and the constraint is that we can replace any pair of elements with their product.
- Expected output format: The goal is to find the minimum possible sum of the array after replacing pairs with their product.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: We should consider all possible pairs and their products, and the edge case where the array has an odd length.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, we can replace the pair `(1, 2)` with their product `2`, and the pair `(3, 4)` with their product `12`, resulting in the array `[2, 12]` with a sum of `14`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The first approach that comes to mind is to try all possible pairs and their products, and calculate the sum of the resulting array.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible pairs of elements in the array.
  2. For each pair, calculate their product and replace the pair with the product in the array.
  3. Calculate the sum of the resulting array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it has a high time complexity due to the generation of all possible pairs.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minimizeArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int minSum = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all possible pairs of elements
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            // Create a copy of the original array
            std::vector<int> arr = nums;
            
            // Replace the pair with their product
            int product = arr[i] * arr[j];
            arr.erase(arr.begin() + j);
            arr.erase(arr.begin() + i);
            arr.push_back(product);
            
            // Calculate the sum of the resulting array
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < arr.size(); k++) {
                sum += arr[k];
            }
            
            // Update the minimum sum
            minSum = std::min(minSum, sum);
        }
    }
    
    return minSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we generate all possible pairs of elements, which takes $O(n^2)$ time, and for each pair, we calculate the sum of the resulting array, which takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we create a copy of the original array for each pair.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity occurs because we generate all possible pairs of elements, which results in a large number of iterations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to sort the array in ascending order and then replace the smallest pair with their product. This is because the product of the smallest pair will always be smaller than the product of any other pair.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the array in ascending order.
  2. While the array has more than one element, replace the smallest pair with their product.
  3. Calculate the sum of the resulting array.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it always replaces the smallest pair with their product, which results in the smallest possible sum.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minimizeArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    while (nums.size() > 1) {
        int product = nums[0] * nums[1];
        nums.erase(nums.begin());
        nums.erase(nums.begin());
        nums.push_back(product);
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        sum += num;
    }
    
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \log n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we sort the array in ascending order, which takes $O(n \log n)$ time, and then we replace the smallest pair with their product, which takes $O(n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. This is because we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the product of the smallest pair.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it always replaces the smallest pair with their product, which results in the smallest possible sum.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, greedy algorithm.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Replacing pairs with their product to minimize the sum.
- Optimization techniques learned: Sorting the array in ascending order to replace the smallest pair with their product.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not sorting the array in ascending order before replacing the smallest pair with their product.
- Edge cases to watch for: The edge case where the array has an odd length.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that generates all possible pairs of elements.
- Testing considerations: Testing the approach with different input arrays to ensure that it produces the correct output.
