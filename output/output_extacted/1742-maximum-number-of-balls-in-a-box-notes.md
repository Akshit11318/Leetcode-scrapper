## Maximum Number of Balls in a Box

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-balls-in-a-box/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `lowLimit` and `highLimit` integers, representing the range of possible box sizes.
- Expected output: The maximum number of balls that can fit into a box within the given size range.
- Key requirements and edge cases:
  - The box size must be within the range `[lowLimit, highLimit]`.
  - The maximum number of balls that can fit is determined by the number of boxes of the same size that can be filled.
- Example test cases:
  - For `lowLimit = 1` and `highLimit = 10`, the maximum number of balls might be achieved by having multiple boxes of the same size within the range.
  - For `lowLimit = 5` and `highLimit = 15`, the solution must consider the optimal box size within this range to maximize the number of balls.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves checking every possible box size within the given range and determining how many balls can fit into boxes of that size.
- This approach requires iterating over each possible box size, calculating the number of balls that can fit, and keeping track of the maximum found so far.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem by checking every possibility, albeit inefficiently.

```cpp
int countBalls(int lowLimit, int highLimit) {
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (int boxSize = lowLimit; boxSize <= highLimit; ++boxSize) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int ball = lowLimit; ball <= highLimit; ++ball) {
            if (ball % boxSize == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        maxCount = max(maxCount, count);
    }
    return maxCount;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n = highLimit - lowLimit + 1$, because for each possible box size, we iterate over all balls to count how many can fit.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum count and the current count for each box size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inefficient due to the nested loop structure, which leads to quadratic time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight is recognizing that the problem can be solved more efficiently by focusing on the properties of the numbers within the given range rather than iterating over each possible box size and ball.
- We can calculate the remainder of each number when divided by the box size and group numbers by these remainders. The box size that results in the most numbers having the same remainder will yield the maximum number of balls.
- However, the problem simplifies further when recognizing that the maximum number of balls in a box is directly related to the frequency of the remainders when dividing the numbers in the range by their box sizes. Since we are looking for the maximum frequency of any remainder (which corresponds to a specific box size), we can simplify our calculation by focusing on the most frequent remainder across all possible box sizes.

```cpp
int countBalls(int lowLimit, int highLimit) {
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (int boxSize = lowLimit; boxSize <= highLimit; ++boxSize) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int ball = lowLimit; ball <= highLimit; ++ball) {
            if (ball % boxSize == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        maxCount = max(maxCount, count);
    }
    return maxCount;
}
```

However, we can observe that this problem actually benefits from a histogram approach where we count the frequency of each remainder when numbers are divided by their box size. But given the nature of the problem, the optimal approach simplifies to iterating through each number in the range and calculating its box size by summing its digits, then counting the frequency of these box sizes.

```cpp
int countBalls(int lowLimit, int highLimit) {
    vector<int> boxCounts(46, 0); // Assuming the maximum sum of digits is 45 (for 99999)
    for (int num = lowLimit; num <= highLimit; ++num) {
        int boxSize = 0;
        int tempNum = num;
        while (tempNum > 0) {
            boxSize += tempNum % 10;
            tempNum /= 10;
        }
        boxCounts[boxSize]++;
    }
    return *max_element(boxCounts.begin(), boxCounts.end());
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n = highLimit - lowLimit + 1$ and $m$ is the average number of digits in the numbers within the range, because for each number, we calculate its box size by summing its digits.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a fixed-size array to store the counts of box sizes, assuming the maximum possible sum of digits is constant.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly calculates the frequency of each box size by summing the digits of each number, avoiding unnecessary iterations and thus achieving a linear time complexity with respect to the input size and the number of digits in the numbers.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated include the use of frequency counting and the optimization of iteration over the input range.
- Problem-solving patterns identified include simplifying the problem by focusing on the properties of the input data (in this case, the sum of digits of each number).
- Optimization techniques learned include reducing the number of iterations and using a fixed-size array for counting frequencies.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors include not validating the input range and not handling edge cases properly.
- Edge cases to watch for include the case where `lowLimit` equals `highLimit` and the case where the input range is very large.
- Performance pitfalls include using inefficient data structures or algorithms that lead to high time or space complexity.
- Testing considerations include testing the function with different input ranges and edge cases to ensure it works correctly.
