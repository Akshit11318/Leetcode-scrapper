## Mark Elements on Array by Performing Queries

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/mark-elements-on-array-by-performing-queries/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given an array of integers `arr` and a list of queries `queries`, where each query is in the form of a list containing two integers, `[start, end]`.
- Expected output format: The task is to mark the elements in the array that are within the range of any query.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - The queries are 0-indexed.
  - The array and queries are non-empty.
  - The `start` and `end` indices in each query are valid for the array.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `queries = [[1, 3], [2, 4]]`, the output should be `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]` because the elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 are within the range of the queries.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The most straightforward approach is to iterate over each query and for each query, iterate over the array to mark the elements that fall within the query range.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an array `marked` of the same length as `arr`, with all elements initially set to 0.
  2. For each query in `queries`, iterate over the range from `start` to `end` (inclusive) and mark the corresponding element in `marked` as 1.
  3. Return the `marked` array.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows from understanding the problem statement and is the most intuitive way to solve the problem without considering efficiency.

```cpp
vector<int> markElements(vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> marked(arr.size(), 0);
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int start = query[0];
        int end = query[1];
        for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
            marked[i] = 1;
        }
    }
    return marked;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of queries, $m$ is the average length of a query range, and $k$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because for each query, we potentially iterate over the entire array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, for the `marked` array.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has high time complexity due to nested loops over the queries and the array.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of marking elements within each query range separately, we can use a single pass through the array and for each element, check if it falls within any query range.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an array `marked` of the same length as `arr`, with all elements initially set to 0.
  2. Iterate over the array. For each element, check if it falls within the range of any query.
  3. If an element falls within a query range, mark it in the `marked` array.
  4. Return the `marked` array.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the array and each query is considered exactly once for each element, reducing the time complexity significantly compared to the brute force approach.

```cpp
vector<int> markElements(vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> marked(arr.size(), 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        for (auto& query : queries) {
            if (i >= query[0] && i <= query[1]) {
                marked[i] = 1;
                break; // No need to check other queries for this element
            }
        }
    }
    return marked;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n)$, where $k$ is the number of elements in the array and $n$ is the number of queries. This is because for each element, we potentially check all queries.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, for the `marked` array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the best possible time complexity because we must at least read the input array and queries once.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, conditional checks, and array manipulation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Reducing nested loops by reordering operations or using different data structures.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the number of iterations and avoiding redundant checks.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving array manipulation and query processing.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect indexing, missing edge cases (e.g., empty array or queries), and inefficient looping.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling queries that overlap, queries that are outside the array bounds, and duplicate queries.
- Performance pitfalls: Using excessively nested loops or not optimizing the iteration order.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing with various input sizes, query ranges, and edge cases to ensure correctness and efficiency.
