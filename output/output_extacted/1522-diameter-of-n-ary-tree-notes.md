## Diameter of N-ary Tree
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-n-ary-tree/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An N-ary tree represented as a list of nodes where each node has a unique value and a list of its children.
- Constraints: The tree is connected and has at least one node but no more than 10^4 nodes. Each node's value is unique and ranges from 0 to 10^4.
- Expected Output: The diameter of the tree, which is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
- Key Requirements and Edge Cases:
  - The tree can have any structure; it's not limited to binary trees.
  - The diameter might not pass through the root.
  - The tree is undirected.
- Example Test Cases:
  - A simple tree with a few nodes to understand the basic structure.
  - A tree with a large diameter that does not pass through the root.
  - An edge case with a tree having only one node.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves calculating the distance between every pair of nodes to find the longest path.
- This approach requires traversing the tree from each node to every other node, which can be done using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) for each node.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem statement by considering all possible paths.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int diameter = 0;
    int diameterOfNaryTree(Node* root) {
        dfs(root);
        return diameter;
    }
    
    int dfs(Node* node) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        vector<int> depths;
        for (auto child : node->children) {
            depths.push_back(dfs(child));
        }
        
        sort(depths.rbegin(), depths.rend());
        
        if (depths.size() >= 2) {
            diameter = max(diameter, depths[0] + depths[1]);
        }
        
        return depths.empty() ? 0 : depths[0] + 1;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N \log N)$ due to sorting at each node, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the tree.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$ for storing the recursion stack in the worst case (a skewed tree).
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation at each node, and the space complexity is due to the recursive call stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of calculating the diameter from every node, we can keep track of the two longest paths from each node as we perform a DFS traversal. This way, we only need to traverse the tree once.
- Detailed breakdown: For each node, calculate the length of the longest path that includes this node by considering the lengths of the paths through its children.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it visits each node once and keeps track of the necessary information to calculate the diameter without redundant calculations.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach has a linear time complexity with respect to the number of nodes and edges, which is the minimum required to visit each node at least once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int diameter = 0;
    int diameterOfNaryTree(Node* root) {
        dfs(root);
        return diameter;
    }
    
    int dfs(Node* node) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        vector<int> depths;
        for (auto child : node->children) {
            depths.push_back(dfs(child));
        }
        
        sort(depths.rbegin(), depths.rend());
        
        if (depths.size() >= 2) {
            diameter = max(diameter, depths[0] + depths[1]);
        }
        
        return depths.empty() ? 0 : depths[0] + 1;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(N \log K)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes and $K$ is the maximum number of children a node can have, due to sorting at each node.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$ for the recursion stack in the worst case.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the optimal solution because it traverses the tree once, keeping track of the necessary information to calculate the diameter without redundant calculations.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts: Depth-First Search (DFS), sorting, and keeping track of the longest paths from each node.
- Problem-solving patterns: Identifying the key insight that allows for a single traversal of the tree.
- Optimization techniques: Avoiding redundant calculations by keeping track of the necessary information during the traversal.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not properly handling edge cases (e.g., an empty tree or a tree with one node).
- Performance pitfalls: Using an inefficient algorithm that results in a higher time complexity than necessary.
- Testing considerations: Ensuring that the solution works correctly for different tree structures and sizes.
