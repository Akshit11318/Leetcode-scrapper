## Query Kth Smallest Trimmed Number
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/query-kth-smallest-trimmed-number/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A list of integers `nums`, and a list of queries where each query is a list of three integers `[lower, upper, k]`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`, `1 <= queries.length <= 1000`, `1 <= lower <= upper <= 10^4`, `1 <= k <= upper - lower + 1`.
- Expected output format: A list of integers, where each integer is the kth smallest trimmed number for the corresponding query.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where `lower` is greater than `upper`, or `k` is greater than the number of trimmed numbers.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `queries = [[1, 3, 1], [2, 4, 2]]`, the output should be `[1, 3]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each query, trim each number in `nums` to the range `[lower, upper]`, and then find the kth smallest trimmed number.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. For each query `[lower, upper, k]`, iterate over each number `num` in `nums`.
  2. Trim `num` to the range `[lower, upper]` by taking the maximum of `lower` and the minimum of `upper` and `num`.
  3. Store the trimmed numbers in a list.
  4. Sort the list of trimmed numbers.
  5. Return the kth smallest trimmed number.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly follows from the problem statement and does not require any additional insights.

```cpp
vector<int> smallestTrimmedNumbers(vector<vector<int>>& queries, vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        vector<int> trimmed;
        for (int num : nums) {
            trimmed.push_back(max(query[0], min(query[1], num)));
        }
        sort(trimmed.begin(), trimmed.end());
        result.push_back(trimmed[query[2] - 1]);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(q \cdot n \cdot \log n)$, where $q$ is the number of queries and $n$ is the number of numbers in `nums`. This is because for each query, we sort the list of trimmed numbers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of numbers in `nums`. This is because we need to store the list of trimmed numbers.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we sort the list of trimmed numbers for each query. The space complexity occurs because we need to store the list of trimmed numbers.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of sorting the list of trimmed numbers for each query, we can sort the list of numbers in `nums` once and then use binary search to find the kth smallest trimmed number for each query.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the list of numbers in `nums`.
  2. For each query `[lower, upper, k]`, use binary search to find the kth smallest trimmed number.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we only need to sort the list of numbers in `nums` once, and then we can use binary search to find the kth smallest trimmed number for each query in $O(\log n)$ time.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because we need to sort the list of numbers in `nums` at least once to find the kth smallest trimmed number for each query.

```cpp
vector<int> smallestTrimmedNumbers(vector<vector<int>>& queries, vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        vector<int> trimmed;
        for (int num : nums) {
            trimmed.push_back(max(query[0], min(query[1], num)));
        }
        sort(trimmed.begin(), trimmed.end());
        result.push_back(trimmed[query[2] - 1]);
    }
    return result;
}
```
However, this solution is still the same as the previous one because we are sorting the trimmed numbers for each query. We can optimize this by sorting the original numbers first, and then for each query, we can use a single pass through the sorted numbers to find the kth smallest trimmed number.

```cpp
vector<int> smallestTrimmedNumbers(vector<vector<int>>& queries, vector<int>& nums) {
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int trimmed = max(query[0], min(query[1], num));
            count++;
            if (count == query[2]) {
                result.push_back(trimmed);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + q \cdot n)$, where $q$ is the number of queries and $n$ is the number of numbers in `nums`. This is because we sort the list of numbers in `nums` once, and then for each query, we make a single pass through the sorted numbers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, where $n$ is the number of numbers in `nums`. This is because we only need a constant amount of space to store the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we only need to sort the list of numbers in `nums` once, and then we can use a single pass through the sorted numbers to find the kth smallest trimmed number for each query.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sorting, binary search.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a single pass through the sorted numbers to find the kth smallest trimmed number.
- Optimization techniques learned: Sorting the list of numbers in `nums` once and then using a single pass through the sorted numbers to find the kth smallest trimmed number for each query.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the kth smallest element in a sorted list, finding the kth largest element in a sorted list.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not sorting the list of numbers in `nums` before finding the kth smallest trimmed number for each query.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where `lower` is greater than `upper`, or `k` is greater than the number of trimmed numbers.
- Performance pitfalls: Sorting the list of trimmed numbers for each query instead of sorting the list of numbers in `nums` once and then using a single pass through the sorted numbers to find the kth smallest trimmed number for each query.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
