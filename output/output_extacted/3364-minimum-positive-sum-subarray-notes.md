## Minimum Positive Sum Subarray
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-positive-sum-subarray/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an array of integers `nums`, find the length of the shortest subarray with a sum greater than zero.
- Input format: An integer array `nums`.
- Constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: The length of the shortest subarray with a sum greater than zero.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling arrays with all non-positive numbers, empty arrays, and arrays with a mix of positive and negative numbers.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, Output: `1` (The shortest subarray with a sum greater than zero is `[1]`).
  - Input: `nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]`, Output: `-1` (There is no subarray with a sum greater than zero).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Check every possible subarray to find the shortest one with a sum greater than zero.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize the minimum length to infinity.
  2. Iterate over all possible subarrays.
  3. For each subarray, calculate its sum.
  4. If the sum is greater than zero, update the minimum length.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward and ensures that all possibilities are considered.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPositiveSumSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int minLen = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                    sum += nums[k];
                }
                if (sum > 0) {
                    minLen = min(minLen, j - i + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minLen == INT_MAX ? -1 : minLen;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we have three nested loops: two to generate all possible subarrays and one to sum the elements of each subarray.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum length and the sum of the current subarray.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is cubic due to the nested loops, and the space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the prefix sum array.
  2. Initialize the minimum length to infinity.
  3. Iterate over all possible subarrays using two pointers.
  4. For each subarray, calculate its sum using the prefix sum array.
  5. If the sum is greater than zero, update the minimum length.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has a linear time complexity for calculating the prefix sum array and then uses two nested loops to consider all subarrays, resulting in a quadratic time complexity overall, which is optimal for this problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPositiveSumSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + nums[i];
        }
        
        int minLen = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                int sum = prefixSum[j + 1] - prefixSum[i];
                if (sum > 0) {
                    minLen = min(minLen, j - i + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minLen == INT_MAX ? -1 : minLen;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we first calculate the prefix sum array in linear time and then use two nested loops to consider all subarrays.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the prefix sum array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it efficiently considers all possible subarrays and their sums, leveraging the prefix sum array to reduce the time complexity of sum calculations.
