## Maximum Split of Positive Even Integers
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-split-of-positive-even-integers/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `finalSum` that is guaranteed to be a positive even integer.
- Constraints: `2 <= finalSum <= 10^10`
- Expected output: The maximum number of positive even integers that can be obtained by splitting `finalSum`.
- Key requirements: Each integer in the split must be even, and the sum of these integers must equal `finalSum`.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `finalSum = 12`
    Output: `6`
    Explanation: `12 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2`
  - Input: `finalSum = 28`
    Output: `14`
    Explanation: `28 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2`

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try to split `finalSum` into as many even integers as possible.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Start with the smallest even integer, which is 2.
  2. Keep subtracting 2 from `finalSum` until it's no longer possible.
  3. The number of times we can subtract 2 is the maximum number of positive even integers we can get.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward and simple way to approach the problem.

```cpp
int maxEvenSplit(int finalSum) {
    int count = 0;
    while (finalSum >= 2) {
        finalSum -= 2;
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\frac{finalSum}{2})$ because we're subtracting 2 from `finalSum` in each iteration.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we're only using a constant amount of space to store the count.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is directly proportional to the value of `finalSum` because we're performing a constant amount of work in each iteration. The space complexity is constant because we're not using any data structures that grow with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Instead of subtracting 2 from `finalSum` in each iteration, we can simply divide `finalSum` by 2 to get the maximum number of positive even integers.
- Detailed breakdown: Since each integer in the split must be even, the smallest possible integer is 2. Therefore, the maximum number of integers we can get is $\frac{finalSum}{2}$.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it gives us the maximum number of positive even integers that can be obtained by splitting `finalSum`.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it gives us the maximum possible number of integers.

```cpp
int maxEvenSplit(int finalSum) {
    return finalSum / 2;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we're performing a constant amount of work.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we're only using a constant amount of space to store the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it gives us the maximum number of positive even integers that can be obtained by splitting `finalSum`. The time and space complexities are both constant, which means this approach is efficient and scalable.
