## Linked List Components
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-components/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves a linked list and a list of indices. The linked list is represented by a `ListNode` struct, where each node has an integer value and a pointer to the next node. The list of indices is a vector of integers. The goal is to find the number of linked list components that can be formed using the given indices.
- Expected output format: The output is an integer representing the number of linked list components.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The linked list can be empty, and the list of indices can be empty or contain duplicate values. The indices in the list are 0-based.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `head = [0,1,2,3]`, `G = [0,1,3]`. Output: `2`. Explanation: The linked list can be divided into two components: `[0,1]` and `[3]`.
  - Example 2: Input: `head = [0,1,2,3,4]`, `G = [4,0,1,3]`. Output: `2`. Explanation: The linked list can be divided into two components: `[0,1]` and `[3,4]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating through the linked list and checking if the current node's value is in the list of indices. If it is, we can start a new component. We can use a set to store the indices for efficient lookup.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Create a set from the list of indices for efficient lookup.
  2. Initialize a variable to store the number of components.
  3. Initialize a variable to store the current component's start node.
  4. Iterate through the linked list. If the current node's value is in the set of indices, it means we can start a new component.
  5. If we can start a new component, increment the component count and update the current component's start node.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand. It involves iterating through the linked list and checking if the current node's value is in the list of indices.

```cpp
// Brute force approach
class Solution {
public:
    int numComponents(ListNode* head, vector<int>& G) {
        unordered_set<int> g(G.begin(), G.end());
        int count = 0;
        while (head) {
            if (g.count(head->val)) {
                count++;
                while (head && g.count(head->val)) {
                    head = head->next;
                }
            } else {
                while (head && !g.count(head->val)) {
                    head = head->next;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the linked list and $m$ is the number of indices in the list. This is because we iterate through the linked list and the list of indices once to create the set.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where $m$ is the number of indices in the list. This is because we store the indices in a set.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we iterate through the linked list and the list of indices once. The space complexity occurs because we store the indices in a set.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is similar to the brute force approach. However, we can optimize the solution by only iterating through the linked list once and using a set to store the indices for efficient lookup.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Create a set from the list of indices for efficient lookup.
  2. Initialize a variable to store the number of components.
  3. Initialize a variable to store whether the current node is part of a component.
  4. Iterate through the linked list. If the current node's value is in the set of indices and the previous node is not part of a component, increment the component count.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it only iterates through the linked list once and uses a set for efficient lookup.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must iterate through the linked list at least once to count the number of components.

```cpp
// Optimal approach
class Solution {
public:
    int numComponents(ListNode* head, vector<int>& G) {
        unordered_set<int> g(G.begin(), G.end());
        int count = 0;
        bool inComponent = false;
        while (head) {
            if (g.count(head->val)) {
                if (!inComponent) {
                    count++;
                    inComponent = true;
                }
            } else {
                inComponent = false;
            }
            head = head->next;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem demonstrates the use of sets for efficient lookup and the importance of iterating through the linked list only once for optimal time complexity.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem involves identifying a pattern in the linked list and using a set to store the indices for efficient lookup.
- Optimization techniques learned: The problem demonstrates the use of a set for efficient lookup and the importance of minimizing the number of iterations through the linked list.
- Similar problems to practice: Similar problems include finding the intersection of two linked lists, finding the middle of a linked list, and reversing a linked list.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: A common implementation error is iterating through the linked list multiple times, which can result in a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.
- Edge cases to watch for: Edge cases to watch for include an empty linked list, an empty list of indices, and a list of indices with duplicate values.
- Performance pitfalls: A performance pitfall is using a data structure with a high time complexity for lookup, such as a vector or a list, instead of a set.
- Testing considerations: Testing considerations include testing the function with an empty linked list, an empty list of indices, and a list of indices with duplicate values.
