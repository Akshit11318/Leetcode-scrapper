## Adjacent Increasing Subarrays Detection I

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/adjacent-increasing-subarrays-detection-i/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A list of integers representing the `nums` array.
- Output: Return `true` if all elements in `nums` are in strictly increasing order, and `false` otherwise.
- Key Requirements:
  - The array must be non-empty.
  - The array can contain negative numbers and zero.
- Edge Cases:
  - Empty array: Should return `false`.
  - Single-element array: Should return `true`.
  - Array with duplicate elements: Should return `false`.
- Example Test Cases:
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, Output: `true`
  - Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, Output: `false`
  - Input: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, Output: `false`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to compare each element with its next neighbor.
- This approach involves iterating through the array and checking if each element is less than the next one.
- This comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
bool increasingTripletSubsequence(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are iterating through the array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space to store the variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are performing a single pass through the array, and the space complexity is constant because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal insight is to realize that the brute force approach is already optimal for this problem.
- The key insight is that we must check every pair of adjacent elements at least once to ensure the array is strictly increasing.
- This approach is optimal because it achieves the minimum possible time complexity for the problem.

```cpp
bool increasingTripletSubsequence(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are using a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is optimal because we must examine every element at least once to determine if the array is strictly increasing, and this approach does so in a single pass.
