## Bitwise User Permissions Analysis

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-user-permissions-analysis/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input will be a list of integers representing user permissions.
- Expected output format: The output should be a list of integers representing the maximum permissions for each user.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The maximum permission for each user is the maximum of the bitwise OR of all permissions for that user.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3], the output should be [3] because the maximum permission for the user is the bitwise OR of all permissions, which is 1 | 2 | 3 = 3.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The initial thought process is to iterate over all permissions and calculate the bitwise OR of all permissions for each user.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Initialize an empty list to store the maximum permissions for each user.
  2. Iterate over all permissions.
  3. For each permission, calculate the bitwise OR of all permissions for the current user.
  4. Add the result to the list of maximum permissions.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach comes to mind first because it is the most straightforward way to solve the problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxPermissions(vector<int>& permissions) {
        vector<int> maxPermissions;
        for (int i = 0; i < permissions.size(); i++) {
            int maxPermission = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < permissions.size(); j++) {
                if (j % (i + 1) == 0) {
                    maxPermission |= permissions[j];
                }
            }
            maxPermissions.push_back(maxPermission);
        }
        return maxPermissions;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ where n is the number of permissions, because we are using two nested loops to iterate over all permissions.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where n is the number of permissions, because we are storing the maximum permissions for each user in a list.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are using a brute force approach that involves iterating over all permissions for each user.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is to use a single loop to iterate over all permissions and calculate the bitwise OR of all permissions for each user.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize an empty list to store the maximum permissions for each user.
  2. Iterate over all permissions.
  3. For each permission, calculate the bitwise OR of all permissions for the current user.
  4. Add the result to the list of maximum permissions.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single loop to iterate over all permissions, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we must iterate over all permissions at least once to calculate the maximum permissions for each user.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxPermissions(vector<int>& permissions) {
        vector<int> maxPermissions;
        for (int i = 0; i < permissions.size(); i++) {
            int maxPermission = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < permissions.size(); j += (i + 1)) {
                maxPermission |= permissions[j];
            }
            maxPermissions.push_back(maxPermission);
        }
        return maxPermissions;
    }
};
```
