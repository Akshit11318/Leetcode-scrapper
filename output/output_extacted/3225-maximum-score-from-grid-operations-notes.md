## Maximum Score from Grid Operations
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-grid-operations/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given a grid with dimensions `m x n` and an integer `k`, the task is to find the maximum score that can be achieved by performing grid operations.
- Expected output format: The maximum score as an integer.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The grid is initially empty, and each operation consists of adding a row or column to the grid, with the score being the product of the number of rows and columns.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, if the grid has dimensions `3 x 3` and `k = 2`, the maximum score would be achieved by adding two rows and two columns.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One possible approach is to try all possible combinations of adding rows and columns to the grid.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize the score to 0.
  2. For each possible number of rows from 0 to `m`, and for each possible number of columns from 0 to `n`, calculate the score as the product of the number of rows and columns.
  3. Update the maximum score if the current score is higher.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it has an exponential time complexity due to the nested loops.

```cpp
int maxScore(int m, int n, int k) {
    int max_score = 0;
    for (int rows = 0; rows <= m; rows++) {
        for (int cols = 0; cols <= n; cols++) {
            if (rows * cols <= k) {
                max_score = max(max_score, rows * cols);
            }
        }
    }
    return max_score;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the grid.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of space is used.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the nested loops over all possible combinations of rows and columns, while the space complexity is constant because only a single variable is used to store the maximum score.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The score is maximized when the number of rows and columns are as close to each other as possible.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the maximum score to 0.
  2. Calculate the maximum possible score by taking the square root of `k` and rounding down to the nearest integer.
  3. Update the maximum score if the calculated score is higher.
- Proof of optimality: The score is maximized when the number of rows and columns are as close to each other as possible, which is achieved by taking the square root of `k`.

```cpp
int maxScore(int m, int n, int k) {
    int max_score = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= k; i++) {
        if (i <= m && i <= n) {
            max_score = max(max_score, i * i);
        }
    }
    return max_score;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\sqrt{k})$, where $k$ is the given integer.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of space is used.
> - **Optimality proof:** The time complexity is optimal because we only need to iterate up to the square root of `k` to find the maximum score, and the space complexity is constant because only a single variable is used to store the maximum score.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The importance of finding the optimal solution by identifying the key insight that leads to it.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The use of mathematical reasoning to find the optimal solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: The use of iteration up to the square root of a number to reduce the time complexity.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems that involve finding the maximum or minimum value of a function.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for edge cases, such as when `k` is 0.
- Edge cases to watch for: When `m` or `n` is 0, the maximum score is 0.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that has an exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it works correctly.
