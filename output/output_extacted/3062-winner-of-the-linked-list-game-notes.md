## Winner of the Linked List Game

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/winner-of-the-linked-list-game/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A linked list where each node has a value `val` and a pointer `next` to the next node, and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: The linked list is circular, and there are no duplicate values.
- Expected output format: The node with the highest value in the list, or `null` if the list is empty.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The list is circular, meaning that the last node's `next` pointer points to the first node.
  - The list can be empty.
  - `k` can be any positive integer.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 2`, Output: `4`
  - Example 2: Input: `head = [2,3,1]`, `k = 3`, Output: `3`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: We need to traverse the linked list and keep track of the node with the highest value.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the maximum value and the corresponding node.
  2. Traverse the linked list, updating the maximum value and node as needed.
  3. When we reach the end of the list, return the node with the maximum value.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward solution that directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

ListNode* winnerOfGame(ListNode* head, int k) {
    if (head == NULL) return NULL;
    
    int maxVal = head->val;
    ListNode* maxNode = head;
    
    ListNode* curr = head;
    do {
        if (curr->val > maxVal) {
            maxVal = curr->val;
            maxNode = curr;
        }
        curr = curr->next;
    } while (curr != head);
    
    return maxNode;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the linked list, because we traverse the list once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum value and node.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we need to visit each node in the list once, and the space complexity is constant because we only need to store a few variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach, because we need to traverse the linked list at least once to find the node with the maximum value.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a variable to store the maximum value and the corresponding node.
  2. Traverse the linked list, updating the maximum value and node as needed.
  3. When we reach the end of the list, return the node with the maximum value.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because we need to visit each node in the list at least once to find the node with the maximum value.
- Why further optimization is impossible: We cannot avoid traversing the linked list, so the time complexity is at least $O(n)$.

```cpp
ListNode* winnerOfGame(ListNode* head, int k) {
    if (head == NULL) return NULL;
    
    int maxVal = head->val;
    ListNode* maxNode = head;
    
    ListNode* curr = head;
    do {
        if (curr->val > maxVal) {
            maxVal = curr->val;
            maxNode = curr;
        }
        curr = curr->next;
    } while (curr != head);
    
    return maxNode;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Linked lists, traversal, maximum value finding.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Brute force approach, optimal solution.
- Optimization techniques learned: None, because the optimal solution is the same as the brute force approach.
- Similar problems to practice: Finding the minimum value in a linked list, finding the node with a specific value in a linked list.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not checking for an empty list, not updating the maximum value correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: An empty list, a list with a single node.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a constant amount of space, not traversing the list only once.
- Testing considerations: Test with an empty list, a list with a single node, a list with multiple nodes.
