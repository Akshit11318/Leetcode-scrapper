## Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-number-of-fibonacci-numbers-whose-sum-is-k/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an integer `k` as input and asks for the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers that sum up to `k`.
- Expected output format: The output should be the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: `1 <= k <= 10^9`.
- Example test cases with explanations: For `k = 2`, the output should be `1` because `2` is a Fibonacci number itself. For `k = 3`, the output should be `2` because `2 + 1 = 3`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Start by generating Fibonacci numbers until we reach or exceed `k`. Then, for each generated Fibonacci number, try to find a combination that sums up to `k`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed `k`.
  2. Use a recursive or iterative approach to try all combinations of the generated Fibonacci numbers to sum up to `k`.
  3. Keep track of the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers used in any combination that sums up to `k`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that considers all possible combinations, ensuring we find the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int findMinFibonacciNumbers(int k) {
    vector<int> fibs;
    int a = 1, b = 1;
    while (b <= k) {
        fibs.push_back(b);
        int temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = temp + b;
    }
    int minCount = INT_MAX;
    vector<int> dp(k + 1, INT_MAX);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        for (int fib : fibs) {
            if (i - fib >= 0 && dp[i - fib] != INT_MAX) {
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - fib] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[k];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot n)$ where $n$ is the number of Fibonacci numbers generated, because for each Fibonacci number, we potentially iterate through all numbers up to `k`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k + n)$ for storing the Fibonacci numbers and the dynamic programming table.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating Fibonacci numbers and then trying all combinations, leading to these complexities.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of trying all combinations, we can use dynamic programming to store the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers needed to sum up to each number from `1` to `k`. This way, we avoid redundant calculations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed `k`.
  2. Initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `k + 1`, where `dp[i]` will store the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers needed to sum up to `i`.
  3. Fill the `dp` table iteratively, considering each Fibonacci number and updating `dp[i]` if using the current Fibonacci number results in a smaller count.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers all possible combinations of Fibonacci numbers in an efficient manner, avoiding redundant calculations through dynamic programming.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int findMinFibonacciNumbers(int k) {
    vector<int> fibs;
    int a = 1, b = 1;
    while (b <= k) {
        fibs.push_back(b);
        int temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = temp + b;
    }
    vector<int> dp(k + 1, INT_MAX);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        for (int fib : fibs) {
            if (i - fib >= 0 && dp[i - fib] != INT_MAX) {
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - fib] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[k];
}
```
