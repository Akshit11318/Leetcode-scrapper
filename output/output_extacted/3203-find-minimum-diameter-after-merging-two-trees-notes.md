## Find Minimum Diameter After Merging Two Trees

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-diameter-after-merging-two-trees/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Two binary trees `t1` and `t2`.
- Constraints: The number of nodes in each tree is less than or equal to $10^4$, and the values of the nodes are unique.
- Expected output format: The minimum diameter of the merged tree.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The diameter of a tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. The merging of two trees involves choosing a node from each tree and merging them into a single node.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Test case 1: Two trees with a single node each. The minimum diameter is 0, as there are no edges.
  - Test case 2: Two trees with multiple nodes. The minimum diameter is the minimum diameter of the two trees after merging.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the minimum diameter after merging two trees, we need to consider all possible pairs of nodes, one from each tree, and calculate the diameter after merging them.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible pairs of nodes, one from each tree.
  2. For each pair, merge the two trees by connecting the two nodes.
  3. Calculate the diameter of the merged tree using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
  4. Keep track of the minimum diameter found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward approach that considers all possible scenarios.

```cpp
// Well-commented code with:
// - Clear variable names
// - Input validation
// - Edge case handling
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinDiameter(TreeNode* t1, TreeNode* t2) {
        int minDiameter = INT_MAX;
        vector<TreeNode*> nodes1 = getAllNodes(t1);
        vector<TreeNode*> nodes2 = getAllNodes(t2);
        for (auto node1 : nodes1) {
            for (auto node2 : nodes2) {
                TreeNode* mergedTree = mergeTrees(node1, node2);
                int diameter = getDiameter(mergedTree);
                minDiameter = min(minDiameter, diameter);
            }
        }
        return minDiameter;
    }
    
    vector<TreeNode*> getAllNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<TreeNode*> nodes;
        if (root == nullptr) return nodes;
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        while (!q.empty()) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            nodes.push_back(node);
            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
        return nodes;
    }
    
    TreeNode* mergeTrees(TreeNode* node1, TreeNode* node2) {
        // Merge the two trees by connecting the two nodes
        node1->left = node2;
        return node1;
    }
    
    int getDiameter(TreeNode* root) {
        // Calculate the diameter of the tree using DFS or BFS
        int maxDepth = 0;
        queue<pair<TreeNode*, int>> q;
        q.push({root, 0});
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [node, depth] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            maxDepth = max(maxDepth, depth);
            if (node->left) q.push({node->left, depth + 1});
            if (node->right) q.push({node->right, depth + 1});
        }
        return maxDepth * 2;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 \cdot m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of nodes in the two trees, respectively. This is because we generate all possible pairs of nodes and calculate the diameter for each pair.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of nodes in the two trees, respectively. This is because we store the nodes of the two trees in vectors.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we generate all possible pairs of nodes and calculate the diameter for each pair. The space complexity occurs because we store the nodes of the two trees in vectors.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all possible pairs of nodes, we can find the longest path in each tree and then merge the two trees by connecting the two nodes that are farthest apart.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Find the longest path in each tree using DFS or BFS.
  2. Merge the two trees by connecting the two nodes that are farthest apart.
  3. Calculate the diameter of the merged tree using DFS or BFS.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it considers the longest paths in each tree and merges them to form the longest path in the merged tree.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is optimal because it considers the longest paths in each tree and merges them to form the longest path in the merged tree. Further optimization is impossible because we cannot find a longer path in the merged tree.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinDiameter(TreeNode* t1, TreeNode* t2) {
        int maxDepth1 = getMaxDepth(t1);
        int maxDepth2 = getMaxDepth(t2);
        return maxDepth1 + maxDepth2;
    }
    
    int getMaxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return 0;
        int leftDepth = getMaxDepth(root->left);
        int rightDepth = getMaxDepth(root->right);
        return max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of nodes in the two trees, respectively. This is because we find the longest path in each tree using DFS or BFS.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of nodes in the two trees, respectively. This is because we store the nodes of the two trees in the recursive call stack.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it considers the longest paths in each tree and merges them to form the longest path in the merged tree.
