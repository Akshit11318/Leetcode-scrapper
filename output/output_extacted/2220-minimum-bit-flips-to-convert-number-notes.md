## Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-bit-flips-to-convert-number/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: Two integers, `a` and `b`.
- Constraints: `0 <= a <= 10^9`, `0 <= b <= 10^9`.
- Expected Output: The minimum number of bit flips required to convert `a` to `b`.
- Key Requirements: Count the number of bits that are different between `a` and `b`.
- Example Test Cases:
  - `a = 7`, `b = 10`, Output: `3` (7 in binary is `111`, 10 in binary is `1010`, so we need to flip 3 bits to get from `111` to `1010`).
  - `a = 15`, `b = 16`, Output: `5` (15 in binary is `1111`, 16 in binary is `10000`, so we need to flip 5 bits to get from `1111` to `10000`).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves directly comparing the binary representations of `a` and `b` bit by bit.
- We can achieve this by using a loop to iterate through each bit position in `a` and `b`, starting from the least significant bit.
- For each bit position, we check if the bits are the same in both `a` and `b`. If they are not the same, we increment a counter to keep track of the number of bit flips needed.

```cpp
int minBitFlips(int a, int b) {
    int count = 0;
    while (a || b) {
        // Check if the least significant bits are different
        if ((a & 1) != (b & 1)) {
            count++;
        }
        // Right shift both a and b to move to the next bit position
        a >>= 1;
        b >>= 1;
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log(\max(a, b)))$ because in the worst case, we are iterating through each bit of the larger number.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is dependent on the number of bits in the larger number because we iterate through each bit once. The space complexity is constant because we do not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is recognizing that we can use bitwise operations to directly compare the bits of `a` and `b` without needing to explicitly iterate through each bit position.
- We can use the bitwise XOR operation (`^`) to find the bits that are different between `a` and `b`. The XOR operation returns `1` for each bit position where the bits are different.
- Then, we count the number of `1`s in the result of the XOR operation, which gives us the minimum number of bit flips needed.

```cpp
int minBitFlips(int a, int b) {
    int xorResult = a ^ b;
    int count = 0;
    while (xorResult) {
        // Count the number of 1s in xorResult
        count += xorResult & 1;
        xorResult >>= 1;
    }
    return count;
}
```

Alternatively, we can use a more concise version that achieves the same result:

```cpp
int minBitFlips(int a, int b) {
    int xorResult = a ^ b;
    int count = 0;
    while (xorResult) {
        count++;
        xorResult &= (xorResult - 1); // Clear the least significant 1 bit
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\log(\max(a, b)))$ because in the worst case, we are counting the number of bits set in the XOR result.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This is the best possible time complexity because we must at least examine each bit of the input once to determine the minimum number of bit flips.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Bit manipulation, bitwise operations (XOR, right shift).
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using bitwise operations to compare binary representations.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the need for explicit iteration through bit positions.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving bitwise operations and bit manipulation.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the use of bitwise operations for comparing binary representations.
- Failing to recognize the optimality of the bitwise XOR approach.
- Not handling edge cases correctly (e.g., when `a` or `b` is 0).
- Not validating the inputs correctly.
