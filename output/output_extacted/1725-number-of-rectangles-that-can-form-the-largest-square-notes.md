## Number of Rectangles That Can Form the Largest Square
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-rectangles-that-can-form-the-largest-square/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of integers `rectangles` where each integer is the length of a side of a rectangle.
- Constraints: $1 \leq rectangles.length \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq rectangles[i] \leq 10^5$.
- Expected output format: The number of rectangles that can form the largest square.
- Key requirements: For each rectangle, find the largest square it can form and count how many rectangles can form the largest square among all rectangles.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `rectangles = [4,3,4,3,5]`
  - Output: `3`
  - Explanation: The largest square that can be formed from the given rectangles has a side length of 3. Three rectangles can form this square.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: For each rectangle, calculate the largest square it can form by taking the minimum of its length and width. Then, find the maximum square size among all rectangles and count how many rectangles can form this size of square.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum square size and the count of rectangles that can form this size of square.
  2. Iterate through each rectangle in the `rectangles` array.
  3. For each rectangle, calculate the largest square it can form.
  4. Update the maximum square size if the current rectangle's square size is larger.
  5. Count the rectangles that can form the maximum square size.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly addresses the problem by considering each rectangle individually and comparing their potential square sizes.

```cpp
int countGoodRectangles(vector<int>& rectangles) {
    int maxSide = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int rectangle : rectangles) {
        int side = min(rectangle / 100, rectangle % 100); // Assuming rectangle is in the format of length * 100 + width
        if (side > maxSide) {
            maxSide = side;
            count = 1;
        } else if (side == maxSide) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rectangles. This is because we iterate through the `rectangles` array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear due to the single pass through the input array, and the space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The problem can be optimized by directly finding the maximum square size that can be formed by any rectangle and then counting how many rectangles can achieve this size.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize `maxSide` to keep track of the maximum square side length.
  2. Iterate through each rectangle to find the maximum square side length.
  3. Then, iterate through the rectangles again to count how many can form a square of this maximum side length.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires two passes through the data: one to find the maximum square size and another to count the rectangles that can achieve this size. This is the minimum number of passes needed to solve the problem accurately.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Any solution must at least read the input once, making the time complexity at least $O(n)$. This solution achieves that, making it optimal in terms of time complexity.

```cpp
int countGoodRectangles(vector<int>& rectangles) {
    int maxSide = 0;
    for (int rectangle : rectangles) {
        int side = min(rectangle / 100, rectangle % 100); // Assuming rectangle is in the format of length * 100 + width
        maxSide = max(maxSide, side);
    }
    
    int count = 0;
    for (int rectangle : rectangles) {
        int side = min(rectangle / 100, rectangle % 100); // Assuming rectangle is in the format of length * 100 + width
        if (side == maxSide) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

However, a more efficient version can be written by combining the two passes into one:

```cpp
int countGoodRectangles(vector<int>& rectangles) {
    int maxSide = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int rectangle : rectangles) {
        int side = min(rectangle / 100, rectangle % 100); // Assuming rectangle is in the format of length * 100 + width
        if (side > maxSide) {
            maxSide = side;
            count = 1;
        } else if (side == maxSide) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:

> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we use a constant amount of space to store our variables.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it achieves the minimum time complexity required to solve the problem by only making one pass through the input data.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, comparison, and counting.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Finding the maximum value and then counting occurrences of that value.
- Optimization techniques learned: Reducing the number of passes through the data.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving finding maximum or minimum values and then performing operations based on those values.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrectly calculating the square side length or miscounting the rectangles.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty input array or arrays with very large numbers.
- Performance pitfalls: Making unnecessary passes through the data or using inefficient data structures.
- Testing considerations: Ensure to test with various input sizes and edge cases to verify the solution's correctness and performance.
