## Minimum Time Visiting All Points

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-visiting-all-points/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An array of points where each point is an array of two integers representing the x and y coordinates.
- Constraints: 1 <= points.length <= 100, -100 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 100.
- Expected output format: The minimum time required to visit all points.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The time required to travel from point `i` to point `j` is the maximum of the absolute differences in their x and y coordinates.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - points = [[1,1],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]: The minimum time required to visit all points is 4 (1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7).
  - points = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2]]: The minimum time required to visit all points is 2 (0 -> 1 -> 2).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the time required to travel between each pair of points and sum them up.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize the total time to 0.
  2. Iterate over the points array from the first point to the second last point.
  3. For each point, calculate the time required to travel to the next point.
  4. Add the time required to the total time.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is the most straightforward way to solve the problem.

```cpp
int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    int totalTime = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < points.size() - 1; i++) {
        int xDiff = abs(points[i][0] - points[i + 1][0]);
        int yDiff = abs(points[i][1] - points[i + 1][1]);
        totalTime += max(xDiff, yDiff);
    }
    return totalTime;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of points, because we are iterating over the points array once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the total time and the differences in x and y coordinates.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we are iterating over the points array once, and the space complexity is constant because we are using a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The time required to travel from point `i` to point `j` is the maximum of the absolute differences in their x and y coordinates.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize the total time to 0.
  2. Iterate over the points array from the first point to the second last point.
  3. For each point, calculate the time required to travel to the next point.
  4. Add the time required to the total time.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it calculates the minimum time required to visit all points by iterating over the points array once.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it uses a single pass over the points array.

```cpp
int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    int totalTime = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < points.size() - 1; i++) {
        int xDiff = abs(points[i][0] - points[i + 1][0]);
        int yDiff = abs(points[i][1] - points[i + 1][1]);
        totalTime += max(xDiff, yDiff);
    }
    return totalTime;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, absolute difference, maximum of two values.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Calculating the time required to travel between each pair of points and summing them up.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a single pass over the points array to calculate the minimum time required to visit all points.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve calculating the minimum time required to visit all points, such as the "Minimum Time to Collect All Fruits" problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the total time to 0, not iterating over the points array correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Empty points array, points array with only one point.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a nested loop to calculate the time required to travel between each pair of points, which would result in a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different inputs, such as an empty points array, a points array with only one point, and a points array with multiple points.
