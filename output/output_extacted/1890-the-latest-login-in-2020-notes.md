## The Latest Login in 2020

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/the-latest-login-in-2020/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a table `Logins` with columns `user_id` and `time`, where `time` represents the login time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. The task is to find the latest login time for each user in the year 2020.
- Expected output format: The output should be a table with columns `user_id` and `latest_login`, where `latest_login` is the latest login time for each user in the year 2020.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The solution should handle cases where a user has multiple login times in 2020, and cases where a user has no login times in 2020.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - If a user has multiple login times in 2020, the solution should return the latest one.
  - If a user has no login times in 2020, the solution should not include that user in the output.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating over each row in the `Logins` table and checking if the `time` is in the year 2020. If it is, we update the latest login time for that user.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the latest login time for each user.
  2. Iterate over each row in the `Logins` table.
  3. For each row, check if the `time` is in the year 2020.
  4. If it is, update the latest login time for that user in the dictionary.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be efficient for large datasets.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

struct Login {
    int user_id;
    std::string time;
};

std::vector<std::pair<int, std::string>> latestLogin2020(std::vector<Login>& logins) {
    std::map<int, std::string> latestLogins;
    for (const auto& login : logins) {
        if (login.time.substr(0, 4) == "2020") {
            if (latestLogins.find(login.user_id) == latestLogins.end() || login.time > latestLogins[login.user_id]) {
                latestLogins[login.user_id] = login.time;
            }
        }
    }
    std::vector<std::pair<int, std::string>> result;
    for (const auto& pair : latestLogins) {
        result.push_back(pair);
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Logins` table. This is because we iterate over each row once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of unique users. This is because we store the latest login time for each user in a dictionary.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we iterate over each row in the `Logins` table. The space complexity occurs because we store the latest login time for each user in a dictionary.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a SQL query to directly filter the login times in the year 2020 and get the latest login time for each user.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Use a SQL query to filter the login times in the year 2020.
  2. Use the `MAX` function to get the latest login time for each user.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it directly filters the login times in the year 2020 and gets the latest login time for each user, without iterating over each row in the `Logins` table.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach is already optimal because it uses a SQL query to directly filter the login times and get the latest login time for each user.

```sql
SELECT user_id, MAX(time) AS latest_login
FROM Logins
WHERE time LIKE '2020%'
GROUP BY user_id
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the `Logins` table. This is because the SQL query iterates over each row in the `Logins` table.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of unique users. This is because the SQL query stores the latest login time for each user in a temporary result set.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it directly filters the login times in the year 2020 and gets the latest login time for each user, without iterating over each row in the `Logins` table.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Filtering data based on a condition, using aggregate functions to get the maximum value.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a SQL query to directly filter data and get the desired result.
- Optimization techniques learned: Using a SQL query to directly filter data and get the desired result, rather than iterating over each row in the data.
- Similar problems to practice: Filtering data based on a condition, using aggregate functions to get the maximum or minimum value.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not filtering the data correctly, not using the correct aggregate function.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where a user has multiple login times in 2020, handling cases where a user has no login times in 2020.
- Performance pitfalls: Iterating over each row in the data, rather than using a SQL query to directly filter the data.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input data, testing the solution with edge cases.
