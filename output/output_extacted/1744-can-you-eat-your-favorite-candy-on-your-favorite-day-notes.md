## Can You Eat Your Favorite Candy On Your Favorite Day

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/can-you-eat-your-favorite-candy-on-your-favorite-day/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: `candiesCount`, an array of integers representing the number of candies each day, `queries`, a 2D array of integers where `queries[i] = [favoriteDay, favoriteCandyType]`.
- Expected output: A boolean array where each element is `true` if you can eat your favorite candy on your favorite day, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements: Determine if there are enough candies of your favorite type on your favorite day.
- Edge cases: Handle cases where there are not enough candies or the favorite candy type is not available.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Calculate the total number of candies up to each day and check if it's enough to eat the favorite candy on the favorite day.
- Step-by-step breakdown:
  1. Initialize a prefix sum array `prefixSum` to store the total number of candies up to each day.
  2. For each query, calculate the total number of candies up to the favorite day using the prefix sum array.
  3. Check if the total number of candies is greater than or equal to the favorite candy type.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward way to solve the problem by considering each query individually.

```cpp
vector<bool> canEat(vector<int>& candiesCount, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<bool> result;
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int day = query[0];
        int candyType = query[1];
        int totalCandies = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= day; i++) {
            totalCandies += candiesCount[i];
        }
        if (totalCandies >= candyType + 1) {
            result.push_back(true);
        } else {
            result.push_back(false);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of days and $m$ is the number of queries. This is because we're calculating the total number of candies up to each day for each query.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, excluding the space required for the output array. This is because we're only using a constant amount of space to store the total number of candies and the result.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high because we're using a nested loop to calculate the total number of candies for each query. The space complexity is low because we're not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: Calculate the prefix sum array only once and store it in a separate array. This way, we can avoid recalculating the total number of candies for each query.
- Detailed breakdown:
  1. Calculate the prefix sum array `prefixSum` using a single pass through the `candiesCount` array.
  2. For each query, use the prefix sum array to calculate the total number of candies up to the favorite day in constant time.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because we're only calculating the prefix sum array once, and then using it to answer each query in constant time.

```cpp
vector<bool> canEat(vector<int>& candiesCount, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<bool> result;
    vector<int> prefixSum(candiesCount.size() + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < candiesCount.size(); i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + candiesCount[i];
    }
    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int day = query[0];
        int candyType = query[1];
        if (prefixSum[day + 1] >= candyType + 1) {
            result.push_back(true);
        } else {
            result.push_back(false);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the number of days and $m$ is the number of queries. This is because we're calculating the prefix sum array in linear time, and then answering each query in constant time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, excluding the space required for the output array. This is because we're storing the prefix sum array, which has the same length as the input array.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because we're only calculating the prefix sum array once, and then using it to answer each query in constant time. This is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Prefix sum arrays, optimization techniques.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using prefix sum arrays to avoid recalculating values.
- Optimization techniques learned: Calculating prefix sum arrays only once to avoid redundant calculations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve calculating prefix sum arrays, such as range sum queries.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not initializing the prefix sum array correctly, not using the prefix sum array to answer queries.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where the input array is empty, or where the favorite candy type is not available.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that recalculates the total number of candies for each query.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input arrays and queries to ensure it works correctly.
