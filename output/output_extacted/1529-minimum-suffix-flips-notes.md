## Minimum Suffix Flips
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-suffix-flips/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes a binary string `s` of length `n` as input.
- Expected output format: The goal is to find the minimum number of suffix flips to make all suffixes of the string have an equal number of `0`s and `1`s.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handle cases where the input string is empty or has a length of 1. Also, consider the scenario where the string consists entirely of `0`s or `1`s.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given the string `"111000"`, the minimum number of suffix flips is 2.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves checking all possible suffixes of the string and counting the number of `0`s and `1`s in each suffix.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 
  1. Generate all possible suffixes of the input string.
  2. For each suffix, count the number of `0`s and `1`s.
  3. Calculate the absolute difference between the counts of `0`s and `1`s for each suffix.
  4. Sum up these differences to get the total number of suffix flips.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
int minFlips(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int minFlips = INT_MAX;
    
    // Iterate over all possible prefixes of the string
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        int flips = 0;
        
        // Iterate over the suffixes
        for (int j = i; j <= n; j++) {
            int zeros = 0, ones = 0;
            
            // Count the number of 0s and 1s in the current suffix
            for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
                if (s[k] == '0') zeros++;
                else ones++;
            }
            
            // Calculate the absolute difference between the counts of 0s and 1s
            flips += abs(zeros - ones);
        }
        
        // Update the minimum number of flips
        minFlips = min(minFlips, flips);
    }
    
    return minFlips;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string. This is because we are iterating over all possible prefixes, suffixes, and then counting the number of `0`s and `1`s in each suffix.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the minimum number of flips and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity occurs due to the nested loops, which result in a cubic time complexity. The space complexity is low because we are not using any data structures that scale with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all possible suffixes and counting the number of `0`s and `1`s, we can use a single pass through the string to calculate the minimum number of suffix flips.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach: 
  1. Initialize variables to keep track of the number of `0`s and `1`s in the string.
  2. Iterate through the string, updating the counts of `0`s and `1`s.
  3. At each position, calculate the absolute difference between the counts of `0`s and `1`s.
  4. Update the minimum number of flips based on the calculated difference.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the string, resulting in a linear time complexity.

```cpp
int minFlips(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int zeros = 0, ones = 0;
    int minFlips = 0;
    
    // Iterate through the string
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Update the counts of 0s and 1s
        if (s[i] == '0') zeros++;
        else ones++;
        
        // Calculate the absolute difference between the counts of 0s and 1s
        int flips = abs(zeros - ones);
        
        // Update the minimum number of flips
        minFlips = min(minFlips, flips);
    }
    
    return minFlips;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string. This is because we are only iterating through the string once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the counts of `0`s and `1`s and the minimum number of flips.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it achieves a linear time complexity, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: The problem demonstrates the importance of iterating through the input string only once to achieve optimal time complexity.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem requires identifying the minimum number of suffix flips, which involves calculating the absolute difference between the counts of `0`s and `1`s.
- Optimization techniques learned: The optimal approach demonstrates the use of a single pass through the string to calculate the minimum number of suffix flips.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems that involve iterating through a string and calculating minimum or maximum values.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to initialize variables or not updating the counts of `0`s and `1`s correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Handling cases where the input string is empty or has a length of 1.
- Performance pitfalls: Using nested loops or generating all possible suffixes, which can result in high time complexities.
- Testing considerations: Testing the function with different input strings, including edge cases, to ensure it produces the correct output.
