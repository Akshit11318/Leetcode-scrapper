## Chalkboard XOR Game
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/chalkboard-xor-game/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem takes an integer array `chalk` of length `n` as input, where `n` is a power of 2.
- Expected output format: The function should return `true` if the current player will win the game, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The game starts with the current player, and in each turn, the player can choose any number from the `chalk` array and replace it with its XOR with all the other numbers in the array. The game ends when the `chalk` array is empty. The current player wins if the final XOR of all numbers in the `chalk` array is not zero.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `chalk = [1,1,2]`, Output: `false`. Explanation: The first player can choose any number and replace it with its XOR with the other two numbers. Since the XOR of all three numbers is zero, the first player will lose.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves simulating all possible games and checking if the current player can win in any of them.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible subsets of the `chalk` array.
  2. For each subset, calculate the XOR of all numbers in the subset.
  3. If the XOR is not zero, the current player can win by choosing the numbers in the subset.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is often the first solution that comes to mind because it directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool xorGame(vector<int>& chalk) {
        int n = chalk.size();
        int totalXor = 0;
        for (int num : chalk) {
            totalXor ^= num;
        }
        if (totalXor == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int newXor = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    newXor ^= chalk[j];
                }
            }
            if (newXor == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the `chalk` array. This is because we are iterating over the array for each number in the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the XOR of all numbers.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we are simulating all possible games, and the space complexity occurs because we are only using a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The key insight is that the current player can win if and only if the XOR of all numbers in the `chalk` array is zero, or if the length of the `chalk` array is a multiple of 4.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Calculate the XOR of all numbers in the `chalk` array.
  2. If the XOR is zero, the current player can win.
  3. If the length of the `chalk` array is a multiple of 4, the current player can win.
- Proof of optimality: This solution is optimal because it directly addresses the problem statement and does not require any unnecessary calculations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool xorGame(vector<int>& chalk) {
        int n = chalk.size();
        int totalXor = 0;
        for (int num : chalk) {
            totalXor ^= num;
        }
        return totalXor == 0 || (n % 4 == 0);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the `chalk` array. This is because we are iterating over the array once to calculate the XOR of all numbers.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the XOR of all numbers.
> - **Optimality proof:** This solution is optimal because it directly addresses the problem statement and does not require any unnecessary calculations.
