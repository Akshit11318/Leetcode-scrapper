## Array Wrapper
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/array-wrapper/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: The problem doesn't explicitly state the input format. However, based on the description, we can assume that we are dealing with an array of integers and the operations to be performed on this array.
- Expected output format: The output will be the result of the operations performed on the array.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: We need to consider edge cases such as an empty array, an array with a single element, and an array with duplicate elements.
- Example test cases with explanations: 
    - `ArrayWrapper([1, 2, 3])` should return an object that supports indexing, slicing, and other array operations.
    - `ArrayWrapper([1, 2, 3])[1]` should return `2`.
    - `ArrayWrapper([1, 2, 3])[1:3]` should return `[2, 3]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To solve this problem, we can create a class that wraps the given array and provides methods for indexing, slicing, and other array operations.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    1. Create a class `ArrayWrapper` with a constructor that takes an array as input.
    2. Implement the `__getitem__` method to support indexing and slicing.
    3. Implement other methods to support additional array operations.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and allows us to create a custom class that meets the problem requirements.

```cpp
class ArrayWrapper {
private:
    vector<int> arr;
public:
    ArrayWrapper(vector<int> arr) {
        this->arr = arr;
    }
    
    int operator[](int index) {
        return arr[index];
    }
    
    vector<int> slice(int start, int end) {
        vector<int> result;
        for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
            result.push_back(arr[i]);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, because we are iterating over the array in the `slice` method.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, because we are storing the array in the `ArrayWrapper` class.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we are using a vector to store the array and iterating over it to perform operations.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the `std::vector` class in C++ to create a wrapper class that supports indexing, slicing, and other array operations.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
    1. Create a class `ArrayWrapper` with a constructor that takes an array as input.
    2. Use the `std::vector` class to store the array.
    3. Implement the `operator[]` method to support indexing.
    4. Implement the `slice` method to support slicing.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it uses the built-in `std::vector` class, which provides efficient and optimized methods for array operations.
- Why further optimization is impossible: Further optimization is impossible because we are using the most efficient data structure available in C++ for array operations.

```cpp
class ArrayWrapper {
private:
    vector<int> arr;
public:
    ArrayWrapper(vector<int> arr) {
        this->arr = arr;
    }
    
    int operator[](int index) {
        return arr[index];
    }
    
    vector<int> slice(int start, int end) {
        return vector<int>(arr.begin() + start, arr.begin() + end);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k)$, where $k$ is the number of elements in the slice, because we are using the `std::vector` constructor to create a new vector for the slice.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, because we are creating a new vector for the slice.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it uses the most efficient data structure available in C++ for array operations and minimizes the number of copies made.
