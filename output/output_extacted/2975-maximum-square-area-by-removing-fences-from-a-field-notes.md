## Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences from a Field

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-square-area-by-removing-fences-from-a-field/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer array `fences` representing the heights of fences.
- Constraints: The length of `fences` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`, and each element in `fences` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- Expected Output: The maximum area of a square that can be formed by removing fences from the field.
- Key Requirements and Edge Cases:
  - The input array is not empty.
  - All elements in the input array are positive integers.
  - The maximum area should be calculated based on the minimum height of the fences.
- Example Test Cases:
  - Input: `fences = [4, 2, 5, 3]`, Output: `4`
  - Input: `fences = [1, 1, 1]`, Output: `3`

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves iterating over all possible subarrays of the input array and calculating the area of the square that can be formed by removing fences from each subarray.
- The step-by-step breakdown of the solution involves:
  1. Generating all possible subarrays of the input array.
  2. For each subarray, calculating the minimum height of the fences.
  3. Calculating the area of the square that can be formed by removing fences from the subarray based on the minimum height.
  4. Keeping track of the maximum area found so far.

```cpp
int maxArea(vector<int>& fences) {
    int maxArea = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < fences.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < fences.size(); j++) {
            int minHeight = INT_MAX;
            for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                minHeight = min(minHeight, fences[k]);
            }
            maxArea = max(maxArea, minHeight * (j - i + 1));
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because we are generating all possible subarrays of the input array, and for each subarray, we are calculating the minimum height of the fences.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach involves generating all possible subarrays of the input array, which results in a time complexity of $O(n^3)$. The space complexity is $O(1)$ because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The key insight that leads to the optimal solution is that we can use a two-pointer technique to find the maximum area of the square that can be formed by removing fences from the field.
- The step-by-step breakdown of the approach involves:
  1. Initializing two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the input array.
  2. Calculating the minimum height of the fences between the `left` and `right` pointers.
  3. Calculating the area of the square that can be formed by removing fences from the subarray between the `left` and `right` pointers based on the minimum height.
  4. Moving the `right` pointer to the right to increase the width of the square, and updating the `left` pointer if necessary to maintain the minimum height.

```cpp
int maxArea(vector<int>& fences) {
    int maxArea = 0;
    for (int left = 0; left < fences.size(); left++) {
        int minHeight = fences[left];
        for (int right = left; right < fences.size(); right++) {
            minHeight = min(minHeight, fences[right]);
            maxArea = max(maxArea, minHeight * (right - left + 1));
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array. This is because we are using a two-pointer technique to find the maximum area of the square that can be formed by removing fences from the field.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem. This is because we need to consider all possible subarrays of the input array to find the maximum area of the square that can be formed by removing fences from the field.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: two-pointer technique, dynamic programming.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: finding the maximum area of a square that can be formed by removing fences from a field.
- Optimization techniques learned: reducing the time complexity from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$ using a two-pointer technique.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not initializing variables correctly, not handling edge cases properly.
- Edge cases to watch for: empty input array, input array with a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: using a brute force approach with a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: testing the solution with different input sizes and edge cases.
