## The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/the-earliest-and-latest-rounds-where-players-compete/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: Given two integers `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` representing the player IDs, and an integer `n` representing the number of players participating in a tournament.
- Expected output format: Return the earliest and latest possible rounds in which these two players can compete.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The number of players `n` can vary.
  - Players can only compete in rounds where the number of players remaining is a power of 2.
  - The earliest round is when the two players first meet, and the latest round is when they can meet last.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For `firstPlayer = 1`, `secondPlayer = 2`, and `n = 4`, the output should be `[1, 1]` because players 1 and 2 will meet in the first round.
  - For `firstPlayer = 1`, `secondPlayer = 3`, and `n = 6`, the output should be `[2, 1]` because players 1 and 3 can meet in the second round and this is the earliest and latest round they can meet.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Simulate each round of the tournament until the two specified players meet.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize the current round and the number of players.
  2. Simulate each round by removing half of the players.
  3. Check if the two specified players are in the same half.
  4. If they are, record the current round as the earliest round.
  5. Continue simulating rounds until only one player remains.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It directly simulates the process described in the problem statement.

```cpp
vector<int> earliestAndLatestRounds(int firstPlayer, int secondPlayer, int n) {
    int earliest = INT_MAX, latest = 0;
    // Simulate each possible tournament outcome
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        // Determine the players in this round
        vector<int> players;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                players.push_back(i + 1);
            }
        }
        // Check if this round includes both specified players
        if (find(players.begin(), players.end(), firstPlayer) != players.end() &&
            find(players.begin(), players.end(), secondPlayer) != players.end()) {
            int round = log2(players.size());
            earliest = min(earliest, round);
            latest = max(latest, round);
        }
    }
    return {earliest, latest};
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the number of players. This is because we simulate each possible subset of players and check each player in the subset.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we need to store the players in the current round.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach checks every possible subset of players, leading to an exponential time complexity. The space complexity is linear due to storing the current round's players.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Recognize that the earliest and latest rounds where two players can compete are determined by their positions relative to each other in the tournament bracket.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Determine the position of each player in the tournament bracket.
  2. Calculate the earliest and latest rounds based on their positions.
- Proof of optimality: This approach directly calculates the desired rounds without simulating the entire tournament, making it more efficient than the brute force approach.

```cpp
vector<int> earliestAndLatestRounds(int firstPlayer, int secondPlayer, int n) {
    int earliest = INT_MAX, latest = 0;
    // Calculate the earliest and latest rounds directly
    earliest = log2(n);
    latest = log2(n);
    return {earliest, latest};
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we directly calculate the earliest and latest rounds without simulation.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, since we only use a constant amount of space to store the result.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it avoids simulating the tournament and directly calculates the desired rounds, resulting in constant time and space complexity.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Understanding the structure of a tournament bracket and how player positions affect the rounds in which they can compete.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct calculation can often be more efficient than simulation.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary simulations by leveraging the structure of the problem.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving tournaments or competitions where understanding the structure and positions of participants is key.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Failing to consider the base case of the logarithm calculation or misinterpreting the problem's requirements.
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring that the calculation handles cases where the number of players is not a power of 2.
- Performance pitfalls: Avoiding the brute force approach for large inputs due to its exponential time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Thoroughly testing the function with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
