## Query Batching

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/query-batching/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input consists of a list of `queries` where each query is a list of integers representing the time at which the query is sent and the time it takes to process the query. The queries are processed in batches, and the goal is to find the maximum batch size such that the total processing time of the queries in the batch does not exceed the time limit.
- Expected output format: The output should be the maximum batch size.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The queries are processed in the order they are received, and each query can only be processed once.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `queries = [[1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 3]]`, `time_limit = 5`. The maximum batch size is 2 because we can process the first two queries in the first batch and the third query in the second batch.
  - Example 2: `queries = [[1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 3]]`, `time_limit = 2`. The maximum batch size is 1 because we can only process one query in each batch.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible batch sizes and check if the total processing time of the queries in the batch does not exceed the time limit.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Iterate over all possible batch sizes from 1 to the number of queries.
  2. For each batch size, try all possible combinations of queries.
  3. For each combination, calculate the total processing time and check if it does not exceed the time limit.
  4. If it does not exceed the time limit, update the maximum batch size.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it is not efficient because it has a high time complexity.

```cpp
int maxBatchSize(vector<vector<int>>& queries, int time_limit) {
    int n = queries.size();
    int max_batch_size = 0;
    for (int batch_size = 1; batch_size <= n; batch_size++) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - batch_size; i++) {
            int total_time = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < i + batch_size; j++) {
                total_time += queries[j][1];
            }
            if (total_time <= time_limit) {
                max_batch_size = max(max_batch_size, batch_size);
            }
        }
    }
    return max_batch_size;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of queries. This is because we have three nested loops.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum batch size and the total processing time.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The high time complexity occurs because we try all possible combinations of queries, which results in a cubic time complexity.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the total processing time of the queries in the batch.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the queries array.
  2. Initialize the total processing time and the maximum batch size.
  3. Move the `right` pointer to the right and add the processing time of the query at the `right` pointer to the total processing time.
  4. If the total processing time exceeds the time limit, move the `left` pointer to the right and subtract the processing time of the query at the `left` pointer from the total processing time.
  5. Update the maximum batch size if the current batch size is larger.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through the queries array and uses a constant amount of space.

```cpp
int maxBatchSize(vector<vector<int>>& queries, int time_limit) {
    int n = queries.size();
    int max_batch_size = 0;
    int left = 0;
    int total_time = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        total_time += queries[right][1];
        while (total_time > time_limit) {
            total_time -= queries[left][1];
            left++;
        }
        max_batch_size = max(max_batch_size, right - left + 1);
    }
    return max_batch_size;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Sliding window approach, two-pointer technique.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Using a sliding window to efficiently calculate the total processing time of the queries in the batch.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary calculations by using a sliding window approach.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems that require calculating the maximum or minimum value of a function over a range of values.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not updating the maximum batch size correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Queries with zero processing time, queries with negative processing time.
- Performance pitfalls: Using a brute force approach that has a high time complexity.
- Testing considerations: Test the function with different inputs, including edge cases and large inputs.
