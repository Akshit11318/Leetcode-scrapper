## Maximize Number of Nice Divisors
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-number-of-nice-divisors/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: An integer `n`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
- Expected output format: The maximum number of nice divisors for `n`.
- Key requirements: Find the maximum number of nice divisors for `n` by possibly replacing some `3`'s with `2`'s.
- Example test cases:
  - Input: `n = 12`
  - Output: `6`
  - Explanation: `12` has `6` nice divisors: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]`.
  - Input: `n = 21`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: `21` has `5` nice divisors: `[1, 3, 7, 21]`. Replacing `3` with `2` does not increase the number of divisors.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Enumerate all factors of `n` and check if they are nice divisors.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty list to store nice divisors.
  2. Iterate over all numbers from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
  3. For each number, check if it is a divisor of `n`.
  4. If it is a divisor and a nice divisor, add it to the list.
  5. Return the size of the list as the maximum number of nice divisors.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is straightforward and directly addresses the problem statement.

```cpp
int maxNiceDivisors(int n) {
    // Initialize variables
    vector<int> divisors;
    
    // Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // Check if i is a divisor of n
        if (n % i == 0) {
            // Check if i is a nice divisor
            if (isNice(i)) {
                divisors.push_back(i);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Return the size of the list as the maximum number of nice divisors
    return divisors.size();
}

// Helper function to check if a number is a nice divisor
bool isNice(int num) {
    // A number is nice if it only has prime factors of 2, 3, or 5
    while (num > 1) {
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            num /= 2;
        } else if (num % 3 == 0) {
            num /= 3;
        } else if (num % 5 == 0) {
            num /= 5;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \log n)$, where $n$ is the input number. This is because we iterate over all numbers up to $n$ and for each number, we perform a primality test that takes $O(\log n)$ time.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we store all divisors in a list.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach is inefficient because it involves iterating over all numbers up to $n$ and performing a primality test for each number.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight: The maximum number of nice divisors for a given number can be obtained by finding the optimal combination of prime factors `2` and `3`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. If `n` is less than or equal to `3`, return `n`.
  2. If `n` is `4`, return `3`.
  3. For `n` greater than `4`, calculate the maximum number of nice divisors by finding the optimal combination of `2`s and `3`s.
- Proof of optimality: The optimal approach ensures that we always choose the combination of prime factors that results in the maximum number of divisors.

```cpp
int maxNiceDivisors(int n) {
    if (n <= 3) return n;
    if (n == 4) return 3;
    
    int res = 0;
    if (n % 3 == 0) {
        res = (n / 3) / 2 * 2 * 3;
    } else if (n % 3 == 1) {
        res = (n / 3 - 1) / 2 * 2 * 3 * 2;
    } else {
        res = (n / 3) / 2 * 2 * 2 * 3;
    }
    
    return res;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the optimal approach only involves a constant number of operations.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the optimal approach only uses a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach is optimal because it always chooses the combination of prime factors that results in the maximum number of divisors.
