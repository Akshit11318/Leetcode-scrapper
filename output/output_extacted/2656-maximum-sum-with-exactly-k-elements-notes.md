## Maximum Sum with Exactly K Elements

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-with-exactly-k-elements/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The problem involves finding the maximum sum that can be obtained by selecting exactly `k` elements from a given array of integers. The array is not sorted, and there are no constraints on the range of values in the array.
- Expected output format: The maximum sum that can be obtained by selecting exactly `k` elements.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider:
  - The array may contain duplicate elements.
  - The array may contain negative numbers.
  - The value of `k` may be equal to the length of the array.
  - The value of `k` may be greater than the length of the array, in which case the problem has no solution.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3`. The maximum sum is `1 + 4 + 5 = 10`.
  - Example 2: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2`. The maximum sum is `4 + 5 = 9`.
  - Example 3: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 6`. The maximum sum does not exist since `k` is greater than the length of the array.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves generating all possible combinations of `k` elements from the given array and calculating their sums.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of `k` elements from the array using a recursive function or a loop.
  2. For each combination, calculate the sum of its elements.
  3. Keep track of the maximum sum found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: The brute force approach is straightforward and easy to understand. It involves exploring all possible solutions and selecting the best one.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void backtrack(vector<int>& nums, int k, int start, vector<int>& current, int& max_sum) {
    if (current.size() == k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : current) {
            sum += num;
        }
        max_sum = max(max_sum, sum);
        return;
    }

    for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        current.push_back(nums[i]);
        backtrack(nums, k, i + 1, current, max_sum);
        current.pop_back();
    }
}

int maximum_sum_with_k_elements(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    if (k > nums.size()) {
        return -1; // or throw an exception
    }

    int max_sum = INT_MIN;
    vector<int> current;
    backtrack(nums, k, 0, current, max_sum);
    return max_sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(\binom{n}{k} \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of the array and $k$ is the number of elements to select. This is because we generate all possible combinations of `k` elements and calculate their sums.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, which is the maximum depth of the recursion tree. We also use a vector to store the current combination, which requires $O(k)$ space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity occurs because we generate all possible combinations of `k` elements, which has a time complexity of $O(\binom{n}{k})$. We also calculate the sum of each combination, which takes $O(k)$ time. The space complexity occurs because we use a recursive function, which requires $O(k)$ space on the call stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: The optimal solution involves sorting the array in descending order and selecting the first `k` elements.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Sort the array in descending order using a sorting algorithm such as quicksort or mergesort.
  2. Select the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
  3. Calculate the sum of the selected elements.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it selects the `k` largest elements from the array, which maximizes the sum.

```cpp
int maximum_sum_with_k_elements(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    if (k > nums.size()) {
        return -1; // or throw an exception
    }

    sort(nums.rbegin(), nums.rend());
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. This is because we sort the array using a sorting algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, which is the space required by the sorting algorithm. We also use a variable to store the sum, which requires $O(1)$ space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it selects the `k` largest elements from the array, which maximizes the sum. The time complexity is also optimal because we cannot sort the array faster than $O(n \log n)$.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: sorting, selection, and recursion.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: generating all possible combinations, selecting the best solution, and using a recursive function.
- Optimization techniques learned: sorting the array to select the largest elements, using a recursive function to generate combinations.
- Similar problems to practice: finding the maximum sum of a subarray, finding the minimum sum of a subarray, and finding the maximum product of a subarray.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not checking for edge cases, not validating the input, and not handling errors correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: the value of `k` is greater than the length of the array, the array is empty, and the array contains duplicate elements.
- Performance pitfalls: using a recursive function with a large depth, not optimizing the sorting algorithm, and not using a efficient data structure to store the combinations.
- Testing considerations: testing the function with different inputs, testing the function with edge cases, and testing the function with large inputs.
