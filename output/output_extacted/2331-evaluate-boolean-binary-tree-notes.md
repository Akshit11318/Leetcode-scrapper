## Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-boolean-binary-tree/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: The root of a binary tree where each node has a value of `0`, `1`, or `2`, and a boolean value of `true` or `false` in its children.
- Constraints: The tree contains between 1 and 100 nodes, and each node has a value of `0`, `1`, or `2`.
- Expected Output: `true` if the boolean expression represented by the tree evaluates to `true`, and `false` otherwise.
- Key Requirements: Handle edge cases such as an empty tree, a tree with a single node, or a tree with nodes having values other than `0`, `1`, or `2`.
- Example Test Cases:
  - Example 1: 
    ```
    Input: root = [2,1,3,0,1,1,3,0,1]
    Output: true
    ```
  - Example 2: 
    ```
    Input: root = [0]
    Output: false
    ```

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to traverse the tree and evaluate the boolean expression at each node.
- We can use a recursive approach to traverse the tree and evaluate the expression.
- This approach comes to mind first because it directly addresses the problem statement and is easy to implement.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool evaluateTree(TreeNode* root) {
        // Base case: if the node is null, return false
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // If the node's value is 0 or 1, return the corresponding boolean value
        if (root->val == 0) {
            return false;
        } else if (root->val == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // If the node's value is 2, recursively evaluate the left and right subtrees
        // and return the result of the corresponding boolean operation
        if (root->val == 2) {
            return evaluateTree(root->left) || evaluateTree(root->right);
        }
        
        // If the node's value is 3, recursively evaluate the left and right subtrees
        // and return the result of the corresponding boolean operation
        if (root->val == 3) {
            return evaluateTree(root->left) && evaluateTree(root->right);
        }
        
        // If the node's value is not 0, 1, 2, or 3, return false
        return false;
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree, because we visit each node once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree, because of the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we visit each node once, and the space complexity is proportional to the height of the tree because of the recursive call stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach is similar to the brute force approach, but we can simplify the code by using a more concise way to handle the node's value.
- We can use a recursive approach to traverse the tree and evaluate the expression.
- This approach is optimal because it directly addresses the problem statement and has a time complexity of $O(n)$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool evaluateTree(TreeNode* root) {
        // Base case: if the node is null, return false
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // If the node's value is 0 or 1, return the corresponding boolean value
        if (root->val == 0 || root->val == 1) {
            return root->val == 1;
        }
        
        // If the node's value is 2, recursively evaluate the left and right subtrees
        // and return the result of the corresponding boolean operation
        if (root->val == 2) {
            return evaluateTree(root->left) || evaluateTree(root->right);
        }
        
        // If the node's value is 3, recursively evaluate the left and right subtrees
        // and return the result of the corresponding boolean operation
        if (root->val == 3) {
            return evaluateTree(root->left) && evaluateTree(root->right);
        }
        
        // If the node's value is not 0, 1, 2, or 3, return false
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: recursive tree traversal and boolean expression evaluation.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using recursive approaches to solve problems that involve tree traversals.
- Optimization techniques learned: simplifying code to improve readability and maintainability.
- Similar problems to practice: other tree traversal problems, such as binary tree inorder traversal or binary tree postorder traversal.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: forgetting to handle edge cases, such as an empty tree or a tree with a single node.
- Edge cases to watch for: nodes with values other than `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`.
- Performance pitfalls: using inefficient recursive approaches that result in high time or space complexities.
- Testing considerations: testing the code with different input cases, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
