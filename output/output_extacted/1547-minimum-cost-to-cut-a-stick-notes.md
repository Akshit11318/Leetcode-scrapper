**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-cut-a-stick/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a list of integers representing the cuts on a stick, including the ends. The list is sorted in ascending order.
- Expected output format: The minimum cost to cut the stick at all the given cuts.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input list must contain at least two elements, representing the ends of the stick. The list must be sorted in ascending order.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: Input: `sticks = [1,2,3,4]`, Output: `4`, Explanation: The stick can be cut at all the given cuts with a minimum cost of 4.
  - Example 2: Input: `sticks = [1,3,5]`, Output: `5`, Explanation: The stick can be cut at all the given cuts with a minimum cost of 5.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To find the minimum cost to cut the stick, we can try all possible ways to cut the stick and calculate the cost for each way.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible ways to cut the stick.
  2. For each way, calculate the cost by summing up the lengths of all the sticks after cutting.
  3. Keep track of the minimum cost found so far.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it has an exponential time complexity due to the generation of all possible ways to cut the stick.

```cpp
int minCost(vector<int>& sticks) {
    int n = sticks.size();
    vector<int> lengths;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        lengths.push_back(sticks[i + 1] - sticks[i]);
    }
    int minCost = INT_MAX;
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << (n - 1)); mask++) {
        int cost = 0;
        int start = sticks[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                cost += sticks[i + 1] - start;
                start = sticks[i + 1];
            }
        }
        cost += sticks[n - 1] - start;
        minCost = min(minCost, cost);
    }
    return minCost;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{n-1})$, where $n$ is the number of sticks. This is because we generate all possible ways to cut the stick, which is $2^{n-1}$.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of sticks. This is because we store the lengths of all the sticks after cutting.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The exponential time complexity occurs because we generate all possible ways to cut the stick. The space complexity occurs because we store the lengths of all the sticks after cutting.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to divide the stick into two parts and calculate the minimum cost for each part separately.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to store the minimum cost for each subproblem.
  2. For each subproblem, try all possible ways to cut the stick and calculate the cost for each way.
  3. Update the `dp` array with the minimum cost found for each subproblem.
- Proof of optimality: The dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to cut the stick and calculate the minimum cost for each subproblem. This leads to an optimal solution.
- Why further optimization is impossible: The dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

```cpp
int minCost(vector<int>& sticks) {
    int n = sticks.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    for (int length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
            int j = i + length - 1;
            dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
            for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j] + sticks[j] - sticks[i]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[0][n - 1];
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of sticks. This is because we use three nested loops to fill up the `dp` array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of sticks. This is because we store the minimum cost for each subproblem in the `dp` array.
> - **Optimality proof:** The dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to cut the stick and calculate the minimum cost for each subproblem. This leads to an optimal solution.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Dynamic programming, divide and conquer.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: The problem can be divided into smaller subproblems and solved using dynamic programming.
- Optimization techniques learned: Dynamic programming can be used to optimize the solution by avoiding redundant calculations.
- Similar problems to practice: Other dynamic programming problems, such as the Fibonacci sequence, the longest common subsequence, and the shortest path problem.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect initialization of the `dp` array, incorrect calculation of the minimum cost for each subproblem.
- Edge cases to watch for: The input list must contain at least two elements, representing the ends of the stick. The list must be sorted in ascending order.
- Performance pitfalls: The brute force approach has an exponential time complexity, which can lead to performance issues for large inputs.
- Testing considerations: Test the solution with different inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it works correctly.
