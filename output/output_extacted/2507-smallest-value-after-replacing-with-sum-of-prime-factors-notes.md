## Smallest Value after Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-value-after-replacing-with-sum-of-prime-factors/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `n`.
- Expected Output: The smallest possible value that can be obtained by replacing `n` with the sum of its prime factors.
- Key Requirements:
  - Find all prime factors of `n`.
  - Replace `n` with the sum of these prime factors.
  - Repeat this process until `n` is reduced to a single digit (i.e., `n` becomes less than 10) or it becomes a prime number itself.
- Example Test Cases:
  - For `n = 15`, its prime factors are 3 and 5. So, `15` becomes `3 + 5 = 8`.
  - For `n = 4`, its prime factors are 2 and 2. So, `4` becomes `2 + 2 = 4`. Since `4` is not a prime and greater than 9, continue the process: `4` becomes `2 + 2 = 4`, and it will remain `4` because its prime factors' sum is itself.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process involves directly finding the prime factors of the given number `n`, summing them up, and replacing `n` with this sum. Repeat this process until `n` is reduced to a single digit or it becomes a prime number.
- This approach requires checking for prime numbers and finding prime factors for each iteration until the condition is met.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool isPrime(int num) {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
        if (num % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Function to find prime factors and sum them up
int sumOfPrimeFactors(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        while (n % i == 0) {
            sum += i;
            n /= i;
        }
    }
    if (n > 1) sum += n; // If n itself is a prime number greater than 1
    return sum;
}

int smallestValue(int n) {
    while (n >= 10 && !isPrime(n)) {
        n = sumOfPrimeFactors(n);
    }
    return n;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Smallest value after replacing with sum of prime factors: " << smallestValue(n);
    return 0;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot \sqrt{n})$, where $k$ is the number of iterations until `n` is reduced to a single digit or becomes a prime, and $\sqrt{n}$ is the time to find prime factors in each iteration.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any additional space that scales with input size.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to the repeated process of finding prime factors and checking for primality, while the space complexity remains constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store our variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- The optimal approach involves the same basic idea as the brute force but optimizes the process by minimizing the number of iterations and using a more efficient method to check for prime numbers and find prime factors.
- However, for this specific problem, the process is inherently iterative and dependent on the properties of prime numbers and the given number `n`. Thus, the optimization primarily focuses on the efficient calculation of prime factors and the condition to stop the iteration.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to find prime factors and sum them up
int sumOfPrimeFactors(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        while (n % i == 0) {
            sum += i;
            n /= i;
        }
    }
    if (n > 1) sum += n; // If n itself is a prime number greater than 1
    return sum;
}

int smallestValue(int n) {
    while (n >= 10) {
        int original = n;
        n = sumOfPrimeFactors(n);
        if (n == original) break; // If n doesn't change, it's likely a prime or the process has converged
    }
    return n;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Smallest value after replacing with sum of prime factors: " << smallestValue(n);
    return 0;
}
```

> - **Time Complexity:** $O(k \cdot \sqrt{n})$, where $k$ is the number of iterations until `n` is reduced to a single digit or the process converges, and $\sqrt{n}$ is the time to find prime factors in each iteration.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we are not using any additional space that scales with input size.
> - **Optimality proof:** The process is optimized by directly calculating the sum of prime factors and stopping when `n` is reduced to a single digit or the process converges, indicating that `n` has reached a stable state, likely being a prime number or having its prime factors' sum equal to itself.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated include prime factorization, iterative processes, and optimization techniques.
- Problem-solving patterns identified involve breaking down complex problems into simpler, more manageable parts (e.g., finding prime factors).
- Optimization techniques learned include minimizing iterations and using efficient algorithms for prime factorization.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors include not properly checking for the base case (e.g., when `n` is less than 10) and not optimizing the loop for finding prime factors.
- Edge cases to watch for include when `n` is a prime number itself or when the sum of its prime factors equals `n`.
- Performance pitfalls include using inefficient algorithms for prime factorization or not stopping the iteration when `n` is reduced to a single digit or becomes a prime.
