## Generate a String with Characters That Have Odd Counts

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-a-string-with-characters-that-have-odd-counts/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: An integer `n`.
- Constraints: `1 <= n <= 100`.
- Expected output: A string of length `n` containing only lowercase English letters, with each character appearing an odd number of times.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The string must contain only lowercase letters, and each character must appear an odd number of times. For example, if `n = 3`, a valid output could be `"aba"`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `n = 3`, Output: `"aba"` (Here, 'a' appears 2 times which is even, but we need it to appear an odd number of times. However, 'b' appears once which is odd, and 'a' appears twice which is even. A correct output would be "aba" where we add an extra 'a' to make its count odd, but this is still incorrect as 'a' appears an even number of times. A correct example would be "aaa" where 'a' appears 3 times which is odd. So the correct output is indeed "aaa".)
  - Input: `n = 5`, Output: `"aabbb"` (In this case, 'a' appears once which is odd, and 'b' appears 3 times which is also odd.)

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The simplest approach to solving this problem would be to generate all possible strings of length `n` and check each one to see if it meets the condition.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible strings of length `n`.
  2. For each string, count the occurrences of each character.
  3. Check if all characters appear an odd number of times.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it is inefficient due to the large number of possible strings.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

void generate_string(int n) {
    // Generate all possible strings of length n
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << (n * 5)); i++) { // assuming 5 bits per character (26 letters)
        string s = "";
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int char_code = (i >> (j * 5)) & ((1 << 5) - 1); // get the 5-bit code for the current character
            char c = 'a' + char_code; // convert the code to a character
            s += c;
        }
        // Check if all characters appear an odd number of times
        bool valid = true;
        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                if (s[k] == c) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count > 0 && count % 2 == 0) { // if the character appears an even number of times
                valid = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (valid) {
            cout << s << endl;
            return;
        }
    }
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{5n} \cdot n)$, where $n$ is the input length. This is because we generate all possible strings of length $n$, and for each string, we count the occurrences of each character.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the input length. This is because we need to store the current string being generated.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is high due to the large number of possible strings, and the space complexity is relatively low because we only need to store a single string.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can construct the string by repeating a single character `n` times, ensuring that the character appears an odd number of times.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Choose a character, such as 'a'.
  2. Repeat the character `n` times to form the string.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it ensures that the chosen character appears an odd number of times, and it does so in the simplest possible way.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string generate_string(int n) {
    // Choose a character, such as 'a'
    char c = 'a';
    // Repeat the character n times to form the string
    string s(n, c);
    return s;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the input length. This is because we need to repeat the character `n` times.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the input length. This is because we need to store the resulting string.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it ensures that the chosen character appears an odd number of times, and it does so in the simplest possible way, with a linear time and space complexity.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: using unnecessary loops or conditional statements.
- Edge cases to watch for: ensuring that the input length `n` is handled correctly.
- Performance pitfalls: avoiding unnecessary complexity and focusing on simple, efficient solutions.
- Testing considerations: verifying that the output string meets the required conditions.
