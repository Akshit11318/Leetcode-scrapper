## Count the Number of Winning Sequences

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-winning-sequences/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input: A string `s` representing a sequence of '1's and '0's, and an integer `k`.
- Constraints: `1 <= k <= s.length()`, `s` consists only of '1's and '0's.
- Expected Output: The number of winning sequences of length `k` that can be formed from `s`.
- Key Requirements: A winning sequence is one where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to `k / 2`.
- Edge Cases: Empty string, `k` greater than the length of `s`, sequences with all '0's or all '1's.

**Example Test Cases:**
- Input: `s = "101", k = 2`, Output: `2` (Winning sequences: `"11", "10"`).
- Input: `s = "111", k = 3`, Output: `1` (Winning sequence: `"111"`).
- Input: `s = "000", k = 3`, Output: `0` (No winning sequences).

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Generate all possible sequences of length `k` from `s`.
- For each sequence, calculate the sum of its elements.
- If the sum is greater than or equal to `k / 2`, count it as a winning sequence.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int countWinningSequences(std::string s, int k) {
    int n = s.length();
    int count = 0;
    
    // Generate all sequences of length k
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
            if (s[j] == '1') sum++;
        }
        if (sum >= k / 2) count++;
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the length of `s` and $k$ is the length of the sequences.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is due to generating all sequences of length `k` and calculating their sums. The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of space to store the count and sum variables.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Since we are looking for sequences of length `k`, and a sequence is considered winning if the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to `k / 2`, we can use a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the sum of each sequence.
- Initialize a window of size `k` at the beginning of `s`.
- Calculate the sum of the elements in the window.
- If the sum is greater than or equal to `k / 2`, count it as a winning sequence.
- Slide the window to the right by one element and update the sum.
- Repeat this process until the window reaches the end of `s`.

```cpp
int countWinningSequences(std::string s, int k) {
    int n = s.length();
    int count = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    
    // Initialize the window
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        if (s[i] == '1') sum++;
    }
    
    // Slide the window
    for (int i = k; i <= n; i++) {
        if (sum >= k / 2) count++;
        if (i < n) {
            if (s[i - k] == '1') sum--;
            if (s[i] == '1') sum++;
        }
    }
    
    // Count the last window
    if (sum >= k / 2) count++;
    
    return count;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach is optimal because it only requires a single pass through `s`, and it uses a constant amount of space. The sliding window approach allows us to efficiently calculate the sum of each sequence of length `k` without having to regenerate each sequence.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- The importance of understanding the problem constraints and identifying key requirements.
- The use of a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the sum of each sequence.
- The optimization of the brute force approach to reduce the time complexity.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not considering the edge cases, such as an empty string or `k` greater than the length of `s`.
- Not optimizing the brute force approach, which can lead to inefficient solutions.
- Not using a sliding window approach, which can simplify the calculation of the sum of each sequence.
