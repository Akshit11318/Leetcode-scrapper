## Maximum Alternating Subarray Sum
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-alternating-subarray-sum/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Given an array of integers `nums`, find the maximum alternating subarray sum.
- The input array `nums` contains integers, and the length of `nums` is denoted as `n`.
- The expected output is the maximum alternating subarray sum.
- Key requirements: The alternating subarray sum is calculated by adding and subtracting elements alternately.
- Edge cases: Handle empty arrays and arrays with a single element.

**Example Test Cases:**
- For the input `nums = [4, 2, 5, 3]`, the maximum alternating subarray sum is `7`, which is obtained by the subarray `[4, -2, 5]`.
- For the input `nums = [5, 6, 7, 8]`, the maximum alternating subarray sum is `8`, which is obtained by the subarray `[8]`.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- The initial thought process is to generate all possible subarrays and calculate their alternating sums.
- For each subarray, iterate through the elements and calculate the alternating sum.
- Keep track of the maximum alternating sum found so far.

```cpp
int maxAlternatingSum(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            int sum = 0;
            int sign = 1;
            for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                sum += sign * nums[k];
                sign *= -1;
            }
            maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
        }
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we have three nested loops: one for generating subarrays, one for iterating through the subarray, and one for calculating the alternating sum.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of space to store the maximum sum and other variables.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The brute force approach has a high time complexity due to the nested loops, which makes it inefficient for large inputs.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- The key insight is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum alternating sum ending at each position.
- We maintain two arrays, `dp_max` and `dp_min`, where `dp_max[i]` represents the maximum alternating sum ending at position `i` with a positive sign, and `dp_min[i]` represents the maximum alternating sum ending at position `i` with a negative sign.
- We iterate through the array and update `dp_max` and `dp_min` based on the maximum alternating sum ending at the previous position.

```cpp
int maxAlternatingSum(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> dp_max(n), dp_min(n);
    dp_max[0] = nums[0];
    dp_min[0] = -nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        dp_max[i] = max(dp_min[i - 1] + nums[i], nums[i]);
        dp_min[i] = max(dp_max[i - 1] - nums[i], -nums[i]);
    }
    return *max_element(dp_max.begin(), dp_max.end());
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we have a single loop that iterates through the array.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, as we use two arrays of size `n` to store the maximum alternating sums.
> - **Optimality proof:** The optimal approach has a linear time complexity, which is the best possible complexity for this problem, as we need to at least read the input array once.

### Final Notes
**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: dynamic programming, alternating sums.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: using arrays to keep track of maximum sums, iterating through the array to update the maximum sums.
- Optimization techniques learned: avoiding nested loops, using dynamic programming to reduce time complexity.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: not initializing variables correctly, not handling edge cases properly.
- Edge cases to watch for: empty arrays, arrays with a single element.
- Performance pitfalls: using nested loops, not using dynamic programming.
- Testing considerations: testing with different input sizes, testing with different input values.
