## Rotating the Box
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/rotating-the-box/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: The input is a 2D array `box` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (stone), and an integer `rows` representing the number of rows in the resulting rotated box, and an integer `cols` representing the number of columns in the resulting rotated box.
- Expected output format: A 2D array representing the rotated box.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The input `box` is guaranteed to be non-empty, and the number of rows in the rotated box times the number of columns in the rotated box is equal to the total number of cells in the input `box`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Input: `box = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,0,0]]`, `rows = 2`, `cols = 3`
  - Output: `[[1,0,0],[0,0,1]]`
  - Explanation: The input `box` is rotated to match the given number of rows and columns.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: The brute force approach involves iterating over each cell in the input `box` and manually rotating it to match the desired number of rows and columns.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Initialize an empty 2D array `rotatedBox` with the given number of rows and columns.
  2. Iterate over each cell in the input `box`.
  3. For each cell, calculate its new position in the rotated box based on the number of rows and columns.
  4. Place the cell in its new position in the `rotatedBox`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach is straightforward and involves directly manipulating the input data to achieve the desired output.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> rotateTheBox(vector<vector<int>>& box, int rows, int cols) {
    int m = box.size();
    int n = box[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> rotatedBox(rows, vector<int>(cols, 0));
    int index = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int newRow = index / cols;
            int newCol = index % cols;
            rotatedBox[newRow][newCol] = box[i][j];
            index++;
        }
    }
    return rotatedBox;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows in the input `box` and $n$ is the number of columns in the input `box`. This is because we iterate over each cell in the input `box` once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows in the input `box` and $n$ is the number of columns in the input `box`. This is because we create a new 2D array `rotatedBox` with the same number of cells as the input `box`.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** These complexities occur because we manually iterate over each cell in the input `box` and create a new 2D array to store the rotated box.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use the fact that the number of rows in the rotated box times the number of columns in the rotated box is equal to the total number of cells in the input `box`. This allows us to directly calculate the new position of each cell in the rotated box.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize an empty 2D array `rotatedBox` with the given number of rows and columns.
  2. Iterate over each cell in the input `box`.
  3. For each cell, calculate its new position in the rotated box based on the number of rows and columns.
  4. Place the cell in its new position in the `rotatedBox`.
- Proof of optimality: This approach has the same time and space complexity as the brute force approach, but it is more efficient in practice because it avoids unnecessary calculations.
- Why further optimization is impossible: This approach already has the optimal time and space complexity, so further optimization is not possible.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> rotateTheBox(vector<vector<int>>& box, int rows, int cols) {
    int m = box.size();
    int n = box[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> rotatedBox(rows, vector<int>(cols, 0));
    int index = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            rotatedBox[index / cols][index % cols] = box[i][j];
            index++;
        }
    }
    return rotatedBox;
}
```

> - **Optimality proof:** This approach has the optimal time and space complexity because it only requires a single pass over the input `box` and creates a new 2D array with the same number of cells as the input `box`.

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Iteration, array manipulation, and calculation of new positions.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Direct calculation of new positions based on the number of rows and columns.
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary calculations and using the properties of the input data to simplify the solution.
- Similar problems to practice: Problems involving array manipulation and rotation.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Incorrect calculation of new positions, incorrect initialization of the `rotatedBox`, and incorrect iteration over the input `box`.
- Edge cases to watch for: Input `box` with zero rows or columns, and input `rows` and `cols` that do not match the total number of cells in the input `box`.
- Performance pitfalls: Using unnecessary loops or calculations, and creating unnecessary intermediate arrays.
- Testing considerations: Testing the solution with different input sizes, shapes, and values to ensure correctness and efficiency.
