## Remove All Ones with Row and Column Flips II
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-ones-with-row-and-column-flips-ii/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: A 2D array `grid` of size `m x n`, where `m` and `n` are integers.
- Constraints: `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`, and `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- Expected output format: The minimum number of operations required to remove all ones from the grid.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: 
  - Each operation can flip all the elements in a row or a column.
  - The goal is to remove all ones from the grid in the minimum number of operations.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - For a grid `[[0,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]`, the output should be `3` because we can flip the first row, the second column, and the third column to remove all ones.
  - For a grid `[[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]`, the output should be `2` because we can flip the first row and the second column to remove all ones.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: Try all possible combinations of row and column flips to find the minimum number of operations required to remove all ones from the grid.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all possible combinations of row and column flips.
  2. For each combination, apply the flips to the grid and check if all ones are removed.
  3. Keep track of the minimum number of operations required to remove all ones.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It is a straightforward and intuitive approach to solve the problem, but it has an exponential time complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int minFlips(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int minOps = INT_MAX;
    
    // Generate all possible combinations of row and column flips
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << (m + n)); mask++) {
        vector<vector<int>> flippedGrid = grid;
        int ops = 0;
        
        // Apply row flips
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                ops++;
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    flippedGrid[i][j] = 1 - flippedGrid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Apply column flips
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << (m + j))) != 0) {
                ops++;
                for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                    flippedGrid[i][j] = 1 - flippedGrid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check if all ones are removed
        bool allZeros = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (flippedGrid[i][j] == 1) {
                    allZeros = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!allZeros) break;
        }
        
        if (allZeros) minOps = min(minOps, ops);
    }
    
    return minOps;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^{m+n} \cdot m \cdot n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the grid. This is because we generate all possible combinations of row and column flips, and for each combination, we apply the flips to the grid.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(m \cdot n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the grid. This is because we need to store the flipped grid.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The exponential time complexity occurs because we generate all possible combinations of row and column flips, which is $2^{m+n}$.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a greedy approach to find the minimum number of operations required to remove all ones from the grid.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Count the number of ones in each row and column.
  2. Sort the rows and columns by the count of ones in descending order.
  3. Iterate through the sorted rows and columns, and for each row or column with ones, flip it to remove the ones.
  4. Keep track of the minimum number of operations required to remove all ones.
- Proof of optimality: The greedy approach is optimal because it always chooses the row or column with the most ones to flip, which minimizes the number of operations required to remove all ones.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minFlips(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int minOps = 0;
    
    // Count the number of ones in each row and column
    vector<int> rowOnes(m, 0);
    vector<int> colOnes(n, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                rowOnes[i]++;
                colOnes[j]++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Sort the rows and columns by the count of ones in descending order
    vector<int> sortedRows(m);
    vector<int> sortedCols(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) sortedRows[i] = i;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) sortedCols[j] = j;
    sort(sortedRows.begin(), sortedRows.end(), [&](int a, int b) { return rowOnes[a] > rowOnes[b]; });
    sort(sortedCols.begin(), sortedCols.end(), [&](int a, int b) { return colOnes[a] > colOnes[b]; });
    
    // Iterate through the sorted rows and columns, and for each row or column with ones, flip it to remove the ones
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        if (rowOnes[sortedRows[i]] > 0) {
            minOps++;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                grid[sortedRows[i]][j] = 1 - grid[sortedRows[i]][j];
            }
        }
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (colOnes[sortedCols[j]] > 0) {
            minOps++;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                grid[i][sortedCols[j]] = 1 - grid[i][sortedCols[j]];
            }
        }
    }
    
    return minOps;
}
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Greedy approach, sorting, and flipping rows and columns.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Counting ones in rows and columns, sorting, and iterating through sorted rows and columns.
- Optimization techniques learned: Minimizing the number of operations required to remove all ones from the grid.
- Similar problems to practice: Other problems involving flipping rows and columns, such as [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-columns-for-maximum-number-of-equal-rows/).

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Not counting ones in rows and columns correctly, not sorting rows and columns correctly, and not iterating through sorted rows and columns correctly.
- Edge cases to watch for: Grids with all zeros, grids with all ones, and grids with an equal number of ones and zeros in each row and column.
- Performance pitfalls: Not using a greedy approach, not sorting rows and columns, and not iterating through sorted rows and columns.
- Testing considerations: Test the solution with different grid sizes, different numbers of ones and zeros, and different distributions of ones and zeros in the grid.
