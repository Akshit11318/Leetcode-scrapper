## Move Pieces to Obtain a String
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/move-pieces-to-obtain-a-string/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format: Three strings `start`, `target`, and `s`.
- Constraints: All strings consist only of lowercase English letters.
- Expected output format: A boolean indicating whether it is possible to rearrange the pieces in `start` to spell `target`.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: Handling cases where `start` or `target` is empty, ensuring that the pieces can be rearranged to spell `target`, and verifying that all characters in `target` are present in `start`.
- Example test cases with explanations:
  - Example 1: `start = "abc", target = "bca", s = "abc"` returns `true` because we can rearrange the pieces to spell `target`.
  - Example 2: `start = "abc", target = "bac", s = "cba"` returns `true` because we can rearrange the pieces to spell `target`.
  - Example 3: `start = "abc", target = "bac", s = "bca"` returns `false` because we cannot rearrange the pieces to spell `target`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: To solve this problem, we need to check all possible permutations of the `start` string and verify if any of them can be rearranged to spell `target`.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Generate all permutations of `start`.
  2. For each permutation, check if it can be rearranged to spell `target`.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: It's a straightforward approach that considers all possibilities.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

bool canConvertString(std::string start, std::string target, std::string s) {
    // Generate all permutations of start
    std::sort(start.begin(), start.end());
    do {
        // Check if the current permutation can be rearranged to spell target
        if (start == target) {
            return true;
        }
    } while (std::next_permutation(start.begin(), start.end()));

    return false;
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n!)$ where $n$ is the length of `start`, because we generate all permutations of `start`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ because we need to store the permutations.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** Generating all permutations of a string results in a factorial time complexity, and storing these permutations requires linear space.

### Optimal Approach (Required)

**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: We can use a two-pointer technique to compare `start` and `target`.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Initialize two pointers, one for `start` and one for `target`.
  2. Compare the characters at the current positions of `start` and `target`.
  3. If the characters match, move both pointers forward.
  4. If the characters do not match, move the pointer for `start` forward.
- Proof of optimality: This approach ensures that we only make one pass through `start` and `target`, resulting in a linear time complexity.

```cpp
#include <string>

bool canConvertString(std::string start, std::string target, std::string s) {
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < start.size() && j < target.size()) {
        if (start[i] == target[j]) {
            i++;
            j++;
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }

    return j == target.size();
}
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of `start`, because we make one pass through `start` and `target`.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ because we only use a constant amount of space.
> - **Optimality proof:** This approach ensures that we only make one pass through `start` and `target`, resulting in a linear time complexity.
