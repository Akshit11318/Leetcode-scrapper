## Flip Equivalent Binary Trees
**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-equivalent-binary-trees/description

**Problem Statement:**
- Input format and constraints: We are given the roots of two binary trees, `root1` and `root2`.
- Expected output format: The function should return `true` if the two binary trees are flip equivalent, and `false` otherwise.
- Key requirements and edge cases to consider: The trees are flip equivalent if they are mirror images of each other, or if one can be transformed into the other by flipping the left and right children of any number of nodes.
- Example test cases with explanations: For example, given two trees:
  ```
    1         1
   / \       / \
  2   3     3   2
  ```
  The function should return `true` because the two trees are flip equivalent.

### Brute Force Approach
**Explanation:**
- Initial thought process: One way to solve this problem is to generate all possible flip versions of the first tree and check if the second tree matches any of them.
- Step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
  1. Define a helper function to flip a binary tree.
  2. Generate all possible flip versions of the first tree by recursively flipping the left and right children of each node.
  3. Check if the second tree matches any of the flip versions.
- Why this approach comes to mind first: This approach seems straightforward because it directly addresses the concept of flip equivalence by generating all possible flips.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool flipEquiv(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        if (!root1 && !root2) return true;
        if (!root1 || !root2) return false;
        if (root1->val != root2->val) return false;
        
        // Check if the trees are the same without flipping
        if (isSameTree(root1, root2)) return true;
        
        // Flip the left and right children of root1 and check again
        TreeNode* temp = root1->left;
        root1->left = root1->right;
        root1->right = temp;
        
        return isSameTree(root1, root2);
    }
    
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        if (!root1 && !root2) return true;
        if (!root1 || !root2) return false;
        if (root1->val != root2->val) return false;
        
        return isSameTree(root1->left, root2->left) && isSameTree(root1->right, root2->right);
    }
};
```

> Complexity Analysis:
> - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of nodes in the two trees, because in the worst case we need to visit each node once.
> - **Space Complexity:** $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack.
> - **Why these complexities occur:** The time complexity is linear because we potentially visit each node once, and the space complexity is related to the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.

### Optimal Approach (Required)
**Explanation:**
- Key insight that leads to optimal solution: Instead of generating all possible flips, we can directly compare the trees while considering the possibility of flipping at each node.
- Detailed breakdown of the approach:
  1. Define a recursive function that checks if two trees are flip equivalent.
  2. At each node, check if the values match and if the left and right children can be made equivalent by flipping or not flipping.
- Proof of optimality: This approach is optimal because it avoids generating unnecessary flip versions and directly checks for equivalence with a possible flip at each step.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool flipEquiv(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        if (!root1 && !root2) return true;
        if (!root1 || !root2) return false;
        if (root1->val != root2->val) return false;
        
        // Check without flipping
        bool noFlip = flipEquiv(root1->left, root2->left) && flipEquiv(root1->right, root2->right);
        
        // Check with flipping
        bool flip = flipEquiv(root1->left, root2->right) && flipEquiv(root1->right, root2->left);
        
        return noFlip || flip;
    }
};
```

### Final Notes

**Learning Points:**
- Key algorithmic concepts demonstrated: Recursion, tree traversal, and the concept of flip equivalence in binary trees.
- Problem-solving patterns identified: Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems (checking equivalence of subtrees) and considering different scenarios (flipping or not flipping).
- Optimization techniques learned: Avoiding unnecessary computations by directly checking for equivalence with a possible flip.

**Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Common implementation errors: Forgetting to handle the base cases for recursion (e.g., when both trees are null) or incorrectly flipping the trees.
- Edge cases to watch for: Ensuring that the function correctly handles trees of different sizes or structures.
- Performance pitfalls: Avoiding the generation of all possible flips, which can lead to exponential time complexity.
